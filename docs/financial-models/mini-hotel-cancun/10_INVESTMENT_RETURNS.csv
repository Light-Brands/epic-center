INVESTOR RECOMMENDATION
The Mini Hotel Cancun project offers attractive financial returns
18.5% IRR and 2.97x MOIC in base case
However critical brand alignment concerns must be addressed
Urban location incompatible with premium wellness positioning
Consider as support facility rather than primary treatment center
If proceeding financial returns are compelling despite brand risk
