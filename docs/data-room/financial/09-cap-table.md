## 2. Total Capital Required

The total capital requirement for the Transformational Epicenter project has been determined through detailed bottom-up budgeting (see Document 06: Financial Projections).

| Component | Amount | % of Total |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Property Acquisition | $6,150,000 | 41.1% |
| Renovation | $4,050,000 | 27.1% |
| Technology Platform | $1,230,000 | 8.2% |
| Working Capital | $1,126,000 | 7.5% |
| Contingency | $847,500 | 5.7% |
| Medical Equipment | $750,000 | 5.0% |
| FF&E | $600,000 | 4.0% |
| Pre-Opening | $200,000 | 1.3% |
| **Total Capital Required** | **$16,823,500** | **100%** |

*Technology Platform includes $1,000,000 AI platform and $230,000 physical infrastructure.*

### Capital Structure Considerations

The capital structure is expected to be primarily equity-funded, with potential for a senior secured facility against the real property once acquired. The equity-heavy structure reflects:

- **Early-stage risk profile** -- Pre-revenue, pre-construction projects command equity rather than debt pricing
- **Real asset backing** -- The $5.8M property acquisition provides tangible collateral that supports future debt financing
- **Operational flexibility** -- An equity-heavy balance sheet avoids mandatory debt service during the critical ramp period
- **Investor alignment** -- Equity participation ensures all stakeholders share in both risk and upside

---

## 3. Proposed Equity Structure

The proposed equity structure contemplates three share classes designed to accommodate different investor profiles and align incentives across the stakeholder base.

### Share Class Overview

**Class A -- Common Shares**
- **Holders:** Founders & Management
- **Purpose:** Align operating team incentives with long-term value creation
- **Characteristics:** Voting rights, participation in distributions after preferred return thresholds, subject to vesting schedules

**Class B -- Preferred Shares**
- **Holders:** Institutional / Lead Investors
- **Purpose:** Attract anchor capital with appropriate investor protections
- **Characteristics:** Preferred return, liquidation preference, enhanced governance rights, information rights, anti-dilution protection

**Class C -- Preferred Shares**
- **Holders:** Individual Accredited Investors
- **Purpose:** Enable qualified individual participation in the capital raise
- **Characteristics:** Preferred return (pari passu with Class B), liquidation preference, standard information rights, tag-along rights

### Class Structure Rationale

The three-class structure is designed to:

1. **Separate operating control from financial participation** -- Founders retain operational decision-making authority through Class A voting rights while investors receive financial protections through preferred classes
2. **Differentiate institutional and individual investors** -- Class B offers enhanced governance suitable for anchor investors committing larger amounts; Class C provides a streamlined structure for individual accredited investors
3. **Align incentives** -- All classes participate in upside through the distribution waterfall, with preferred classes receiving return of capital and preferred return before common class participation begins

---

## 4. Proposed Allocation Framework

The following allocation framework is **illustrative only** and **subject to final terms** negotiated with lead investors and documented in the operating agreement.

| Share Class | Proposed Allocation | Rights | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------:|--------|-------|
| Class A (Common) | *Subject to Final Terms* | Voting, management control, distribution participation | Founders & key management; subject to vesting |
| Class B (Preferred) | *Subject to Final Terms* | Preferred return, liquidation preference, board representation, information rights | Institutional / lead investors; minimum commitment TBD |
| Class C (Preferred) | *Subject to Final Terms* | Preferred return, liquidation preference, information rights, tag-along | Individual accredited investors; minimum commitment TBD |
| **Employee Option Pool** | *Subject to Final Terms* | Options to purchase Class A; subject to vesting | Reserved for key hires and advisors |

### Allocation Principles

The final allocation will be guided by the following principles:

- **Founder alignment** -- Founders retain sufficient equity to be meaningfully incentivized for long-term value creation, subject to vesting
- **Investor protection** -- Preferred classes receive appropriate protections commensurate with the risk profile of an early-stage, pre-revenue project
- **Employee retention** -- An option pool of sufficient size to attract and retain world-class medical, operational, and hospitality talent
- **Anti-dilution balance** -- Dilution protection mechanisms that protect existing investors while preserving flexibility for future capital raises

## 5. Vesting Schedule Framework

All equity and option grants are subject to vesting schedules designed to ensure long-term commitment and alignment with project milestones.

### Vesting Terms

| Stakeholder | Vesting Period | Cliff Period | Acceleration Events |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Founders | 4-year vesting | 1-year cliff | Change of control (double-trigger) |
| Key Executives | 4-year vesting | 1-year cliff | Change of control (double-trigger) |
| Advisory Board | 2-year vesting | 6-month cliff | None |
| Employee Options | 4-year vesting | 1-year cliff | Change of control (single-trigger) |

### Vesting Schedule Detail

**Founders (4-year, 1-year cliff)**
- No equity vests during the first 12 months (cliff period)
- At the 12-month cliff, 25% of total allocation vests immediately
- Remaining 75% vests monthly over the subsequent 36 months (2.08% per month)
- Double-trigger acceleration: vesting accelerates only if a change of control occurs AND the founder is terminated without cause within 12 months of the change of control

**Key Executives (4-year, 1-year cliff)**
- Same structure as founders
- Double-trigger acceleration protects against post-acquisition involuntary termination
- Unvested equity is forfeited upon voluntary departure

**Advisory Board (2-year, 6-month cliff)**
- 6-month cliff with 25% vesting at cliff
- Remaining 75% vests quarterly over the subsequent 18 months
- No acceleration provisions; advisory relationships are expected to be lower-intensity commitments

### Good Leaver / Bad Leaver Provisions

| Departure Type | Vested Equity | Unvested Equity |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Voluntary resignation | Retained | Forfeited |
| Termination without cause | Retained | Accelerated vesting (12 months) |
| Termination for cause | Retained (subject to clawback) | Forfeited |
| Death or disability | Retained | Fully accelerated |
| Change of control (double-trigger) | Retained | Fully accelerated |

## 6. Investor Rights Summary

Investor rights will be documented in the operating agreement and ancillary documents. The following summary outlines the anticipated rights framework, subject to negotiation and legal finalization.

### Information Rights

| Right | Class B | Class C |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Annual audited financial statements | Yes | Yes |
| Quarterly unaudited financial statements | Yes | Yes |
| Monthly operating metrics dashboard | Yes | No |
| Annual budget and business plan | Yes | No |
| Board observer rights | Yes (1 seat per major investor) | No |
| Ad hoc information requests | Reasonable requests | Reasonable requests |

### Governance Rights

| Right | Class B | Class C |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Board representation | Yes (proportional to investment) | No |
| Protective provisions (veto rights) | Yes (see below) | No |
| Pro rata rights (future rounds) | Yes | Yes |
| Tag-along rights | Yes | Yes |
| Drag-along rights | Yes (subject to threshold) | Subject to drag |
| Right of first refusal on transfers | Yes | Yes |

### Protective Provisions (Class B Veto Rights)

Class B holders, acting by majority, shall have the right to approve or veto the following actions:

- Issuance of new equity or equity-linked securities
- Sale, merger, or dissolution of the company
- Incurrence of debt above a threshold amount (to be defined)
- Related-party transactions above a threshold amount
- Changes to the operating agreement or share class rights
- Annual budget approval (if materially exceeding prior year)
- Hiring or termination of C-suite executives

These protective provisions are standard for preferred equity investors in early-stage ventures and are intended to protect investor capital while allowing management operational flexibility.

## 7. Distribution Waterfall

The distribution waterfall governs how cash available for distribution is allocated among the share classes. The proposed structure follows a standard preferred equity waterfall.

### Proposed Waterfall Structure

**Tier 1: Return of Capital**
- All invested capital is returned to preferred shareholders (Class B and Class C, pari passu) before any distributions to common shareholders
- Return of capital is calculated on a dollar-for-dollar basis (no interest accrual during the return period)

**Tier 2: Preferred Return**
- After return of capital, preferred shareholders receive a cumulative preferred return on their invested capital
- Preferred return rate: *Subject to Final Terms* (anticipated range: 8-12% annually)
- Preferred return accrues from the date of investment and compounds annually
- Catch-up provision may apply to accelerate preferred return payments

**Tier 3: Profit Split**
- After return of capital and preferred return are satisfied, remaining distributions are split among all share classes based on their pro rata equity ownership
- The profit split ratio between preferred and common classes: *Subject to Final Terms*
- Management may receive a promote or carried interest above a threshold return: *Subject to Final Terms*

### Illustrative Waterfall Example

*The following example is illustrative only, using placeholder percentages to demonstrate the waterfall mechanics. Actual percentages are subject to final terms.*

| Distribution Phase | Class A (Common) | Class B (Preferred) | Class C (Preferred) |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Return of Capital | $0 | Pro rata | Pro rata |
| Preferred Return | $0 | Pro rata | Pro rata |
| Profit Split | *Subject to Final Terms* | *Subject to Final Terms* | *Subject to Final Terms* |

### Distribution Timing

- Distributions are expected to begin after Year 1 of operations, subject to working capital requirements and board approval
- Quarterly or semi-annual distribution frequency is anticipated
- The board retains discretion to retain cash for capital expenditures, expansion, or reserves

---

## 8. Dilution Protection

### Anti-Dilution Provisions

Preferred shareholders will receive anti-dilution protection against down-round financing. The proposed framework includes:

**Weighted Average Anti-Dilution**
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution adjustment in the event of a subsequent equity issuance at a lower price per share
- This is the investor-friendly standard that provides protection while being less punitive to founders than full ratchet anti-dilution

**Pre-Emptive Rights**
- Preferred shareholders have the right to participate pro rata in any future equity issuances to maintain their ownership percentage
- Pre-emptive rights are transferable to affiliates

**Exceptions**
The following issuances are excluded from anti-dilution protection:
- Employee option pool grants (up to the reserved pool size)
- Equity issued in connection with strategic partnerships approved by the board
- Equity issued in connection with an acquisition approved by the board

### Dilution Scenarios

| Event | Impact on Existing Holders | Protection |
|-------|---------------------------|------------|
| Future equity raise (up-round) | Diluted on shares, increased on value | Pro rata participation right |
| Future equity raise (down-round) | Anti-dilution adjustment | Weighted average price protection |
| Employee option exercise | Minor dilution | Capped by reserved pool size |
| Conversion of debt | Potential dilution | Pre-negotiated conversion terms |
