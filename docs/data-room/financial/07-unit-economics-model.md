## 1. Executive Summary

The Transformational Epicenter unit economics model demonstrates a highly attractive per-guest margin structure that provides significant operating leverage as occupancy scales. At the weighted average revenue per guest of $26,600 and direct cost of $4,629, each guest generates $21,971 in gross profit at an 83% margin.

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **Average Revenue Per Guest** | **$26,600** |
| **Direct Cost Per Guest** | **$4,629** |
| **Gross Profit Per Guest** | **$21,971** |
| **Gross Margin** | **83%** |

This margin profile is among the highest in the luxury wellness and medical tourism sectors, driven by the premium pricing tier ($2,000/day), the high value-to-cost ratio of the core treatment modalities, and the capital-light nature of service delivery once facility infrastructure is in place.

### Why These Economics Work

The Transformational Epicenter's unit economics benefit from three structural advantages:

1. **Premium pricing power** -- Guests seeking medically supervised plant medicine treatment in a luxury setting have limited alternatives, supporting $2,000/day pricing that is competitive within the category while generating substantial margins
2. **Low variable cost base** -- The primary cost inputs (medical oversight, facilitators, plant medicine materials, food) scale modestly per guest compared to revenue, maintaining gross margins above 80% across all occupancy levels
3. **High fixed-cost leverage** -- The fixed cost base (management, facilities, insurance) is spread across more guests as capacity and occupancy increase, driving EBITDA margin expansion from 42% in Year 1 (23 rooms, 60% occupancy) to 60% by Year 5 (57 rooms, 80% occupancy)

## 2. Revenue Per Guest

Revenue per guest is calculated as the weighted average across all program offerings based on the expected program mix. In the base model, bio-optimization add-ons are not included in per-guest revenue, representing future upside potential.

| Revenue Component | Amount | % of Total | Notes |
|-------------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Base Program Fee (Weighted Avg) | $26,600 | 100% | Weighted across 7/14/21/28-day programs |
| Bio-optimization Add-ons | $0 | 0% | Not modeled in base case; future upside |
| **TOTAL Revenue Per Guest** | **$26,600** | **100%** | |

### Revenue Per Guest Commentary

The $26,600 weighted average reflects the current program mix skewed toward shorter-duration programs (45% of guests selecting the 7-Day Reset). As brand awareness grows and guests increasingly seek deeper transformational experiences, the mix may shift toward longer programs, which would increase the weighted average revenue per guest.

Bio-optimization add-on services (IV therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, advanced diagnostics, neurofeedback) represent a meaningful revenue opportunity not captured in the base model. Comparable luxury medical facilities report add-on revenue of 10-20% of base program fees, which would add $2,660-$5,320 per guest. This upside is intentionally excluded to maintain conservative projections.

---

## 3. Program Pricing

All programs are priced at a flat rate of $2,000 per day. The weighted average revenue per guest of $26,600 reflects the mix of program durations, with shorter programs representing a larger share of guest volume.

| Program | Duration | Daily Rate | Total Price | Mix % | Revenue Contribution |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| 7-Day Reset | 7 days | $2,000/day | $14,000 | 45% | $6,300 |
| 14-Day Program | 14 days | $2,000/day | $28,000 | 30% | $8,400 |
| 21-Day Program | 21 days | $2,000/day | $42,000 | 15% | $6,300 |
| 28-Day Transformation | 28 days | $2,000/day | $56,000 | 10% | $5,600 |
| **Weighted Average** | **13 days** | **$2,000/day** | **$26,600** | **100%** | **$26,600** |

### Program Mix Rationale

**7-Day Reset (45%)** -- The entry-level program is expected to attract the largest share of first-time guests. Seven days provides sufficient duration for an initial ibogaine or psilocybin treatment with basic integration. Many 7-day guests are expected to return for longer programs, creating a natural upsell pathway.

**14-Day Program (30%)** -- The 14-day program is the core offering, providing two weeks of medical supervision, plant medicine ceremony, bio-optimization protocols, and structured integration. This duration aligns with the typical treatment arc for ibogaine-assisted therapy.

**21-Day Program (15%)** -- The extended program serves guests requiring deeper intervention, including those with complex trauma histories or multiple treatment objectives. Three weeks allows for multiple ceremony sessions with extended integration periods between treatments.

**28-Day Transformation (10%)** -- The full transformation program is the premium offering, providing a comprehensive month-long arc from preparation through deep treatment to early integration. This program is expected to attract the most committed guests with the highest lifetime value.

### Weighted Average Calculation

$$\text{Weighted Avg Price} = (0.45 \times \$14{,}000) + (0.30 \times \$28{,}000) + (0.15 \times \$42{,}000) + (0.10 \times \$56{,}000) = \$26{,}600$$

$$\text{Weighted Avg Duration} = (0.45 \times 7) + (0.30 \times 14) + (0.15 \times 21) + (0.10 \times 28) = 13.3 \approx 13 \text{ days}$$

## 4. Direct Costs Per Guest

Direct costs represent variable expenses that are incurred on a per-guest basis. These costs scale with guest volume and are the primary determinant of gross margin. Total direct cost per guest is $4,629, representing 17% of revenue.

| Cost Category | Amount | % of Revenue | Notes |
|---------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Medical Staff & Oversight | $1,320 | 5% | 24/7 physician coverage, nurse allocation, monitoring |
| Facilitators & Therapy | $640 | 2% | Ceremony facilitation, integration sessions, somatic therapy |
| Food & Hospitality | $560 | 2% | Premium organic meals, functional cuisine, dietary protocols |
| Bio-optimization Supplies | $160 | 1% | IV supplies, biologics, supplement protocols |
| Plant Medicine Materials | $640 | 2% | Ibogaine, psilocybin, preparation materials |
| Guest Amenities | $500 | 2% | Welcome kit, excursions, therapeutic massage, personal items |
| Medical Evacuation Reserve | $809 | 3% | Emergency fund allocation per guest |
| **TOTAL Direct Cost** | **$4,629** | **17%** | |

### Cost Category Detail

**Medical Staff & Oversight ($1,320 / 5%)** -- This allocation covers the per-guest share of 24/7 physician coverage, nursing staff dedicated to guest monitoring, and medical team coordination. The cost is calculated by dividing total medical staff compensation by expected guest volume, with adjustments for intensity of monitoring during treatment phases versus recovery phases.

**Facilitators & Therapy ($640 / 2%)** -- Includes ceremony facilitation fees, integration therapy sessions (typically 1-2 per day during active treatment), somatic experiencing practitioners, and group facilitation costs. The cost reflects a blend of in-house staff and specialized contract practitioners for specific modalities.

**Food & Hospitality ($560 / 2%)** -- Covers premium organic food service (three meals plus snacks), functional beverage programs, specialized dietary protocols (pre-ceremony fasting, post-ceremony nourishment), and kitchen staff allocation. The $43/day food cost per guest is competitive with luxury resort food and beverage operations while supporting the "food as medicine" program philosophy.

**Bio-optimization Supplies ($160 / 1%)** -- Consumable supplies for IV therapy (NAD+, vitamin infusions, glutathione), biological materials for regenerative treatments, and supplement protocols. This cost does not include durable equipment, which is capitalized in the project budget.

**Plant Medicine Materials ($640 / 2%)** -- Ethically sourced ibogaine hydrochloride, psilocybin preparations, and supporting ceremonial materials. Ibogaine cost reflects medical-grade sourcing with full chain-of-custody documentation. This line item also includes laboratory testing and quality assurance for each batch.

**Guest Amenities ($500 / 2%)** -- Welcome kit (journal, ceremonial blanket, personal items), curated excursions (cenote visits, jungle walks, beach outings), daily therapeutic massage, and personal care items. These amenities reinforce the luxury positioning and contribute to guest satisfaction and referral rates.

**Medical Evacuation Reserve ($809 / 3%)** -- A per-guest reserve fund for emergency medical evacuation. While serious adverse events are rare with proper screening and monitoring (industry data suggests less than 1% incidence rate for ibogaine-assisted therapy with full medical protocols), the reserve provides a financial buffer for emergency airlift, hospital transfer, and extended medical care costs. Unused reserves accumulate as a safety fund.

## 5. Contribution Margin Analysis

The contribution margin represents the profit available from each guest to cover fixed operating expenses and generate net income. At $21,971 per guest, the contribution margin provides substantial operating leverage.

| Line Item | Amount | % of Revenue |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Revenue Per Guest | $26,600 | 100% |
| Less: Direct Costs | ($4,629) | (17%) |
| **Gross Profit Per Guest** | **$21,971** | **83%** |

### Margin Context

An 83% gross margin positions Transformational Epicenter in the upper tier of hospitality and medical services businesses.

| Industry Benchmark | Typical Gross Margin |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Luxury Hotels | 65-75% |
| Medical Clinics | 55-70% |
| Spa & Wellness Resorts | 60-75% |
| Addiction Treatment Centers | 70-80% |
| **Transformational Epicenter** | **83%** |

The margin advantage reflects the premium pricing tier ($2,000/day vs. $500-$1,200/day for most luxury wellness competitors) combined with a cost structure that does not scale proportionally. A guest paying $2,000/day requires similar medical oversight, facilitator time, and food cost as a guest paying $1,000/day at a lower-tier facility -- but generates twice the revenue.

## 6. Fixed Cost Allocation Per Guest

Fixed operating expenses are allocated across guests on a per-capita basis. The Transformational Epicenter uses a phased casita model (15 to 60 casitas over five years), meaning both capacity and occupancy increase over time, creating a dual growth dynamic that drives significant EBITDA margin expansion. Year 1 fixed operating expenses are $4,206,000.

| Year | Casitas | Eff. Rooms | Occupancy | Guests | Fixed OpEx | Fixed Cost/Guest | Total Cost/Guest | EBITDA/Guest | EBITDA Margin |
|------|---------|------------|-----------|--------|------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Y1 | 15→30 | 23 | 60% | 387 | $4,206,000 | $10,868 | $15,497 | $11,103 | 42% |
| Y2 | 30→40 | 35 | 75% | 737 | $5,500,000 | $7,462 | $12,091 | $14,509 | 55% |
| Y3 | 40→48 | 44 | 80% | 988 | $6,500,000 | $6,579 | $11,208 | $15,392 | 58% |
| Y4 | 48→54 | 51 | 80% | 1,145 | $6,868,000 | $5,997 | $10,626 | $15,974 | 60% |
| Y5 | 54→60 | 57 | 80% | 1,280 | $7,776,000 | $6,075 | $10,704 | $15,896 | 60% |

### Key Insight

The phased casita model creates a dual growth engine: increasing both the number of casitas online and occupancy rates simultaneously. As the facility scales from 23 effective rooms in Year 1 to 57 in Year 5, and occupancy ramps from 60% to 80%, the fixed cost burden per guest declines from $10,868 to $6,075 -- driving EBITDA margin expansion from 42% to 60%.

This demonstrates that the path to profitability improvement is driven by both capacity expansion and occupancy growth. The operating model generates attractive returns even in Year 1 with only 15-30 casitas and becomes highly profitable as the full 60-casita campus comes online.

## 7. Breakeven Analysis

### Guest-Level Breakeven

At the per-guest level, every guest is profitable from the first booking. Direct costs of $4,629 are well below the $26,600 revenue per guest, meaning each guest contributes $21,971 to fixed cost coverage and profit.

### Facility-Level Breakeven

The facility-level breakeven considers the minimum operating cost structure required to keep the facility open. With the phased casita model, the initial phase (15 casitas) can operate with a lean cost base:

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Minimum Fixed Operating Expenses (Phase 1) | ~$549,000 |
| Contribution Margin Per Guest | $21,971 |
| **Breakeven Guest Volume** | **~25 guests/year** |
| **Breakeven Occupancy** | **~3%** |

### Breakeven Sensitivity

| Cost Scenario | Fixed Costs | Breakeven Guests | Breakeven Occupancy |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Minimum Viable (Phase 1) | ~$549,000 | ~25 | ~3% |
| Lean Operations | $2,500,000 | 114 | ~14% |
| Year 1 Budgeted | $4,206,000 | 192 | ~24% |
| Full Campus (Y5) | $7,776,000 | 354 | ~22% |

### Breakeven Commentary

The facility-level breakeven at approximately 25 guests per year (~3% occupancy) represents an extraordinarily wide margin of safety relative to projected operating occupancy of 60-80%. The phased casita model means the facility can operate with minimal fixed costs in its earliest phase, requiring fewer than 1 guest per week to cover baseline operating costs -- providing substantial downside protection against slower-than-expected ramp, seasonal fluctuations, or temporary demand disruptions.

At the projected Year 1 volume of 387 guests, the facility operates at over 15x its minimum breakeven point. This cushion provides confidence that the operation can weather significant demand variability while remaining profitable.

## 8. Scalability & Margin Expansion

### Revenue Scalability

The unit economics model supports significant revenue scalability through multiple levers:

**Occupancy & Capacity Growth** -- The phased casita model (15 to 60 casitas over five years) combined with occupancy ramp from 60% to 80% drives revenue from $10.3M in Year 1 to $34.0M in Year 5. This dual growth dynamic is the primary value creation lever.

**Program Mix Shift** -- As brand reputation strengthens and return guests seek deeper experiences, the program mix is expected to shift toward longer-duration programs. A 5-point shift from 7-day to 14-day programs would increase weighted average revenue per guest by approximately $2,100 (8%).

**Bio-optimization Add-ons** -- Add-on services represent the largest unmodeled revenue opportunity. At a conservative 15% attach rate with $3,000 average add-on spend, this would add approximately $450 per guest to the weighted average -- or $576K in annual revenue at 1,280 guests (Year 5).

**Price Escalation** -- The base model assumes flat $2,000/day pricing over five years. Even modest annual price increases of 3-5% would compound to $2,319-$2,553/day by Year 5, adding $5.4M-$7.4M in incremental annual revenue at Year 5 stabilized occupancy (1,280 guests).

### Cost Scalability

**Direct Costs** -- Direct costs scale linearly with guest volume at approximately $4,629 per guest. While individual cost components may experience inflation (medical supplies, food costs), the overall cost per guest is expected to grow at 3-4% annually, below revenue growth rates.

**Fixed Costs** -- Fixed operating expenses scale with the number of casitas online, growing from $4,206,000 in Year 1 (15-30 casitas) to approximately $7,776,000 in Year 5 (54-60 casitas). Despite this growth, the per-guest fixed cost burden declines as capacity and occupancy increase, providing significant operating leverage. The key Year 1 fixed cost components are:

| Fixed Cost Category | Year 1 | Growth Rate | Nature |
|--------------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Management & Admin | $1,650,000 | 4% | Salaries, benefits, professional services |
| Facilities & Maintenance | $850,000 | 4% | Property upkeep, utilities, groundskeeping |
| Insurance | $625,000 | 5% | Medical malpractice, general liability, property |
| Marketing & Sales | $700,000 | 3% | Digital marketing, referral programs, PR |
| General & Administrative | $381,000 | 4% | Legal, accounting, compliance, office |
| **Total Fixed OpEx** | **$4,206,000** | **Scales with phasing** | |

### Margin Expansion Trajectory

| Metric | Y1 (23 rooms, 60%) | Y3 (44 rooms, 80%) | Y5 (57 rooms, 80%) | Potential (+ Add-ons) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Revenue/Guest | $26,600 | $26,600 | $26,600 | $29,600+ |
| Direct Cost/Guest | $4,629 | $4,629 | $4,629 | $5,100 |
| Gross Margin | 83% | 83% | 83% | 83% |
| Fixed Cost/Guest | $10,868 | $6,579 | $6,075 | $6,075 |
| EBITDA Margin | 42% | 58% | 60% | 63%+ |

### Long-Term Unit Economics Potential

At full operational maturity with bio-optimization add-ons, a favorable program mix shift, and modest pricing power, the unit economics profile strengthens further:

| Mature State Metric | Current Model | Potential |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Revenue Per Guest | $26,600 | $32,000-$35,000 |
| Direct Cost Per Guest | $4,629 | $5,200-$5,500 |
| Gross Profit Per Guest | $21,971 | $26,800-$29,500 |
| Gross Margin | 83% | 84-85% |
| EBITDA Per Guest (Y5) | $15,896 | $22,000-$25,000 |

These potential improvements are not included in the financial projections (Document 06) and represent upside that could materially enhance investor returns if realized.
