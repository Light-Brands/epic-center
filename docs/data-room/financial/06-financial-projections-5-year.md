## 1. Executive Summary Metrics

The Transformational Epicenter five-year financial model projects strong revenue generation and attractive investor returns driven by premium pricing, high gross margins, and disciplined cost management. The base case reflects a phased ramp to 80% occupancy by Year 3, sustained through Years 4 and 5, with a 30-bed capacity across the Riviera Maya Jungle Estate.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Project Cost** | **$13,773,500** |
| **Year 1 Revenue** | **$13,140,400** |
| **5-Year Total Revenue** | **$82,140,800** |
| **Year 5 Enterprise Value (Base)** | **$87,924,380** |
| **Project IRR (Base Case, with Exit)** | **73.50%** |
| **5-Year MOIC (incl. Exit)** | **6.69x** |

### Investment Highlights

- **High-margin revenue model** with 83% gross margins in Year 1 declining modestly to 80% at maturity, driven by premium pricing of $2,000/day and efficient direct cost structure
- **Rapid payback** with Year 1 cash from operations of $5.6M against total project cost of $13.8M, achieving cumulative ROI of 50% in Year 1
- **Defensible economics** supported by a break-even occupancy rate significantly below projected operating levels
- **Capital-efficient scaling** with the property's 30-bed capacity fully available from opening, requiring no additional construction capital to reach full revenue potential

## 2. Key Investment Metrics - Scenario Analysis

Three scenarios model the range of expected outcomes based on occupancy rates, ramp timelines, and market conditions. All scenarios assume the same acquisition price and total project cost, varying only on the revenue side.

| Metric | Base Case | Conservative | Aggressive |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Acquisition Price** | $5,800,000 | $5,800,000 | $5,800,000 |
| **Total Project Cost** | $13,773,500 | $13,773,500 | $13,773,500 |
| **Year 1 Revenue** | $13,140,400 | $5,784,167 | $9,497,964 |
| **Year 3 Revenue** | $17,529,400 | $11,160,888 | $14,665,114 |
| **Year 5 Revenue** | $17,529,400 | $12,964,175 | $16,156,481 |
| **5-Year Total Revenue** | $82,140,800 | $51,158,779 | $68,804,678 |
| **Year 5 Enterprise Value** | $87,924,380 | $61,992,616 | $117,584,039 |
| **Project IRR (with Exit)** | 73.50% | 66.54% | 80.09% |
| **5-Year MOIC (incl. Exit)** | 6.69x | 4.65x | 8.94x |

### Scenario Definitions

**Base Case** -- Assumes 60% occupancy in Year 1, ramping to 75% in Year 2, and stabilizing at 80% from Year 3 onward. Pricing holds at $2,000/day with the current program mix. This scenario reflects management's best estimate of achievable performance given the property's location, competitive positioning, and planned marketing investment.

**Conservative Case** -- Assumes a slower ramp with lower occupancy in early years and more modest pricing power. This case models headwinds including slower brand awareness growth, regional competition, and potential macroeconomic softness in the luxury wellness segment. Even in this downside scenario, the project generates attractive returns with a 66.54% IRR and 4.65x MOIC over five years, producing $62.0M in enterprise value.

**Aggressive Case** -- Assumes faster market penetration, higher occupancy, and potential pricing upside from premium program offerings. This case reflects a scenario where brand traction exceeds expectations, referral rates are high, and the Riviera Maya Jungle Estate establishes itself rapidly as the category-defining facility. The aggressive case projects an 80.09% IRR, 8.94x MOIC, and $117.6M enterprise value at Year 5 exit.

## 3. Funding Allocation

Total project funding of $13,773,500 is allocated across eight categories. The acquisition cost includes the property purchase price of $5,800,000 plus closing costs, legal fees, and due diligence expenses.

| Category | Amount | % of Total | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Acquisition | $6,150,000 | 45% | Property purchase, closing costs, legal, due diligence |
| Renovation | $4,050,000 | 29% | Medical conversion, luxury finishes, infrastructure |
| Medical Equipment | $750,000 | 5% | ICU capability, cardiac monitoring, lab equipment |
| FF&E | $600,000 | 4% | Furniture, fixtures, guest room outfitting |
| Technology | $50,000 | 0% | Platform infrastructure, HIPAA-compliant systems |
| Pre-opening | $200,000 | 1% | Staff recruitment, training, marketing launch |
| Working Capital | $1,126,000 | 8% | Operating runway, initial inventory, deposits |
| Contingency | $847,500 | 6% | Construction overruns, unforeseen costs |
| **TOTAL** | **$13,773,500** | **100%** | |

### Funding Allocation Commentary

**Acquisition (45%)** -- The single largest allocation covers the Riviera Maya Jungle Estate purchase at $5,800,000 plus associated transaction costs. The property's 45,000 m2 compound across 9 lots in Tulum, Q.R. provides the physical foundation for 30 treatment rooms with existing structural improvements that significantly reduce renovation scope compared to greenfield development.

**Renovation (29%)** -- Medical conversion of the existing jungle compound requires hospital-grade electrical systems, plumbing for treatment rooms, ICU-capable infrastructure, and luxury interior finishes consistent with premium positioning. This budget assumes retention of existing structural elements where possible.

**Contingency (6%)** -- A 6% contingency reserve provides buffer for construction cost overruns, supply chain delays, and regulatory compliance costs. This is conservative relative to standard real estate development contingencies of 10-15%, reflecting the reduced risk of renovation versus new construction.

## 4. 5-Year Capacity Model

The property supports 30 available beds from Year 1. Occupancy ramps from 60% in Year 1 to a stabilized 80% from Year 3 onward. Guest counts are derived from occupancy rates applied to available bed-nights, adjusted for average length of stay.

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | 5-Year Total |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Available Beds** | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | -- |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 60% | 75% | 80% | 80% | 80% | -- |
| **Guests Served** | 494 | 617 | 659 | 659 | 659 | **3,088** |

### Capacity Assumptions

- **30 beds** reflects full buildout of the Riviera Maya Jungle Estate across the phased 16-to-30 room expansion during 2026
- **Average length of stay** of 13 days (weighted across the 7/14/21/28-day program mix)
- **Occupancy** is calculated as occupied bed-nights divided by available bed-nights, net of turnover days between guests
- **Guest count** is derived by dividing total occupied bed-nights by the weighted average stay length
- **Year 1 occupancy of 60%** reflects a soft opening period and initial marketing ramp; the 30-bed capacity is available from launch due to phased buildout completion
- **Stabilized occupancy of 80%** from Year 3 reflects management's view of sustainable utilization given the premium pricing tier and seasonal demand patterns in the Riviera Maya

| **Net Margin** | **39%** | **42%** | **42%** | **41%** | **40%** | **41%** |

### P&L Commentary

**Revenue Growth** -- Total revenue grows from $13.1M in Year 1 to $17.5M by Year 3, driven entirely by occupancy ramp from 60% to 80%. Pricing remains flat at $2,000/day across all years in the base case; no inflation or price increases are assumed, providing conservative upside optionality.

**Gross Margin Compression** -- Modest gross margin decline from 83% to 80% over five years reflects anticipated cost escalation in medical supplies, staff compensation growth, and rising food/hospitality input costs. Management believes 80% gross margins are sustainable at the premium pricing tier.

**Operating Leverage** -- Fixed operating expenses grow at approximately 4% annually (below revenue growth), driving EBITDA margin expansion from 60% in Year 1 to a peak of 63% in Years 2-3 before normalizing at 60% as cost escalation catches up with stable revenue.

**Net Income** -- Five-year cumulative net income of $33.5M represents a 41% average net margin, demonstrating the capital efficiency of the operating model at scale.

## 6. Cash Flow Summary

| Line Item | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | 5-Year Total |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Cash from Operations** | $5,623,215 | $7,340,527 | $7,819,403 | $7,635,710 | $7,444,670 | **$35,863,525** |
| **Cash from Investing** | ($12,647,500) | ($400,000) | ($500,000) | ($600,000) | ($700,000) | **($14,847,500)** |
| | | | | | | |
| **Net Cash Flow** | ($7,024,285) | $6,940,527 | $7,319,403 | $7,035,710 | $6,744,670 | **$21,016,025** |

### Cash Flow Commentary

**Year 1 Investing Outflow** -- The ($12.6M) Year 1 investing outflow represents the bulk of project capital deployment: property acquisition, renovation, medical equipment, FF&E, and technology infrastructure. Subsequent years reflect ongoing maintenance capital expenditures of $400K-$700K, escalating as the facility ages.

**Operating Cash Flow** -- Cash from operations exceeds net income due to non-cash depreciation add-back and working capital management. The $35.9M five-year operating cash flow provides substantial capacity for debt service, investor distributions, and reinvestment.

**Cumulative Position** -- The project is cash-flow positive on a net basis from Year 2 onward. By Year 5, cumulative net cash generation of $21.0M provides a strong foundation for potential distributions, expansion capital, or debt reduction.

## 7. Investment Returns

### Return on Investment

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Cumulative ROI** | 50% | 100% | 153% | 205% | 256% |

### Net Present Value Analysis

The project NPV is calculated under three discount rate assumptions reflecting different investor required return profiles.

| Discount Rate | NPV | Interpretation |
|---------------|-----|----------------|
| **10%** | **$11,638,848** | Institutional investor benchmark |

## 9. Notes & Methodology

### Model Construction

This five-year financial model was built bottom-up from unit economics (see Document 07: Unit Economics Model) and validated top-down against market comparables and industry benchmarks. Key methodological decisions include:

1. **Revenue recognition** -- Program revenue is recognized upon guest departure, consistent with service delivery completion
2. **Cost classification** -- Direct costs are those that vary with guest volume; operating expenses are fixed or semi-fixed costs that do not scale linearly with occupancy
3. **Cash flow timing** -- Operating cash flows assume 30-day collection cycles with deposits received at booking; investing outflows are front-loaded in Year 1
4. **Discount rates** -- NPV calculations use three rates (10%, 12%, 15%) spanning institutional to venture return expectations

### Limitations

- This model does not include revenue from bio-optimization add-on services, which represent potential upside not captured in the base case
- No second location or expansion revenue is modeled; all projections reflect single-site operations at the Riviera Maya Jungle Estate
- Currency risk (MXN/USD) is not explicitly modeled; operating costs incurred in MXN may benefit from favorable exchange rates
- Enterprise value and MOIC figures incorporate Year 5 exit valuation (EBITDA × 5.5x exit multiple + retained cash); see the Valuation Report for the full 9-method valuation framework and enterprise value bridge
