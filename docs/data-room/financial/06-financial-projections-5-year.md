## 1. Executive Summary Metrics

The Transformational Epicenter five-year financial model projects strong revenue generation and attractive investor returns driven by premium pricing, high gross margins, and a phased casita expansion strategy. The base case reflects a phased build-out from 15 to 60 casitas over five years, with occupancy ramping from 60% in Year 1 to 80% at stabilization, producing significant revenue growth as both capacity and occupancy increase simultaneously.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Project Cost** | **$16,823,500** |
| **Year 1 Revenue** | **$10,748,000** |
| **Year 5 Revenue** | **$35,461,000** |
| **5-Year Total Revenue** | **$125,880,000** |
| **Year 5 Enterprise Value (Base)** | **~$147,000,000** |
| **Project IRR (Base Case, with Exit)** | **78%** |
| **5-Year MOIC (incl. Exit)** | **7.5x** |

### Investment Highlights

- **High-margin revenue model** with 83% gross margins sustained across all five years, driven by premium pricing of $2,000/day and efficient direct cost structure
- **Phased expansion model** from 15 casitas at launch to 60 casitas by Year 5 -- expansion beyond Year 1 is funded entirely from operating cash flow, requiring no additional equity raise
- **Revenue grows 3.3x** from $10.7M (Year 1) to $35.5M (Year 5) as both capacity and occupancy increase
- **EBITDA margins expand** from 43% in Year 1 to 61% at maturity, demonstrating powerful operational leverage as fixed costs are spread across a growing revenue base
- **Defensible economics** supported by a break-even occupancy of ~3% (25 guests/year), providing an enormous safety margin

## 2. Key Investment Metrics - Scenario Analysis

Three scenarios model the range of expected outcomes based on occupancy rates, ramp timelines, and market conditions. All scenarios assume the same acquisition price, total project cost, and casita expansion phasing, varying only on occupancy assumptions.

| Metric | Base Case | Conservative | Aggressive |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Total Project Cost** | $16,823,500 | $16,823,500 | $16,823,500 |
| **Year 1 Revenue** | $10,748,000 | $8,553,000 | $11,867,000 |
| **Year 3 Revenue** | $27,426,000 | $21,839,000 | $30,281,000 |
| **Year 5 Revenue** | $35,461,000 | $28,237,000 | $39,153,000 |
| **5-Year Total Revenue** | $125,880,000 | $100,232,000 | $138,986,000 |
| **Year 5 Enterprise Value** | ~$147,000,000 | -- | -- |
| **Project IRR (with Exit)** | 78% | 66% | 87% |
| **5-Year MOIC (incl. Exit)** | 7.5x | 5.3x | 9.6x |

### Scenario Definitions

**Base Case** -- Assumes 60% occupancy in Year 1, ramping to 75% in Year 2, and stabilizing at 80% from Year 3 onward. Pricing holds at $2,000/day with the current program mix. Revenue includes program fees plus ancillary revenue from bio-optimization premium services and post-care subscriptions. Capacity expands from 15 to 60 casitas over five years. This scenario reflects management's best estimate of achievable performance given the property's location, competitive positioning, and planned marketing investment.

**Conservative Case** -- Assumes ~50-70% occupancy ramp with lower utilization in early years and more modest demand growth. This case models headwinds including slower brand awareness growth, regional competition, and potential macroeconomic softness in the luxury wellness segment. Even in this downside scenario, the project generates attractive returns with a 66% IRR and 5.3x MOIC over five years.

**Aggressive Case** -- Assumes ~70-85% occupancy ramp with faster market penetration and stronger demand. This case reflects a scenario where brand traction exceeds expectations, referral rates are high, and the Rancho Paraiso Oasis establishes itself rapidly as the category-defining facility. The aggressive case projects an 87% IRR and 9.6x MOIC.

## 3. Funding Allocation

Total project funding of $16,823,500 is allocated across seven categories, with the property acquisition representing the majority of the capital requirement.

| Category | Amount | % of Total | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Property Acquisition | $11,900,000 | 70.7% | $11.9M all-in acquisition price |
| Working Capital | $1,126,000 | 6.7% | Operating runway, initial inventory, deposits |
| Renovation & Conversion | $1,000,000 | 5.9% | Renovations to make property operational |
| Medical + Biohacking | $1,000,000 | 5.9% | ICU/monitoring, diagnostic, IV systems, biohacking equipment |
| Contingency | $847,500 | 5.0% | Risk buffer |
| Technology | $750,000 | 4.5% | Tech development |
| Pre-Opening | $200,000 | 1.2% | Licensing, staff training, soft launch |
| **TOTAL** | **$16,823,500** | **100%** | |

### Funding Allocation Commentary

**Property Acquisition (70.7%)** -- The single largest allocation covers the Rancho Paraiso Oasis acquisition at $11,900,000 all-in. The property's 45,000 m2 compound across 9 lots in Tulum, Q.R. provides the physical foundation for 60 treatment casitas with existing structural improvements that significantly reduce renovation scope compared to greenfield development.

**Working Capital (6.7%)** -- Operating runway covering initial inventory, deposits, and working capital needs through revenue ramp.

**Renovation & Conversion (5.9%)** -- Targeted renovations to prepare the existing compound for medical operations. The property's existing infrastructure reduces the scope of conversion work required, with the $1,000,000 budget covering essential medical and hospitality upgrades. Phase 2 expansion (15 additional casitas in Year 1) is included in the seed round; subsequent expansion is funded from cash flow.

**Medical + Biohacking (5.9%)** -- The $1,000,000 medical equipment investment covers ICU/monitoring systems, diagnostic equipment, IV therapy systems, pharmacy setup, and biohacking equipment for the bio-optimization center.

**Contingency (5.0%)** -- A 5.0% contingency reserve provides buffer for construction cost overruns, supply chain delays, and regulatory compliance costs.

---

## 4. 5-Year Capacity Model

The property follows a phased casita expansion from 15 at launch to 60 by Year 5. Expansion beyond Year 1 is funded entirely from operating cash flow at approximately $225,000 per casita (~$6.75M total). Occupancy ramps from 60% in Year 1 to 80% at stabilization, with effective average room count reflecting mid-year additions.

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | 5-Year Total |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Starting Casitas** | 15 | 30 | 40 | 48 | 54 | -- |
| **Added** | +15 | +10 | +8 | +6 | +6 | **+45** |
| **End-of-Year Casitas** | 30 | 40 | 48 | 54 | 60 | **60** |
| **Effective Avg Casitas** | 23 | 35 | 44 | 51 | 57 | -- |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 60% | 75% | 80% | 80% | 80% | -- |
| **Guests Served** | 387 | 737 | 988 | 1,145 | 1,280 | **4,537** |

### Capacity Assumptions

- **15 casitas at launch** with an additional 15 added during Year 1 (funded from the seed round), reaching 30 by year-end
- **Years 2-5 expansion** (30 to 60 casitas) is funded entirely from operating cash flow -- no additional equity raise required
- **Expansion cost** of ~$225,000 per casita, totaling ~$6.75M over Years 2-5
- **Average length of stay** of 13 days (weighted across the 7/14/21/28-day program mix)
- **Occupancy** is calculated as occupied bed-nights divided by available bed-nights, applied to the effective average casita count for each year
- **Guest count** is derived from effective average casitas × occupancy rate × 365 days / 13-day average stay
- **Year 1 occupancy of 60%** reflects a soft opening period and initial marketing ramp with 23 effective casitas
- **Stabilized occupancy of 80%** from Year 3 reflects management's view of sustainable utilization given the premium pricing tier and seasonal demand patterns in the Riviera Maya

| **Net Margin** | **26%** | **37%** | **39%** | **40%** | **40%** | **38%** |

### P&L Commentary

**Revenue Growth** -- Total revenue grows 3.3x from $10.7M in Year 1 to $35.5M by Year 5, driven by the dual engine of capacity expansion (15→60 casitas) and occupancy ramp (60%→80%). Revenue includes program fees, bio-optimization premium services (~30% upsell rate), and post-care subscriptions (~36% uptake). Pricing remains flat at $2,000/day across all years in the base case; no inflation or price increases are assumed, providing conservative upside optionality.

**Stable Gross Margins** -- Gross margins hold at 83% across all five years. Direct costs scale proportionally with guest volume at approximately $4,629 per guest, covering medical staff, facilitators, food & hospitality, bio-optimization supplies, plant medicine materials, and guest amenities.

**Operating Leverage** -- EBITDA margins expand from 43% in Year 1 to 61% by Year 5. The cost structure scales at approximately 1.6x for a 2x increase in capacity -- fixed costs (facilities, management, technology infrastructure) are spread across a much larger revenue base as the campus expands.

**Net Income** -- Five-year cumulative net income of $48.1M represents a 38% average net margin, demonstrating the capital efficiency of the operating model at scale.

## 6. Cash Flow Summary

| Line Item | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | 5-Year Total |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Cash from Operations** | $3,204,403 | $7,859,605 | $11,086,962 | $12,979,817 | $14,542,595 | **$49,673,382** |
| Expansion CapEx | $0 | ($2,250,000) | ($1,800,000) | ($1,350,000) | ($1,350,000) | ($6,750,000) |
| Maintenance & Equipment | $0 | ($400,000) | ($500,000) | ($600,000) | ($700,000) | ($2,200,000) |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **$3,204,403** | **$5,209,605** | **$8,786,962** | **$11,029,817** | **$12,492,595** | **$40,723,382** |

### Cash Flow Commentary

**Year 1 Cash Position** -- Year 1 generates $3.2M in free cash flow despite being the lowest-occupancy year. The initial $16.82M capital deployment is treated as the opening investment, with Year 1 representing the first year of operations. Expansion CapEx begins in Year 2 as the first phase-funded casitas come online.

**Expansion CapEx** -- The ($6.75M) in expansion capital expenditures over Years 2-5 funds the build-out from 30 to 60 casitas at approximately $225,000 per casita. This expansion is funded entirely from operating cash flow -- no additional equity raise is required.

**Maintenance CapEx** -- Annual maintenance capital of $400K-$700K (escalating as the facility grows) covers equipment replacement, facility upkeep, and technology upgrades.

**Cumulative Position** -- Five-year cumulative free cash flow of $40.7M represents 2.7x the initial investment, confirming strong cash generation after funding all expansion and maintenance needs. The initial $16.82M investment is fully recovered from cumulative free cash flow between Year 2 and Year 3 (approximately 2.7 years payback).

## 7. Investment Returns

### Return on Investment

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Cumulative ROI** | 17% | 64% | 132% | 212% | 302% |

### Net Present Value Analysis

The project NPV is calculated under three discount rate assumptions reflecting different investor required return profiles.

## 8. Key Assumptions

### Revenue Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source / Rationale |
|------------|-------|--------------------|
| Base daily rate | $2,000 | Market comparables; competitive pricing analysis |
| Weighted avg stay | 13 days | Program mix: 45% 7-day, 30% 14-day, 15% 21-day, 10% 28-day |
| Avg revenue per guest | $26,600 | Weighted average of program pricing |
| Year 1 occupancy | 60% | Assumes phased ramp with marketing investment |
| Year 2 occupancy | 75% | Reflects brand traction and referral momentum |
| Stabilized occupancy | 80% | Conservative vs. luxury hospitality benchmarks of 70-85% |
| Annual price escalation | 0% | Conservative; no price increases modeled in base case |

### Cost Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source / Rationale |
|------------|-------|--------------------|
| Direct cost per guest | $4,629 | Bottom-up build: medical, therapy, food, supplies, amenities |
| COGS ratio | ~17% | Direct costs as percentage of revenue |
| Year 1 OpEx | $4,206,000 | Fixed overhead: personnel, facilities, technology, marketing, G&A |
| OpEx escalation | ~4% annual | Standard operating cost inflation plus capacity scaling |
| Tax rate | 30% | Mexican corporate tax rate |
| Depreciation method | Straight-line | See D&A schedule below |

### Depreciation & Amortization Schedule

| Asset | Cost Basis | Annual D&A | Useful Life |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Renovation & Conversion | $1,000,000 | $66,667 | 15 years |
| Medical + Biohacking Equipment | $1,000,000 | $142,857 | 7 years |
| Technology Platform | $750,000 | $150,000 | 5 years |
| Property Improvements (allocated) | $2,376,190 | $277,619 | varies |
| Pre-opening Amortization | $200,000 | $40,000 | 5 years |
| **Total (Year 1 Base)** | | **$677,143** | -- |

Year 1 base D&A of $677,143 increases in subsequent years as casita expansion CapEx is placed in service and depreciated over 15 years:

| Year | Base D&A | Expansion D&A | Total D&A |
|------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Year 1 | $677,143 | $0 | $677,143 |
| Year 2 | $677,143 | $150,000 | $827,143 |

## 9. Notes & Methodology

### Model Construction

This five-year financial model was built bottom-up from unit economics (see Document 07: Unit Economics Model) and validated top-down against market comparables and industry benchmarks. The model incorporates a phased casita expansion strategy that distinguishes it from static capacity models. Key methodological decisions include:

1. **Revenue recognition** -- Program revenue is recognized upon guest departure, consistent with service delivery completion
2. **Cost classification** -- Direct costs (COGS) are those that vary with guest volume (~17% of revenue); operating expenses are fixed or semi-fixed costs that scale at approximately 1.6x for a 2x capacity increase
3. **Capacity phasing** -- Effective average casita count accounts for mid-year additions; guests are calculated from effective capacity × occupancy × 365 / 13-day avg stay
4. **Cash flow timing** -- Operating cash flows assume 30-day collection cycles with deposits received at booking; initial capital deployment occurs at Year 0
5. **Expansion funding** -- Year 2-5 casita additions are funded from operating cash flow at ~$225K/casita, with CapEx flowing through the investing section of the cash flow statement
6. **Discount rates** -- NPV calculations use three rates (10%, 12%, 15%) spanning institutional to venture return expectations

### Limitations

- Revenue includes bio-optimization premium services (~30% upsell rate) and post-care subscriptions (~36% uptake) as ancillary revenue streams alongside core program fees
- No second location or expansion revenue is modeled; all projections reflect single-site operations at the Rancho Paraiso Oasis
- The villa real estate opportunity (48 villas, $96M total sales) is not included in these healing center projections and represents significant additional upside
- Currency risk (MXN/USD) is not explicitly modeled; operating costs incurred in MXN may benefit from favorable exchange rates
- Enterprise value and MOIC figures incorporate Year 5 exit valuation; see the Valuation Report (Document 22) for the full 9-method valuation framework and enterprise value bridge
- No price escalation is modeled in the base case, providing conservative upside from inflation-based pricing adjustments
