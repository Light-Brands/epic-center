## Slide 1: Title

# TRANSFORMATIONAL EPICENTER

### Where Medicine Meets Transformation

**Confidential Investor Presentation**
February 2026

Riviera Maya Jungle Estate | Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico

invest@transformational-epicenter.com

---

## Slide 2: Vision

### Redefine what healing means for the world's highest achievers.

Transformational Epicenter is building the first medical-grade wellness facility that integrates clinical medicine, luxury hospitality, bio-optimization technology, and plant medicine into a single coordinated treatment system.

We do not compete in existing categories. We create the category.

**One facility. Four disciplines. Zero competitors at the intersection.**

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

### The treatment landscape is fragmented into four silos.

| Silo | What It Offers | What It Lacks |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Hospitals & Clinics** | Medical rigor, clinical safety | Hospitality, psychospiritual depth, continuity |
| **Luxury Resorts & Spas** | Exceptional experience, comfort | Medical outcomes, clinical protocols, evidence |
| **Biohacking & Longevity** | Technology, biomarkers, optimization | Psychospiritual dimension, trauma work |
| **Psychedelic Centers** | Transformational catalysts | Medical infrastructure, luxury, aftercare |

**Guests seeking comprehensive transformation must cobble together 3-4 providers across multiple countries, with no coordination between them.**

There is no single destination where a high-net-worth individual can receive medically supervised plant medicine, advanced bio-optimization, trauma integration therapy, and ultra-luxury hospitality as one unified program.

Until now.

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

### The only facility integrating all four pillars.

```
              MEDICAL RIGOR
                   |
    PLANT ----[ TE ]---- BIO-OPTIMIZATION
   MEDICINE        |
              LUXURY HOSPITALITY
```

**Transformational Epicenter is the convergence point.**

- Board-certified physicians, continuous cardiac telemetry, hospital-grade safety
- Ibogaine-assisted therapy, psilocybin protocols under full medical supervision
- Hyperbaric oxygen, IV NAD+, neurofeedback, pharmacogenomics, AI personalization
- Private jungle suites, chef-prepared nutrition, concierge-level service

Every guest receives all four pillars as a coordinated system, not a menu of disconnected services.

---

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

### $5.6 Trillion global wellness economy. Four converging segments.

| Market Segment | Current Size | CAGR | TE's Position |
|---------------|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Medical Tourism** | $48-94B | 16-18% | Premium medically supervised treatment abroad |
| **Wellness Tourism** | $850B-1.1T | 7-10% | Ultra-luxury outcome-driven programs |
| **Longevity Medicine** | $27-33B | 25-30% | Integrated bio-optimization protocols |
| **Psychedelic Therapy** | $3-5B | 15-20% | Most medically rigorous ibogaine facility |

**TE occupies the uncontested summit where all four markets intersect.**

No other operator can address all four segments simultaneously. Each would need to fundamentally rebuild to match TE's integrated model.

---

## Slide 6: Business Model

### Four tiered residential programs. One price architecture.

| Program | Duration | Price | ADR |
|---------|----------|-------|-----|
| **Reset** | 7 days | $14,000 | $2,000/night |
| **Interruption** | 14 days | $28,000 | $2,000/night |
| **Recalibration** | 21 days | $42,000 | $2,000/night |
| **Transformation** | 28 days | $56,000 | $2,000/night |

**Average Daily Rate: $2,000/night**

All programs include medical screening, physician oversight, plant medicine protocols, bio-optimization, integration therapy, luxury hospitality, and 12-month aftercare.

Longer programs deepen every dimension -- extended plant medicine sequences, additional bio-optimization cycles, more comprehensive trauma integration work.

---

## Slide 7: Unit Economics

### 83% gross margin at the guest level.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average Revenue per Guest** | $26,600 |
| **Average Direct Cost per Guest** | $4,629 |
| **Gross Profit per Guest** | $21,971 |
| **Gross Margin** | **83%** |

**Why margins are structurally high:**

- Premium pricing ($2,000/night ADR) driven by integration of all four pillars
- Medical and technology costs amortized across guest volume
- Plant medicine compound costs represent a small fraction of program fees
- Hospitality operating model proven at scale in luxury resort industry
- No intermediary distribution costs -- direct guest acquisition

---

## Slide 8a: Valuation

### Post-Money Valuation: $15,651,000

**IPEV-Compliant 9-Method Weighted Average**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Post-Money Valuation** | **$15,651,000** |
| **Valuation Range** | $11,610,000 - $20,905,000 |
| **Pre-Money Valuation** | $1,878,000 |

Nine independent valuation methods -- including Scorecard, Checklist, Cost Approach, Venture Capital (3 variants), Tiered Revenue VC, and DCF (2 variants) -- all produce positive valuations. The weighted average exceeds the $13.77M capital requirement, confirming the project creates immediate intrinsic value above its cost basis.

Full methodology detailed in the IPEV-Compliant Valuation Report (Document 22).

---

## Slide 8b: Exit Strategy

### Multiple pathways to liquidity with 6.69x base-case MOIC.

| Pathway | Timeline | Multiple | Probability |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Strategic Sale** (wellness/healthcare operator) | Year 5-7 | 6-10x EBITDA | Primary |
| **Private Equity Acquisition** | Year 4-6 | 5.5-8x EBITDA | Secondary |
| **Platform Expansion + Premium Exit** | Year 5-8 | 8-16x EBITDA | Highest Value |

**Enterprise Value Projections at Year 5:**

| Scenario | Enterprise Value |
|----------|-----------------|
| Conservative | $61,992,616 |
| **Base Case** | **$87,924,380** |
| Aggressive | $117,584,039 |

A single location commands 5.5-6.0x EBITDA at exit. Multi-location platform expansion could push multiples to 8-16x -- a critical value creation lever not captured in the base case.

## Slide 11: Competitive Landscape

### Gap matrix: No competitor integrates all four pillars.

| Capability | **TE** | SHA Wellness | Clinique La Prairie | Lanserhof | Beond |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| Medical Oversight | **Yes** | Partial | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| Plant Medicine | **Yes** | No | No | No | Yes |
| Bio-Optimization | **Yes** | Limited | Limited | Limited | No |
| Luxury Hospitality | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Moderate |
| Pre-Care Program | **Yes** | No | Limited | No | No |
| Post-Care (12-mo) | **Yes** | No | No | No | Limited |
| AI Personalization | **Yes** | No | No | No | No |
| Outcome Measurement | **Yes** | No | Limited | Limited | No |

**TE is the only "Yes" across every row.** This is not incremental differentiation. It is categorical.

---

## Slide 12: Our Moat

### Four structural advantages that compound over time.

**1. Integration Moat**
No competitor combines all four pillars. Replicating requires simultaneous capabilities in healthcare, psychedelic medicine, medical technology, and luxury hospitality -- disciplines that attract fundamentally different operators.

**2. Continuity Moat**
14-month guest relationship (pre-care through 12-month aftercare) creates superior outcomes, longitudinal data, and switching costs that episodic competitors cannot match.

**3. AI Personalization Moat**
Treatment protocols personalized using pharmacogenomic data, biomarkers, and machine learning. Growing dataset creates a data network effect that late entrants cannot replicate.

**4. Outcome-Anchored Pricing Moat**
Published clinical outcomes justify premium pricing and build institutional trust that undocumented competitors cannot match.

---

## Slide 13: Clinical Evidence

### Evidence-based protocols with measurable outcomes.

| Treatment Area | Protocol | Evidence Base | Expected Outcomes |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Addiction Interruption** | Ibogaine-assisted therapy | Brown & Alper (2018): 60-80% interruption rate | Opioid cessation, craving elimination within 48 hours |
| **Treatment-Resistant Depression** | Psilocybin + integration therapy | Davis et al. (2021): 71% response rate | Sustained mood improvement at 12-month follow-up |
| **Trauma Processing** | Plant medicine + somatic therapy | Noller et al. (2018): 75% improvement | PTSD symptom reduction, behavioral pattern change |
| **Neurological Recovery** | Bio-optimization suite | Published protocols for HBOT, NAD+, neurofeedback | Cognitive enhancement, neuroplasticity acceleration |

**TE's clinical differentiation:**

- CYP2D6 pharmacogenomic testing personalizes dosing for each guest
- Continuous cardiac telemetry during all plant medicine sessions
- 1:1 nursing ratio during acute treatment phases
- Standardized outcome measurement at baseline, discharge, and 30/90/180/365 days
- Outcome data collected and analyzed to continuously improve protocols

---

## Slide 14: Risk Factors

### Eight risk categories with active mitigations.

| Risk Category | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Regulatory | High | Multi-jurisdictional monitoring, diversified protocols, COFEPRIS counsel |
| Market / Demand | Medium | Conservative occupancy assumptions, tiered pricing, 83% margin buffer |
| Clinical | High | Hospital-grade protocols, continuous monitoring, malpractice insurance |
| Operational | Medium | Phased build-out, local expertise, conservative timeline |
| Competitive | Low-Medium | Category creation, integration moat, data network effect |
| Currency | Low | USD pricing, natural hedge, treasury management |
| Political / Country | Low-Medium | Established tourism corridor, corporate structure, insurance |
| Key Person | Medium | Documented SOPs, advisory board, institutional knowledge in platform |

---

## Slide 15: Timeline

### Phased 16-to-30-room build-out across 2026.

| Phase | Timeline | Milestone |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Q1 2026** | Months 1-3 | Entity formation, property acquisition, design finalization |
| **Q2 2026** | Months 4-6 | Phase 1 renovation (16 rooms), equipment procurement, COFEPRIS pre-consultation |
| **Q3 2026** | Months 7-9 | Phase 1 completion, staff hiring and training, regulatory approvals |
| **Q4 2026** | Months 10-12 | Soft launch with 16 rooms, first guest cohorts, operational refinement |
| **2027 H1** | Months 13-18 | Phase 2 expansion to 30 rooms, full marketing deployment |
| **2027 H2** | Months 19-24 | Steady-state 30-room operations, outcome data publication |

**Key principle:** Revenue generation begins with 16 rooms while Phase 2 construction proceeds. The business does not wait for full build-out to begin operating.
