## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**THIS DOCUMENT ESTABLISHES THE FRAMEWORK** for the Company's ongoing reporting obligations under its securities offerings. The Company is currently structured as a Regulation D offering, which has NO ongoing SEC reporting obligations. This document also provides a future-state reference framework for Regulation A+ Tier 2 continuous disclosure requirements, should the Company later pursue a Reg A+ offering.

**REG D CURRENT STATE:** Under Regulation D, the Company has no ongoing reporting obligations to the SEC beyond the initial Form D filing and annual amendments. The Company may voluntarily provide investor updates, but is not required to file periodic reports with the SEC.

**REG A+ FUTURE STATE:** If the Company later pursues a Regulation A+ Tier 2 offering and the Form 1-A is qualified by the SEC, the Company would become subject to continuous disclosure requirements as outlined in this document.
