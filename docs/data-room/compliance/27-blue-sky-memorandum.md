## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What Are Blue Sky Laws?

"Blue sky laws" are state-level securities regulations that exist alongside federal securities law. Every US state, the District of Columbia, and US territories have their own securities statutes. These laws regulate the offer and sale of securities within their jurisdictions.

### 1.2 Applicability to Transformational Epicenter

The Company is currently conducting a Reg D offering, with a potential future Reg A+ Tier 2 offering under consideration:

| Offering | Federal Exemption | Blue Sky Impact |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Reg D [To be determined -- LLC Membership Interests / Preferred Units / SAFE]** | Rule 506(b) or 506(c) [Pending counsel determination] | Federal preemption -- state registration NOT required, but notice filings ARE required |
| **Reg A+ Tier 2 (Future State)** | Regulation A, Tier 2 | Federal preemption -- state registration NOT required, but certain state requirements remain |

### 1.3 Key Principle

Both Rule 506 and Regulation A+ Tier 2 are "covered securities" under Section 18 of the Securities Act, which preempts state registration requirements. However, states retain:

- **Notice filing rights** (for Rule 506)
- **Anti-fraud enforcement authority** (for both)
- **Filing fee collection rights** (for both)
- **Limited qualification requirements** (for Reg A+ in certain states)

---

## 2. Federal Preemption Analysis

### 2.1 Rule 506 Preemption (NSMIA)

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) established that securities offered under Rule 506 are "covered securities" under Section 18(b)(4)(F) of the Securities Act.

**What this means for Transformational Epicenter:**

| State Authority | Preempted? | Detail |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| State registration/qualification of securities | **Yes -- preempted** | States cannot require registration of Rule 506 securities |
| State merit review of offering | **Yes -- preempted** | States cannot conduct substantive review of the offering |

| State filing fee | **No -- NOT preempted** | States may charge a notice filing fee |
| State anti-fraud enforcement | **No -- NOT preempted** | States retain full anti-fraud authority |
| State investigation authority | **No -- NOT preempted** | States can investigate suspected fraud |

### 2.2 Regulation A+ Tier 2 Preemption (JOBS Act)

Title IV of the JOBS Act (2012) and SEC Rule 256 established that Regulation A+ Tier 2 securities are "covered securities" under Section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act.

**What this means for Transformational Epicenter:**

| State Authority | Preempted? | Detail |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| State registration/qualification | **Yes -- preempted** | States cannot require registration of Tier 2 securities |
| State merit review | **Yes -- preempted** | States cannot conduct substantive review |
| State notice filing requirement | **Limited** | States may require notice filing (Form 1-A or equivalent) |
| State filing fee | **Limited** | States may charge filing fees |
| State anti-fraud enforcement | **No -- NOT preempted** | States retain full anti-fraud authority |

## 3. Reg D State Filing Requirements

### 3.1 Form D Notice Filing

Under Section 18(b)(4)(F) of the Securities Act and corresponding state laws, most states require issuers to file a notice (typically a copy of SEC Form D) and pay a fee when selling Rule 506 securities to residents of that state.

### 3.2 Timing

| Jurisdiction | Filing Deadline | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **SEC (federal)** | Within 15 days after first sale | File Form D electronically on EDGAR |
| **Most states** | Within 15 days after first sale to a state resident | File state notice form + Form D copy |
| **Some states** | Prior to first sale | A few states require pre-sale filing |

### 3.3 Key State Requirements

**Notice Filing States (most states):**

States that accept Form D and a fee as the sole notice filing requirement. This is the majority of states.

## 4. Reg A+ Tier 2 State Requirements

### 4.1 Federal Preemption Benefits

Reg A+ Tier 2 provides significant advantages over Tier 1 for blue sky compliance:

| Feature | Tier 1 | Tier 2 |
|---------|--------|--------|

| State merit review | **Yes** -- states may review | **No** -- preempted |
| State notice filing | Varies by state | Some states require notice |
| Maximum offering | $20 million | $75 million |
| Financial statements | Reviewed | Audited (PCAOB-registered) |
| Ongoing reporting | None | Form 1-K, 1-SA, 1-U |

### 4.2 State Notice Requirements for Tier 2

While state registration is preempted, NASAA (North American Securities Administrators Association) has developed a coordinated review program. Some states may still require:

- Notice filing of Form 1-A
- Filing fee payment
- Consent to service of process

### 4.3 NASAA Coordinated Review

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Filing system** | Electronic Filing Depository (EFD) |
| **Lead examiner** | State where issuer's principal office is located (Delaware) |
| **Filing requirement** | File Form 1-A and all exhibits with each state where securities will be offered |
| **Fee** | Varies by state ($0 - $1,000+) |
| **Timeline** | Typically 1-3 weeks for processing |

## 6. State-by-State Analysis

| [State 2] | [TBD] | [TBD] | Pending | Pending | -- |

## 9. International Operations & Psychedelic Medicine Considerations

### 9.1 Industry-Specific State Concerns

The Company operates a medical wellness facility in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico, offering ibogaine-assisted therapy, luxury hospitality, bio-optimization, and psychedelic medicine programs. This creates additional blue sky considerations that differ significantly from a purely domestic issuer:

| Consideration | Detail | Impact |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| **Mexico-based operations** | The Company's primary operations and revenue-generating facility are located in Mexico, not the United States | State securities regulators may apply heightened scrutiny to an issuer whose operations are outside US jurisdiction; additional risk disclosures required in offering materials |
| **Psychedelic substance classification** | Ibogaine is unregulated in Mexico, allowing lawful medical administration; however, ibogaine is classified as Schedule I under the US Controlled Substances Act | State securities regulators may scrutinize offerings by companies whose core service involves a substance that is federally controlled in the US, even though operations occur in a jurisdiction where it is lawful |
| **Medical tourism regulatory framework** | Cross-border healthcare services create unique regulatory considerations spanning two national jurisdictions | Risk disclosures must address the regulatory gap between US and Mexican healthcare regulation, patient liability, and cross-border medical malpractice considerations |
| **FATCA & FBAR reporting** | US investors in a company operating from Mexico may trigger Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting obligations and Foreign Bank Account Reports (FBAR) depending on structure | Offering materials should disclose any additional US investor tax reporting obligations arising from the Company's Mexico-based operations |
| **Currency & repatriation risk** | The Company may earn revenue in both US dollars and Mexican pesos, and must be able to repatriate funds | State regulators and investors will want clarity on currency risk management and fund repatriation procedures |
| **Political & sovereign risk** | Operating in a foreign jurisdiction introduces sovereign risk, regulatory change risk, and political stability considerations | Standard risk factor disclosure; does not create specific blue sky filing obligations but informs materiality determinations |

### 9.2 States with Heightened Scrutiny for International and Psychedelic-Adjacent Offerings

| State | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| **California** | DFPI may apply additional scrutiny to offerings involving psychedelic or controlled substances, even where operations are lawful in the operating jurisdiction; large medical tourism investor market |
| **New York** | NYAG has historically been active in scrutinizing cross-border investment offerings; high-net-worth investor concentration |
| **Texas** | State Securities Board may have additional requirements for issuers with operations outside the US; proximity to Mexico border creates strong medical tourism investor interest |
| **Florida** | OFR may scrutinize international operations; significant medical tourism and wellness investor base |
| **Arizona** | Border state with strong medical tourism corridor to Mexico; state regulators may have specific interest in cross-border healthcare offerings |
| **Colorado** | Progressive psychedelic policy (natural medicine legalization); investors may be well-informed but regulators remain attentive |
| **Nevada** | Wellness and hospitality investor market; regulators experienced with hospitality offerings |
| **Massachusetts** | Major psychedelic research hub (Johns Hopkins, MAPS-affiliated institutions); sophisticated investor base but active securities regulator |

### 9.3 Mitigation Strategy

The Company's positioning as a **medical wellness and luxury hospitality company** operating lawfully in Mexico is the primary mitigation:

- The Company operates exclusively in Mexico, where ibogaine is unregulated and its medical administration is lawful
- The Company does not manufacture, distribute, import, or sell controlled substances in the United States
- The Company's services integrate clinical medicine, luxury hospitality, bio-optimization, and plant medicine under licensed medical supervision
- All medical protocols are overseen by Dr. Mariana Hoyo (Chief Medical Advisor) and comply with applicable Mexican healthcare regulations
- Risk disclosures in the PPM comprehensively address the regulatory distinction between US and Mexican classification of ibogaine
- The Company's four-discipline model (clinical medicine, luxury hospitality, bio-optimization, plant medicine) diversifies revenue risk beyond any single psychedelic modality
- FATCA, FBAR, and cross-border tax implications are disclosed to prospective US investors

### 9.4 Priority Filing State Rationale

The priority filing states for Transformational Epicenter reflect the intersection of high-net-worth investor markets and wellness/medical tourism demand corridors:

| State | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| **California** | Largest wellness market in the US; significant medical tourism demand; high-net-worth investor concentration; psychedelic-forward culture |
| **New York** | Financial capital; highest concentration of accredited investors; growing psychedelic medicine investment community |
| **Texas** | Proximity to Mexico border creates natural medical tourism corridor; large investor market; strong wellness economy |
| **Florida** | Major longevity and wellness hub (Miami, Palm Beach); medical tourism gateway; high-net-worth retirement community |
| **Nevada** | Hospitality/luxury investor base; wellness tourism corridor (Las Vegas); favorable business climate |
| **Arizona** | Border state medical tourism corridor; wellness/longevity community (Scottsdale, Sedona); high-net-worth retiree market |
| **Colorado** | Psychedelic policy leadership (natural medicine legalization); health-conscious investor demographic; wellness economy hub |
| **Connecticut** | Highest per-capita income state; hedge fund corridor; high-net-worth investor concentration |
| **Massachusetts** | Psychedelic research leadership; biotech/medical investor base; high-net-worth market |
| **New Jersey** | High-net-worth investor market; proximity to NYC financial center; medical/pharmaceutical investor base |
