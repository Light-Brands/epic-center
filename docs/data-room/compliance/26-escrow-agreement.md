## 1. Purpose & Context

### 1.1 Overview

Escrow arrangements serve as investor protection mechanisms, ensuring that investor funds are held by an independent third party until specified conditions are met. For the Company's securities offerings, escrow provides:

- **Investor confidence** -- Funds are protected by an independent fiduciary
- **Regulatory compliance** -- Required or recommended for Reg D offerings with minimum raise thresholds
- **Operational integrity** -- Clear conditions for fund release prevent premature use of proceeds
- **Minimum raise protection** -- If a minimum raise threshold is not met, funds are returned to investors

### 1.2 Offering Context

| Offering | Escrow Application |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Reg D [To be determined -- LLC Membership Interests / Preferred Units / SAFE]** | Recommended -- Company may use escrow for subscriptions or operate on a rolling close basis, per counsel determination |

### 1.3 Regulatory Basis

- **Rule 15c2-4** (Securities Exchange Act) -- Requires broker-dealers to transmit investor funds to an escrow agent if the offering has a minimum contingency
- **Broker-dealer compliance requirements** -- [To be designated] broker-dealer may require escrow as a condition of engagement

## 7. Cross-Border Considerations

### 7.1 International Fund Disbursement

The Company's operations are based in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico. The following cross-border considerations apply to the escrow arrangement:

| Consideration | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Currency** | All investor subscriptions and escrow deposits will be denominated in USD |
| **Disbursement to Mexico** | If offering proceeds are disbursed to Mexico-based accounts for operations, international wire transfer compliance requirements apply |
| **OFAC compliance** | All disbursements must be screened for OFAC compliance, including Mexico as a destination |
| **FinCEN reporting** | International wire transfers may trigger additional FinCEN reporting requirements |
| **Mexico banking regulations** | Funds received in Mexico may be subject to Mexican anti-money laundering regulations (LFPIORPI) |
| **Tax withholding** | Cross-border fund flows may trigger withholding obligations; consult tax counsel |

### 7.2 Multi-Currency Considerations

### 7.3 Recommended Practices
