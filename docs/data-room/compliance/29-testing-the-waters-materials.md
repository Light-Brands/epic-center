## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**THIS DOCUMENT ESTABLISHES THE FRAMEWORK** for "Testing the Waters" (TTW) materials and procedures for Transformational Epicenter Holdings, LLC (the "Company") in connection with a potential future Regulation A+ Tier 2 offering.

**CURRENT STATE:** The Company is currently structured as a Regulation D offering. Testing the Waters under Rule 255 applies **only** to Regulation A+ offerings. This document is a future-state framework that would apply if the Company later pursues a Reg A+ offering.

**REG A+ APPLICABILITY:** Section 5(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by Section 401(a) of the JOBS Act, permits Regulation A issuers to "test the waters" with potential investors before and during the SEC qualification process. This TTW framework is not applicable to the Company's current Reg D offering.

## 1. Legal Framework

### 1.1 Statutory Basis

**Section 5(a) of the Securities Act** generally prohibits offers to sell securities before a registration statement is filed. However, **Section 401(a) of the JOBS Act** created a specific exemption for Regulation A issuers:

> An issuer may "test the waters" to determine whether there is any interest in a contemplated securities offering by communicating with potential investors prior to or following the filing of an offering statement, provided that any written communication or broadcast includes the required legends.

**Note:** This TTW framework applies only to Regulation A+ offerings. The Company's current Reg D offering does not use or require TTW procedures. This document is preserved as a future-state framework.

### 1.2 SEC Rule 255

Rule 255 of Regulation A codifies the TTW provisions:

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **When** | Before or after filing Form 1-A (before qualification) |
| **Who** | Issuer directly, or through authorized agents |
| **What** | Written or oral communications to gauge investor interest |
| **Restrictions** | Must include required disclaimer; no money may be solicited or accepted |
| **Broker-dealer** | [To be designated] may assist with TTW distribution |

### 1.3 Key Limitations
