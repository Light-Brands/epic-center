## 5. RENOVATION BUDGET BREAKDOWN

### 5.1 Renovation Line Items

The $1,000,000 renovation budget covers essential modifications to prepare the existing compound for medical operations. The property's existing infrastructure reduces the scope of conversion work required compared to greenfield development.

| # | Category | Estimated Amount | Notes |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Medical infrastructure upgrades | $400,000 | ICU-grade electrical, plumbing, HVAC for treatment rooms |

| | **TOTAL RENOVATION** | **$1,000,000** | |

### 5.2 Renovation Strategy

The renovation converts an undeveloped jungle estate into a medical-grade wellness facility while preserving the natural environment that is central to the healing experience. Key design principles:

- **Medical-first infrastructure:** All systems designed to support ICU-grade operations
- **Nature integration:** Treatment spaces incorporate jungle views and natural ventilation
- **Phased execution:** 15 casitas in Year 1, scaling to 60 casitas by Year 5 (15→30→40→48→54→60)
- **Sustainable design:** Solar supplementation, rainwater harvesting, low-impact construction techniques
