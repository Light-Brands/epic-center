## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Riviera Maya Jungle Estate requires a **$4,050,000 renovation** to convert the undeveloped jungle compound into a fully operational medical wellness facility capable of serving up to 60 guests at full build-out across 7-to-28-day treatment programs, with casitas phased from 15 to 60 over 5 years. The renovation scope encompasses medical infrastructure, treatment spaces, guest amenities, staff facilities, and critical life-safety systems.

### Budget at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Renovation Budget** | $4,050,000 |
| **Contingency (15%)** | $847,500 |
| **Total with Contingency** | $4,897,500 |
| **Number of Line Items** | 10 categories |
| **Year 1 Casitas** | 15→30 (23 effective rooms) |
| **Full Build Casitas** | 60 (phased 15→30→40→48→54→60 over 5 years) |
| **Phase 1 Construction** | Core medical + first 15 casitas |

### Design Philosophy

The renovation transforms a vacant jungle estate into a medical-grade wellness facility while preserving the natural environment that is essential to the healing experience. Every design decision balances three priorities:

1. **Medical capability** -- ICU-grade systems, emergency response, pharmaceutical storage
2. **Guest experience** -- Luxury wellness aesthetic, natural materials, jungle integration
3. **Operational efficiency** -- Staff flow, supply logistics, maintenance access

## 3. PHASED BUILD-OUT STRATEGY

### 3.1 Phase 1: Core Operations (Months 1-6)

**Objective:** Open with 15 operational casitas and core medical/treatment capability.

| Component | Status at Phase 1 End | Investment |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Medical Suite | Fully operational | $750,000 |
| Treatment/Ceremony Rooms | 3 rooms operational | $500,000 |
| Commercial Kitchen | Fully operational | $500,000 |
| Guest Bathrooms | 15 casita bathrooms upgraded | $457,000 |
| Staff Quarters | Operational for Phase 1 staff | $200,000 |
| Generator/Backup Power | Fully operational | $200,000 |
| Helipad | Operational | $0 |
| **Phase 1 Total** | **15 casitas open** | **$2,607,000** |

**Phase 1 Milestones:**
- Month 1-2: Site preparation, utility connections, generator installation
- Month 2-4: Medical suite construction, kitchen renovation, staff quarters
- Month 3-5: Treatment room build-out, first bathroom upgrades
- Month 5-6: Equipment installation, systems testing, staff training
- Month 6: Soft opening with 15 casitas

### 3.2 Phase 2: Expansion to 30 Casitas (Months 7-12)

**Objective:** Expand to 30 casitas with complete bio-optimization center and remaining amenities.

| Component | Status at Phase 2 End | Investment |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Bio-optimization Center | Fully operational | $750,000 |
| Additional Casita Bathrooms | 30 casitas total upgraded | $143,000 |
| Group/Integration Spaces | Fully operational | $250,000 |
| Outdoor Treatment Areas | Fully operational | $250,000 |
| Staff Quarters | Expanded for full team | $50,000 |
| **Phase 2 Total** | **30 casitas open** | **$1,443,000** |

**Phase 2 Milestones:**
- Month 7-9: Bio-optimization center construction begins (longest lead time)
- Month 7-8: Additional casita bathroom upgrades
- Month 8-10: Group spaces and outdoor treatment areas
- Month 10-12: Bio-optimization equipment installation and calibration
- Month 12: 30-casita capacity operational (further expansion to 60 casitas phased over Years 2-5)

### 3.3 Phasing Rationale

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Revenue from Month 7** | Phase 1 opens with 15 casitas generating revenue while Phase 2 completes |
| **Reduced capital risk** | 64% of renovation ($2.6M) deployed before any revenue; remaining 36% funded partially by operations |
| **Market validation** | 6 months of operations inform Phase 2 and subsequent expansion decisions |
| **Staff ramp** | Allows team to build competency at 15-casita scale before expanding to 30 and beyond |
| **Construction isolation** | Phase 2 work occurs in separate zones from operating guest areas |

```

### 4.2 Critical Path Items

| Item | Duration | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Medical Suite | 4-5 months | Site prep complete, utility connections | HIGH - Must complete before soft opening |
| Generator Installation | 2 months | None (can begin immediately) | MEDIUM - Required for all medical operations |
| Bio-optimization Center | 5-6 months | Phase 1 areas cleared | MEDIUM - Longest Phase 2 item |
| Treatment Rooms | 3-4 months | Structural walls, utility rough-in | HIGH - Core revenue-generating spaces |
| Commercial Kitchen | 2-3 months | Utility connections, ventilation | HIGH - Required for guest operations |
| Equipment Procurement | Ongoing | Orders placed Month 1-2 | HIGH - Long lead times for medical/hyperbaric equipment |

### 4.3 Seasonal Considerations

| Factor | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Rainy season (June-October) | Delays outdoor work, access challenges | Phase 1 focuses on enclosed structures; outdoor work scheduled for dry months |
| Hurricane season (June-November) | Potential multi-day work stoppages | Construction insurance, emergency tarps, reinforced temporary structures |
| Holiday periods (Dec/Jan, Easter) | Reduced labor availability | Project schedule accounts for 2-week holiday buffer |
| Peak tourism (Nov-April) | Increased material costs, labor competition | Pre-purchase bulk materials, lock contractor rates in advance |
