## 1. Executive Summary

Transformational Epicenter operates through a three-entity corporate structure designed to maximize investor protection, optimize international tax treatment, and comply with both U.S. and Mexican regulatory requirements. The structure separates the U.S. holding company from Mexican operating entities, providing liability insulation between real estate holdings and healthcare operations while enabling efficient capital flows between jurisdictions.

**Structure at a Glance:**

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Transformational Epicenter Holdings, LLC | Delaware, USA | Parent holding company; investor entry point |
| TE Operations Mexico, S.A. de C.V. | Quintana Roo, Mexico | Operating entity for medical wellness facility |
| TE Real Estate Mexico, S.A. de C.V. | Quintana Roo, Mexico | Real estate holding via fideicomiso bank trust |

This structure follows established best practices for U.S.-based companies operating medical and hospitality facilities in Mexico's restricted coastal zone. The Delaware holding company serves as the single point of investment for U.S. and international investors, while the Mexican subsidiaries handle day-to-day operations and real estate ownership in compliance with Mexico's Foreign Investment Law and Constitutional restrictions on coastal property ownership by foreign entities.

**Capital Flow:** U.S. investors contribute capital to the Delaware holding company, which capitalizes the Mexican subsidiaries through equity contributions and/or intercompany loans. Operating revenues flow from TE Operations Mexico back to the holding company as dividends, management fees, or loan repayments, subject to applicable withholding taxes and transfer pricing regulations.

## 6. Key Legal Considerations

### 6.1 Ibogaine Legal Status in Mexico

Ibogaine is **not a controlled substance** in Mexico. It is not listed in any of the schedules under Mexico's General Health Law (Ley General de Salud) or its implementing regulations. This legal status permits the administration of ibogaine in a medical setting with proper healthcare facility licensing. Multiple clinics currently operate in Mexico providing ibogaine-assisted treatment.

However, ibogaine remains a Schedule I substance in the United States. This distinction requires careful structuring to ensure:

- No ibogaine is transported across the U.S.-Mexico border
- U.S. marketing materials comply with FDA advertising regulations
- Guest consent forms clearly disclose the substance's U.S. legal status
- The corporate structure does not create U.S. liability for Mexican medical activities

### 6.2 Liability Protection

The three-entity structure provides multiple layers of liability protection:

- **Entity Separation:** Operating entity risks are isolated from real estate assets
- **Holding Company Shield:** U.S. investors hold interests in the Delaware LLC, not directly in Mexican entities
- **Insurance Program:** Comprehensive coverage including medical malpractice, general liability, D&O, and professional liability
- **Mexican Corporate Veil:** S.A. de C.V. structure provides limited liability under Mexican law
- **Fideicomiso Protection:** Bank trust structure adds additional separation for real estate assets

### 6.3 Investment Documents

The following investment documents will be prepared and reviewed by legal counsel:

- **Operating Agreement** -- Governance, capital, distributions, exits
- **Subscription Agreement** -- Terms of investment, representations, and warranties
- **Investor Rights Agreement** -- Information rights, board rights, protective provisions
- **SAFE or Series Seed Preferred** -- Investment instrument (to be determined based on round structure)
- **Side Letters** -- Any investor-specific terms or accommodations
