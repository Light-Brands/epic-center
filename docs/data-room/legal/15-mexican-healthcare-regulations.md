## 1. Executive Summary

Mexico's healthcare regulatory framework is governed by a multi-layered system of federal, state, and municipal authorities. For Transformational Epicenter, operating a medical wellness facility in Quintana Roo's Riviera Maya region requires compliance with healthcare licensing, medical personnel standards, pharmaceutical regulations, patient safety requirements, and international data protection obligations.

The regulatory landscape presents both opportunities and obligations. Mexico permits the medical use of ibogaine (unscheduled substance), allows 100% foreign investment in healthcare operations, and has a well-defined pathway for facility licensing through COFEPRIS (Mexico's equivalent of the U.S. FDA). At the same time, compliance requires rigorous facility standards, qualified Mexican-licensed medical personnel, and adherence to Official Mexican Standards (NOMs) that govern every aspect of clinical operations.

**Key Regulatory Highlights:**

| Area | Authority | Status for TE |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Healthcare Facility License | COFEPRIS / State Health | Required; application planned |
| Ibogaine Administration | Not controlled | Legal; medical oversight required |
| Medical Personnel | SEP / CONACEM | Mexican-licensed physicians required |
| Patient Data Protection | INAI / LFPDPPP | Privacy compliance program required |
| Foreign Investment | Ministry of Economy | 100% foreign ownership permitted in healthcare |
| Environmental | SEMARNAT | Assessment may be required for facility modifications |

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Mexico's healthcare regulatory framework as it applies to Transformational Epicenter's planned operations. It is intended as an investor reference and will be supplemented by formal legal opinions from retained Mexican healthcare counsel.

## 2. COFEPRIS Overview

### 2.1 What is COFEPRIS

**COFEPRIS** (Comision Federal para la Proteccion contra Riesgos Sanitarios) is the Federal Commission for Protection against Sanitary Risks. It is Mexico's primary regulatory authority for healthcare facilities, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and public health. COFEPRIS functions analogously to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), though its regulatory scope also encompasses facility licensing functions that in the United States are typically handled by state health departments.

**Official Name:** Comision Federal para la Proteccion contra Riesgos Sanitarios
**Parent Ministry:** Secretaria de Salud (SSA) -- Ministry of Health
**Headquarters:** Mexico City
**Regional Offices:** All 32 Mexican states, including Quintana Roo

### 2.2 COFEPRIS Regulatory Authority

COFEPRIS has regulatory jurisdiction over the following areas relevant to Transformational Epicenter:

- **Pharmaceutical Products** -- Registration, importation, and distribution of medications
- **Medical Devices** -- Equipment registration and importation permits
- **Clinical Research** -- Authorization for clinical trials and experimental protocols
- **Food Safety** -- Licensing for food preparation and service within healthcare facilities
- **Advertising** -- Regulation of health-related advertising and marketing claims
- **Pharmacovigilance** -- Adverse event reporting and medication safety monitoring

### 2.3 Governing Legislation

COFEPRIS derives its authority from the following primary legislation:

## 5. Ibogaine Legal Status in Mexico

### 5.1 Regulatory Classification

Ibogaine (12-methoxyibogamine) is **not listed** in any of the schedules under Mexico's General Health Law (Ley General de Salud) or its implementing regulations. Specifically:

- **Not in Table I** (narcotics with no medical use)
- **Not in Table II** (narcotics with some medical use)
- **Not in Table III** (psychotropics)
- **Not in Table IV** (limited psychotropics)
- **Not in Table V** (pharmaceutical preparations)

### 5.2 Practical Implications

Because ibogaine is unscheduled in Mexico:

- No specific COFEPRIS permit is required for the substance itself
- No controlled substance license is needed for ibogaine possession or administration
- No special storage or security requirements beyond standard pharmaceutical practices
- No mandatory reporting to controlled substance registries
- Administration is legal when conducted under appropriate medical supervision

### 5.3 Medical Use Framework

While ibogaine itself is not regulated as a controlled substance, its **medical administration** falls under the general healthcare regulatory framework:

- Must be administered in a licensed healthcare facility
- Must be supervised by a qualified, licensed physician
- Patient must provide informed consent (see Section 10)
- Adverse events must be reported under pharmacovigilance requirements (NOM-220-SSA1-2016)
- Medical records must be maintained per NOM-004-SSA3-2012

### 5.4 Known Risks and Medical Requirements

Ibogaine carries known cardiac risks (QT prolongation) that require:

- Pre-treatment cardiac screening (ECG/EKG)
- Assessment of contraindicated medications and conditions
- Continuous cardiac monitoring during administration
- 24/7 physician availability during treatment window
- Emergency cardiac response capability (defibrillator, ACLS medications)
- Strict exclusion criteria for cardiac risk factors

### 5.5 Comparison with Other Jurisdictions

| Jurisdiction | Ibogaine Status |
|-------------|----------------|
| Mexico | Unscheduled; legal for medical use |
| United States | Schedule I controlled substance; prohibited |
| Canada | Unscheduled; available through Special Access Programme |
| Brazil | Unscheduled; legal |
| New Zealand | Prescription medicine (regulated) |
| European Union | Varies by country; prohibited in several member states |
| Australia | Prohibited (Schedule 9) |

### 5.6 Regulatory Monitoring

Given evolving international attitudes toward psychedelic substances, Transformational Epicenter will maintain an active regulatory monitoring program:

- Track all legislative proposals in the Mexican Congress relating to psychedelic substances
- Monitor COFEPRIS guidance and regulatory actions
- Engage with industry organizations (e.g., Global Ibogaine Therapy Alliance)
- Retain psychedelic policy counsel for ongoing jurisdiction monitoring
- Maintain contingency plans for potential regulatory changes

## 16. Data Protection (LFPDPPP)

### 16.1 Mexico's Data Privacy Law

The Ley Federal de Proteccion de Datos Personales en Posesion de los Particulares (LFPDPPP) is Mexico's federal data protection law. It applies to all private entities processing personal data in Mexico, including healthcare facilities.

### 16.2 Key Obligations

| Obligation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Privacy Notice (Aviso de Privacidad) | Written notice to all data subjects describing data collection, use, and sharing |
| Consent | Explicit consent required for processing sensitive data (health information) |
| Data Security | Technical, administrative, and physical safeguards for personal data |
| Data Subject Rights (ARCO) | Access, Rectification, Cancellation, and Opposition rights |
| Data Transfer | Cross-border transfer requires adequate protections |
| Breach Notification | Notify data subjects of security breaches affecting their data |

### 16.3 Healthcare Data Classification

Patient health data is classified as **sensitive personal data** under LFPDPPP, requiring:

- Express written consent for collection and processing
- Heightened security measures
- Restricted access on a need-to-know basis
- Encryption for storage and transmission

### 16.4 Cross-Border Data Considerations

Transformational Epicenter will process data of international guests (primarily U.S. residents), requiring:

- **LFPDPPP Compliance** -- Mexican data protection for all data processed in Mexico
- **HIPAA Awareness** -- While HIPAA does not directly apply to Mexican entities, U.S. guests expect HIPAA-equivalent protections; implementing HIPAA-aligned practices builds trust and facilitates referral relationships with U.S. providers
- **Cross-Border Transfer Safeguards** -- Data transferred between Mexico and the United States must comply with LFPDPPP transfer requirements (adequate protections, consent, contractual safeguards)

### 16.5 INAI Oversight

The Instituto Nacional de Transparencia, Acceso a la Informacion y Proteccion de Datos Personales (INAI) is the regulatory authority overseeing LFPDPPP compliance. Enforcement actions can include fines, corrective measures, and public sanctions.
