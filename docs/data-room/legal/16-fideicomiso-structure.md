## 1. Document Overview

This document explains the fideicomiso (bank trust) structure that Transformational Epicenter will use to hold real estate in Mexico's restricted coastal zone. The fideicomiso is a well-established and legally required mechanism that enables foreign-owned entities to acquire, hold, and develop real property in areas where the Mexican Constitution prohibits direct foreign ownership.

Understanding the fideicomiso is essential for investors evaluating Transformational Epicenter because the Rancho Paraiso Oasis -- the company's planned primary facility location in Tulum, Quintana Roo -- is located within the constitutionally restricted zone. This document details the legal basis, structure, costs, rights, and risks associated with this arrangement.

## 2. What is a Fideicomiso

### 2.1 Definition

A fideicomiso is a Mexican bank trust in which a Mexican banking institution holds legal title to real property on behalf of a foreign beneficiary. The trust arrangement is authorized under Mexico's Foreign Investment Law (Ley de Inversion Extranjera) and regulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores, SRE).

The fideicomiso has been in use in Mexico since constitutional reforms in 1973 and was further codified in the 1993 Foreign Investment Law. It is the standard, accepted, and legally sanctioned method by which foreign individuals and entities own real property in Mexico's restricted zone.

### 2.2 Legal Basis

| Legislation | Relevance |
|-------------|-----------|
| Mexican Constitution, Article 27, Section I | Establishes the restricted zone (50km coast, 100km border) |
| Ley de Inversion Extranjera (Foreign Investment Law), Articles 10-11 | Authorizes fideicomiso trusts for foreign ownership in restricted zone |
| Ley de Instituciones de Credito (Banking Law) | Governs bank trust operations |
| Ley General de Titulos y Operaciones de Credito | Trust deed requirements |
| SRE Regulations | Permit process for fideicomiso establishment |

### 2.3 How It Works

The fideicomiso operates through a three-party arrangement:

- **Settlor (Fideicomitente):** The property seller, who transfers title into the trust
- **Trustee (Fiduciario):** A Mexican bank authorized to act as trustee, which holds legal title
- **Beneficiary (Fideicomisario):** The foreign entity or individual who enjoys all rights of ownership

The trustee bank holds "bare legal title" only. The beneficiary retains all beneficial ownership rights, including the right to use, occupy, lease, develop, sell, mortgage, and bequeath the property. The bank trustee acts only on instructions from the beneficiary and has no independent decision-making authority regarding the property.

---

## 3. Why a Fideicomiso is Required

### 3.1 Constitutional Restriction

Article 27, Section I of the Mexican Constitution establishes the "restricted zone" (zona restringida):

> Foreign nationals may not acquire direct ownership of land or water within a strip of 100 kilometers along the borders and 50 kilometers along the coastlines.

### 3.2 Application to Transformational Epicenter

The Rancho Paraiso Oasis in Tulum, Quintana Roo, is located within the 50-kilometer coastal restricted zone. As a property owned (beneficially) by a foreign entity (TE Real Estate Mexico, S.A. de C.V., which is in turn owned by the Delaware holding company), a fideicomiso is the legally required vehicle for property ownership.

### 3.3 Restricted Zone Map Reference

            restricted zone)
```

All current and contemplated property locations in Quintana Roo's Riviera Maya corridor fall within the restricted zone, making the fideicomiso structure mandatory.

## 7. Costs

### 7.1 Setup Costs

| Cost Component | Estimated Amount |
|---------------|-----------------|
| SRE permit application fee | $500 - $1,000 USD |
| Bank trustee setup fee | $2,000 - $3,500 USD |
| Notarial fees (trust deed execution) | $2,000 - $4,000 USD |
| Legal counsel fees (trust negotiation) | $2,000 - $3,000 USD |
| Public Registry registration fee | $500 - $1,000 USD |
| Miscellaneous (translations, apostilles, etc.) | $500 - $1,000 USD |
| **Total Estimated Setup Cost** | **$7,500 - $13,500 USD** |

*Note: Costs vary depending on property value, selected bank, and complexity of transaction. Midpoint estimate: approximately $8,000 - $10,000 USD.*

### 7.2 Ongoing Annual Costs

| Cost Component | Estimated Annual Amount |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Bank trustee annual maintenance fee | $800 - $2,000 USD |
| Administrative and filing fees | $200 - $500 USD |
| **Total Estimated Annual Cost** | **$1,000 - $2,500 USD** |

*Midpoint estimate: approximately $1,500 USD per year.*

### 7.3 Cost in Context

For a property valued at $1-3 million USD, the annual fideicomiso maintenance cost of approximately $1,500 represents less than 0.15% of property value -- a negligible carrying cost that is standard for foreign-owned real estate in Mexico's coastal zones.

## 8. Rights of the Beneficiary

### 8.1 Comprehensive Rights Summary

As beneficiary of the fideicomiso, TE Real Estate Mexico, S.A. de C.V. holds the following rights, which are functionally equivalent to direct ownership:

| **Lease** | Right to lease all or part of the property to third parties; collect all rental income |
| **Develop** | Right to construct, renovate, expand, and improve the property |
| **Sell** | Right to sell the property (or the beneficial interest) and receive all proceeds |

| **Bequeath** | Right to designate substitute beneficiaries in the event of dissolution or succession |
| **Insure** | Right to obtain insurance and receive proceeds |
| **Litigate** | Right to defend property rights and pursue claims related to the property |

### 8.2 Trustee Limitations

- The trustee **may not** sell, lease, or encumber the property without written instructions from the beneficiary
- The trustee **may not** use the property for its own purposes

- The trustee's role is passive custodianship of legal title
- The trustee has no economic interest in the property

### 8.3 Beneficiary Substitution

The beneficiary may transfer its beneficial interest by:

- Instructing the trustee to register a new beneficiary

- Paying applicable transfer taxes (acquisition tax: 2-4% of assessed value)
- This mechanism allows for sale of the property by transferring the beneficial interest rather than the property itself, which can provide tax and administrative efficiencies

> **PENDING** -- Bank trustee selection will be finalized upon engagement of Mexican legal counsel and property acquisition due diligence.

### 9.2 Candidate Banks

The following Mexican banking institutions are candidates for the trustee role:

| Bank | Strengths | Considerations |
|------|-----------|---------------|

| Scotiabank Mexico | Strong real estate trust division; good English-language support | Smaller trust portfolio than BBVA |
| HSBC Mexico | International presence; familiar to foreign investors | Higher fee structure in some cases |
| Banorte | Major Mexican bank; competitive fees; strong regional presence | Less international investor experience |

---

## 10. Operational Considerations

### 10.1 Intercompany Lease Arrangement

TE Operations Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (the operating entity) will occupy the property pursuant to a lease or use agreement with TE Real Estate Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (the real estate entity). This intercompany arrangement:

- Provides clear separation between operating and real estate risk
- Creates a deductible expense for the operating entity
- Generates revenue for the real estate entity (subject to transfer pricing rules)
- Must be at arm's-length terms per Mexican tax regulations

### 10.2 Property Tax (Predial)

- Property tax (predial) is assessed by the municipal government of Tulum
- Payable quarterly or annually
- Based on assessed property value (typically below market value)
- Paid by the beneficiary through the trust or directly

### 10.3 Property Insurance

- Property insurance should be obtained in the name of the fideicomiso beneficiary
- Trustee bank may require proof of insurance as a condition of the trust
- Coverage should include: property damage, natural disaster, liability, business interruption

---

## 11. Risks and Considerations

### 11.1 Legal and Regulatory Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Constitutional amendment eliminating fideicomiso | Very Low | High | Monitor legislative developments; maintain legal counsel |
| SRE policy changes affecting renewals | Low | Medium | File renewal applications well in advance of expiration |
| Bank trustee financial instability | Low | Medium | Select well-capitalized bank; trust assets are segregated from bank assets |
| Title defects discovered post-acquisition | Low | High | Comprehensive title search; title insurance (available in Mexico) |

### 11.2 Practical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Bureaucratic delays in setup process | Medium | Low | Engage experienced legal counsel and regulatory consultant |
| Annual fee increases by bank trustee | Low | Low | Negotiate fee cap in trust deed; ability to change trustee |
| Communication delays with trustee bank | Medium | Low | Establish designated contact; regular communication schedule |
| Property lien or encumbrance issues | Low | Medium | Obtain certificate of no liens before acquisition; ongoing monitoring |

### 11.3 Important Protections

- **Trust assets are segregated:** Even if the trustee bank faces financial difficulties, the trust assets (property) are legally separate from the bank's own assets and are not subject to the bank's creditors
- **Trustee substitution:** The beneficiary has the right to change the trustee bank if service is unsatisfactory
- **Renewable term:** The 50-year term is renewable, providing indefinite ownership capability
- **Constitutional protection:** The fideicomiso mechanism is embedded in Mexico's constitutional framework and has been used successfully for decades by thousands of foreign property owners

## 12. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is the fideicomiso structure secure for foreign investors?**
A: Yes. The fideicomiso has been the standard mechanism for foreign property ownership in Mexico's restricted zone since 1973. Thousands of U.S. and international investors and companies use this structure. It is well-established in Mexican law, with extensive case precedent and regulatory support.

**Q: Can the bank sell the property without the beneficiary's consent?**
A: No. The trustee bank holds bare legal title only and may not take any action regarding the property without written instructions from the beneficiary. The bank has no economic interest in the property.

**Q: What happens if the trustee bank goes bankrupt?**
A: Trust assets are legally segregated from the bank's own assets and are not available to the bank's creditors. In the event of bank insolvency, the trust would be transferred to a successor trustee appointed by the banking regulator (CNBV).

**Q: Can the fideicomiso term be extended beyond 50 years?**
A: Yes. The 50-year term is renewable for additional 50-year periods by application to the SRE. Renewals are routinely granted.

**Q: Does the fideicomiso create any tax disadvantages?**
A: No. The fideicomiso structure is tax-neutral. The beneficiary is treated as the economic owner for tax purposes. Property tax, capital gains tax, and other obligations are the same as for direct ownership.

**Q: Can the beneficial interest be sold or transferred?**
A: Yes. The beneficiary may transfer its beneficial interest through a notarized transaction, which functions similarly to a property sale. This can be more efficient than transferring the underlying property title in some cases.
