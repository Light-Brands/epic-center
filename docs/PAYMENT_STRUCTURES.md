## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines how we structure deals for the Fundraising Infrastructure Platform. While the [Service Pricing document](FUNDRAISING_PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRICING.md) defines **what we sell and at what price**, this guide defines **when to offer which payment structure**, the math behind each option, margin thresholds, risk controls, and sales positioning.

### Two Payment Structures

| Structure | Split | Premium | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| **50/50 Standard** | 50% kickoff / 50% delivery | None | Default. Fast cash, zero collection risk. |
| **30/70 Deferred ("Confidence Model")** | 30% upfront / 70% after raise closes | 10-15% on deferred portion | Market-share grab. Lower barrier to entry converts more deals. |

### Five Raise Tiers

| Raise Target | Package | Price Point |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| $5M | Launch Pad | $75K |
| $10M | War Chest | $200K |
| $25M | Full Arsenal | $450K |
| $50M | Full Arsenal+ | $600K |
| $100M+ | Full Arsenal Enterprise | $750K |

### Core Thesis

The 50/50 structure maximizes per-deal cash flow. The 30/70 structure maximizes deal volume by lowering the upfront commitment barrier. When applied to a qualified pipeline, the portfolio expected value of 30/70 exceeds 50/50 — even accounting for deals where the raise never closes.

The 30% upfront covers internal delivery costs at every tier with 1.5x-2.4x headroom. The 70% deferred portion is 100% margin.

---

## 2. Package-to-Raise-Size Mapping

Our three published package tiers (see [Service Pricing](FUNDRAISING_PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRICING.md#package-tiers)) map to five raise-size tiers for payment structuring purposes:

| Raise Target | Package | Published Range | Deal Price | Rationale |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| **$5M** | Launch Pad | $75K - $150K | **$75K** | Entry-level raise. Floor pricing to capture deal flow. |
| **$10M** | War Chest | $150K - $300K | **$200K** | Mid-range War Chest. Standard growth-stage engagement. |
| **$25M** | Full Arsenal | $350K - $750K | **$450K** | Mid-range Full Arsenal. Full 9-category deployment. |
| **$50M** | Full Arsenal+ | $350K - $750K | **$600K** | Enhanced Full Arsenal with deeper financial modeling, expanded investor targeting, and multi-jurisdiction structuring. |
| **$100M+** | Full Arsenal Enterprise | $350K - $750K | **$750K** | Full Arsenal ceiling. Maximum scope depth across all categories, dedicated senior oversight, extended support window. |

The $50M and $100M+ tiers are not new packages — they are depth extensions of Full Arsenal. Pricing stays within the published $350K-$750K range. The premium over the base $450K is justified by incremental scope:

- **$50M ($600K):** Enhanced financial modeling with multiple scenario analyses, expanded investor universe targeting (100+ vs. 50+), multi-entity structuring documentation, and 60-day post-delivery support.
- **$100M+ ($750K):** Everything above plus institutional-grade governance documentation, LP/GP structuring support, regulatory compliance review coordination, and 90-day post-delivery support with quarterly check-ins.

---

## 3. Structure 1: 50/50 Standard

### How It Works

| Milestone | Payment | Timing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 50% of deal price | Day 0 |
| Final deliverable handoff | 50% of deal price | Day 14-30 (per package timeline) |

### Pricing by Tier

| Raise | Deal Price | Kickoff (50%) | Delivery (50%) | Total |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| $5M | $75,000 | $37,500 | $37,500 | **$75,000** |
| $10M | $200,000 | $100,000 | $100,000 | **$200,000** |
| $25M | $450,000 | $225,000 | $225,000 | **$450,000** |
| $50M | $600,000 | $300,000 | $300,000 | **$600,000** |
| $100M+ | $750,000 | $375,000 | $375,000 | **$750,000** |

### Characteristics

- **Total cost to client:** Listed price. No premium.
- **Cash flow:** Immediate. 50% collected before any work begins.
- **Collection risk:** Near zero. Second payment due on delivery — client has already committed half and wants the deliverables.
- **When to use:** Default structure. Always lead with 50/50.

---

## 4. Structure 2: 30/70 Deferred (Confidence Model)

### How It Works

| Milestone | Payment | Timing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 30% of deal price | Day 0 |
| Successful capital raise | 70% of deal price + premium | Within 12 months of delivery |

A **tiered premium** is applied to the deferred 70% portion to compensate for time value of money, collection risk, and extended engagement. The premium scales inversely with raise size — higher at smaller tiers (greater default risk), lower at larger tiers (stronger completion rates).

### Pricing by Tier

| Raise | Upfront (30%) | Base Deferred (70%) | Premium Rate | Premium Amount | Total Deferred | Grand Total |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| $5M | $22,500 | $52,500 | 15.0% | $7,875 | **$60,375** | **$82,875** |
| $10M | $60,000 | $140,000 | 12.5% | $17,500 | **$157,500** | **$217,500** |
| $25M | $135,000 | $315,000 | 12.5% | $39,375 | **$354,375** | **$489,375** |
| $50M | $180,000 | $420,000 | 10.0% | $42,000 | **$462,000** | **$642,000** |
| $100M+ | $225,000 | $525,000 | 10.0% | $52,500 | **$577,500** | **$802,500** |

### Premium Rationale

| Tier | Premium | Justification |
|------|---------|---------------|
| $5M | 15% | Highest default risk. Smaller raises have lower completion rates (~55%). Thinnest cost-coverage margin. |
| $10M | 12.5% | Moderate risk. Growth-stage companies with some traction. ~60% completion rate. |
| $25M | 12.5% | Moderate risk. Larger raises but still venture-stage. ~65% completion rate. |
| $50M | 10% | Lower risk. Established companies with revenue. ~70% completion rate. |
| $100M+ | 10% | Lowest risk. Late-stage or institutional-grade companies. ~75% completion rate. |

### Characteristics

- **Total cost to client (if raise succeeds):** 10-15% above listed price. Framed as "aligned incentives," not a surcharge.
- **Cash flow:** Front-loaded cost coverage only. Profit realization deferred.
- **Collection risk:** Material. Dependent on external fundraising outcome.
- **When to use:** Qualified deals only. Client shows strong fundamentals but has legitimate budget constraints on upfront spend.

## 5. Complete Pricing Matrix

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Raise | Package | 50/50 Total | 30/70 Total | 30/70 Premium ($) | 30/70 Premium (%) |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| $5M | Launch Pad | $75,000 | $82,875 | +$7,875 | +10.5% |
| $10M | War Chest | $200,000 | $217,500 | +$17,500 | +8.8% |
| $25M | Full Arsenal | $450,000 | $489,375 | +$39,375 | +8.8% |
| $50M | Full Arsenal+ | $600,000 | $642,000 | +$42,000 | +7.0% |
| $100M+ | Full Arsenal Enterprise | $750,000 | $802,500 | +$52,500 | +7.0% |

> **Note:** The "30/70 Premium (%)" column shows the effective total price increase over the 50/50 structure. This is lower than the deferred premium rate because the premium applies only to the 70% deferred portion, not the full deal price. For example, at $5M: 15% premium on 70% of the deal = 10.5% effective increase on the total.

### Cash Flow Comparison (Day 0 Collections)

| Raise | 50/50 Day 0 | 30/70 Day 0 | Day 0 Difference |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| $5M | $37,500 | $22,500 | -$15,000 |
| $10M | $100,000 | $60,000 | -$40,000 |
| $25M | $225,000 | $135,000 | -$90,000 |
| $50M | $300,000 | $180,000 | -$120,000 |
| $100M+ | $375,000 | $225,000 | -$150,000 |

The 30/70 structure collects 40% less cash on Day 0 than the 50/50 structure. This is the cost of lowering the barrier to entry. It is recovered — with premium — when the raise closes.

## 6. Margin & Cost Coverage Analysis

### Internal Delivery Costs

Our AI-driven delivery model achieves 96-98% cost reduction versus traditional consulting assembly. Internal delivery costs by package:

| Package | Delivery Cost Range | Midpoint |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| Launch Pad ($5M) | $8,000 - $15,000 | $11,500 |
| War Chest ($10M) | $18,000 - $35,000 | $26,500 |
| Full Arsenal ($25M) | $30,000 - $60,000 | $45,000 |
| Full Arsenal+ ($50M) | $40,000 - $75,000 | $57,500 |
| Full Arsenal Enterprise ($100M+) | $50,000 - $100,000 | $75,000 |

> Costs include: AI compute, human senior review, legal coordination, platform hosting, and client management overhead. They do not include sales/marketing cost of acquisition.

### 50/50 Margin Analysis

| Raise | Revenue | Cost (Mid) | Gross Profit | Gross Margin |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| $5M | $75,000 | $11,500 | $63,500 | **84.7%** |
| $10M | $200,000 | $26,500 | $173,500 | **86.8%** |
| $25M | $450,000 | $45,000 | $405,000 | **90.0%** |
| $50M | $600,000 | $57,500 | $542,500 | **90.4%** |
| $100M+ | $750,000 | $75,000 | $675,000 | **90.0%** |

### 30/70 Margin Analysis (Raise Succeeds)

| Raise | Revenue | Cost (Mid) | Gross Profit | Gross Margin |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| $5M | $82,875 | $11,500 | $71,375 | **86.1%** |
| $10M | $217,500 | $26,500 | $191,000 | **87.8%** |
| $25M | $489,375 | $45,000 | $444,375 | **90.8%** |
| $50M | $642,000 | $57,500 | $584,500 | **91.0%** |
| $100M+ | $802,500 | $75,000 | $727,500 | **90.7%** |

### 30/70 Worst Case (Raise Fails — Upfront Only)

| Raise | Upfront Collected | Cost (Mid) | Profit / (Loss) | Margin |
|-------|-------------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| $5M | $22,500 | $11,500 | $11,000 | 48.9% |
| $10M | $60,000 | $26,500 | $33,500 | 55.8% |
| $25M | $135,000 | $45,000 | $90,000 | 66.7% |
| $50M | $180,000 | $57,500 | $122,500 | 68.1% |
| $100M+ | $225,000 | $75,000 | $150,000 | 66.7% |

**Key insight:** Even in the worst case (raise fails entirely), the 30% upfront covers all delivery costs and generates positive margin at every tier. The $5M tier is thinnest at $11,000 profit — this is why $5M deals on 30/70 require the highest qualification bar.

### Cost Coverage Multiples

| Raise | 30% Upfront | Cost (Mid) | Coverage Multiple |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| $5M | $22,500 | $11,500 | **2.0x** |
| $10M | $60,000 | $26,500 | **2.3x** |
| $25M | $135,000 | $45,000 | **3.0x** |
| $50M | $180,000 | $57,500 | **3.1x** |
| $100M+ | $225,000 | $75,000 | **3.0x** |

The 30% upfront payment covers delivery costs with 2.0x-3.1x headroom across all tiers. Even against high-end cost estimates:

| Raise | 30% Upfront | Cost (High) | Coverage Multiple |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| $5M | $22,500 | $15,000 | **1.5x** |
| $10M | $60,000 | $35,000 | **1.7x** |
| $25M | $135,000 | $60,000 | **2.3x** |
| $50M | $180,000 | $75,000 | **2.4x** |
| $100M+ | $225,000 | $100,000 | **2.3x** |

The $5M tier at high-end costs drops to 1.5x coverage — viable but thin. Offer selectively.

## 7. Risk Framework

### Risk Categories

| Risk | 50/50 Exposure | 30/70 Exposure | Mitigation |
|------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Non-payment (delivery milestone)** | Moderate — client owes 50% on delivery | N/A — no delivery payment | Standard contract enforcement |
| **Non-payment (raise-contingent)** | N/A | High — 70% contingent on external outcome | Premium pricing, qualification gates, contractual protections |
| **Raise failure** | None — fully collected regardless | Material — deferred portion never collected | Portfolio diversification, qualification scoring |
| **Raise delay** | None | Moderate — cash flow timing risk | 12-month window with escalation clauses |
| **Scope creep** | Low | Moderate — longer engagement lifecycle | Deliverable-locked scope; changes require amendment |
| **Client abandonment** | Low — minimal post-delivery interaction | Moderate — must track raise progress | Quarterly check-ins, abandonment triggers |
| **Portfolio concentration** | N/A | High if too many 30/70 deals | Hard cap: max 5 active 30/70 engagements |

### Risk-Adjusted Expected Value

Using estimated raise success rates to compute expected revenue per deal:

| Raise | Success Rate | 50/50 EV | 30/70 EV | 30/70 vs. 50/50 |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| $5M | 55% | $75,000 | $55,706 | -25.7% |
| $10M | 60% | $200,000 | $154,500 | -22.8% |
| $25M | 65% | $450,000 | $365,344 | -18.8% |
| $50M | 70% | $600,000 | $503,400 | -16.1% |
| $100M+ | 75% | $750,000 | $658,125 | -12.3% |

> **30/70 EV formula:** Upfront + (Success Rate x Total Deferred)
>
> Example ($5M): $22,500 + (0.55 x $60,375) = $22,500 + $33,206 = **$55,706**

### The Volume Thesis

On a per-deal basis, 30/70 has 12-26% lower expected value than 50/50. The strategic thesis is that the lower upfront barrier converts significantly more deals:

| Scenario | 50/50 Deals | 50/50 Portfolio EV | 30/70 Deals | 30/70 Portfolio EV |
|----------|------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| $10M tier, 1.5x volume | 10 | $2,000,000 | 15 | $2,317,500 |
| $25M tier, 2x volume | 5 | $2,250,000 | 10 | $3,653,440 |
| $50M tier, 1.5x volume | 4 | $2,400,000 | 6 | $3,020,400 |
| Mixed portfolio, 1.75x | 10 | $3,500,000 | 17-18 | $4,500,000+ |

**Break-even conversion multiplier:** 30/70 matches 50/50 portfolio EV when it generates ~1.3x the deal volume. Anything above that is pure upside.

---

## 8. Deal Qualification Criteria

### Qualification Scoring Rubric

Every prospective 30/70 engagement must pass a structured qualification assessment. Score each factor 1-5:

| Factor | Weight | 1 (Weak) | 3 (Adequate) | 5 (Strong) |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Business Viability** | 25% | Pre-revenue, unvalidated concept | MVP with early revenue or strong LOIs | Proven revenue, clear unit economics |
| **Fundraising Readiness** | 20% | No materials, no strategy | Some materials, general plan | Prior raise experience, clear use of proceeds |
| **Team Quality** | 15% | Solo founder, no domain expertise | Small team with relevant experience | Experienced team with exits or institutional backgrounds |
| **Market Timing** | 15% | Contracting market or unclear thesis | Stable market with identifiable opportunity | Hot sector with demonstrated investor appetite |
| **Investor Pipeline** | 15% | No investor relationships | Warm introductions, some interest | Active conversations, term sheet potential |
| **Raise Size Credibility** | 10% | Target far exceeds business stage | Target is ambitious but defensible | Target matches stage, comps, and market norms |

### Scoring Thresholds

| Score | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| **4.0 - 5.0** | Strong 30/70 candidate. Proceed with standard terms. |
| **3.5 - 3.9** | Qualified with conditions. Consider requiring higher upfront (35-40%) or shorter window. |
| **3.0 - 3.4** | Marginal. 30/70 only at $10M+ tiers. Decline at $5M. |
| **Below 3.0** | Do not offer 30/70. 50/50 only, or decline engagement. |

### Tier-Specific Minimums

| Raise | Minimum Score | Rationale |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| $5M | **3.5** | Thinnest margins ($11K worst-case profit). Only offer to strong candidates. |
| $10M | **3.0** | Adequate margin headroom. Standard qualification bar. |
| $25M | **3.0** | Strong margin. Standard bar. |
| $50M | **3.0** | Excellent margin. Standard bar. Company quality is self-selecting at this raise size. |
| $100M+ | **3.0** | Maximum margin. Companies raising $100M+ are inherently pre-qualified on most factors. |

### Automatic Disqualifiers (Any Tier)

- No legal entity formed
- Active litigation that would impair fundraising
- Founder unable to commit full-time to the raise
- Regulatory barriers with no clear resolution path
- Prior raise attempt failed with no material change in circumstances

## 9. Payment Triggers, Protections & Contractual Terms

### Definition of "Successful Raise"

A raise is deemed successful when the client has received aggregate investment commitments of **50% or more of the stated target amount** from **non-affiliated investors** (i.e., not founders, family members, or entities controlled by founders).

| Raise Target | Success Threshold (50%) |
|--------------|------------------------|
| $5M | $2,500,000 |
| $10M | $5,000,000 |
| $25M | $12,500,000 |
| $50M | $25,000,000 |
| $100M+ | $50,000,000 |

### Payment Windows

| Window | Duration | Terms |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Standard** | 12 months from final deliverable handoff | Full deferred amount due within 30 days of successful raise or 12-month expiry, whichever comes first. |
| **Extension** | 12-18 months | Available by mutual agreement. +5% premium escalation on remaining deferred balance. |
| **Hard Cap** | 18 months | Absolute deadline. Full deferred amount (with escalation) due regardless of raise status. |

### Escalation Math

If a client extends from 12 to 18 months, an additional 5% premium applies to the deferred balance:

| Raise | Original Deferred | +5% Escalation | Extended Total Deferred |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| $5M | $60,375 | $3,019 | $63,394 |
| $10M | $157,500 | $7,875 | $165,375 |
| $25M | $354,375 | $17,719 | $372,094 |
| $50M | $462,000 | $23,100 | $485,100 |
| $100M+ | $577,500 | $28,875 | $606,375 |

### Contractual Protections

**Deliverable Licensing**
- All deliverables are **licensed, not transferred** until full payment is received.
- Client receives a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use deliverables for fundraising purposes only.
- Full ownership transfers upon receipt of final payment.
- If payment is never received, license terminates and deliverables must be returned or destroyed.

**Quarterly Check-ins**
- Client must participate in quarterly progress check-ins (30-minute calls) to maintain active engagement status.
- Two consecutive missed check-ins = **deemed abandonment**.
- Deemed abandonment triggers immediate payment obligation for the full deferred amount.

**Acquisition Clawback**
- If the client company is acquired (asset sale, stock sale, or merger) before the deferred payment is made, the full deferred amount becomes immediately due from transaction proceeds.
- Clawback applies regardless of whether the capital raise was completed.
- Structured as a first-priority claim against transaction proceeds in the engagement agreement.

**Portfolio Cap**
- Maximum **5 active 30/70 engagements** at any time.
- "Active" = contract signed, deferred payment outstanding, within the payment window.
- This limits aggregate downside exposure to ~$300K in deferred delivery costs (5 deals x $60K avg cost) while maintaining upside potential of $1.6M-$2.9M in deferred revenue.
- When the cap is reached, all new engagements must be 50/50 until an active 30/70 engagement resolves.

## 10. Sales Positioning Guide

### The Golden Rule

**Always lead with 50/50.** The 30/70 structure is introduced only when:
1. The client is qualified (Score >= 3.0, tier-adjusted minimum met)
2. The client has expressed genuine budget constraints on upfront spend
3. The deal would otherwise be lost

The 30/70 is a conversion tool, not a default offer.

### Positioning Language

**Do say:**
- "We offer a Confidence Model for qualified companies — we put skin in the game alongside you."
- "We're so confident in what we deliver that we'll defer the majority of our fee until your raise closes."
- "This structure aligns our incentives — we succeed when you succeed."
- "The Confidence Model includes a modest premium to reflect the extended payment timeline, but it dramatically reduces your upfront capital commitment."

**Do not say:**
- "Discount" — it's not a discount, it's a different structure with a premium.
- "We'll take a percentage of the raise" — this is a fixed fee, not a success fee.
- "Our costs are low, so we can afford it" — never disclose internal cost structure.
- "We offer financing" — this is a payment structure, not a loan.

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Why is the 30/70 total higher than 50/50?" | "The Confidence Model includes a small premium that reflects the extended timeline. You're trading a higher total cost for dramatically lower upfront commitment — and you only pay the balance after your raise succeeds." |
| "Can we do 20/80 or 10/90?" | "The 30% upfront is our minimum to begin engagement. It covers our commitment of senior resources to your project from Day 1. We can't start without it." |
| "Can we remove the premium?" | "The premium is part of the Confidence Model structure. For zero-premium pricing, we offer our standard 50/50 structure." |
| "What if our raise takes longer than 12 months?" | "We include a standard 12-month window with the option to extend to 18 months. We want to give you every chance to succeed." |
| "Can we pay from raise proceeds?" | "That's exactly what the Confidence Model is designed for. Your 70% balance is due after your raise closes — funded directly from the capital you've raised." |

### Conversation Flow

```
1. Present 50/50 pricing
   └── Client agrees → Close on 50/50 ✓

2. Client pushes back on upfront cost
   └── Probe: Is it budget constraints or perceived value?
       ├── Perceived value → Reinforce ROI, case studies, comparable costs
       │   └── Client agrees → Close on 50/50 ✓

### What We Never Disclose

- Internal delivery costs or margin structure
- Cost coverage multiples
- Portfolio cap or active 30/70 count
- Qualification scoring criteria or client scores
- Risk-adjusted expected value calculations
- Raise success rate assumptions

## 11. Appendix: Worked Examples

### Example A: $10M War Chest — 50/50 Standard

**Scenario:** Growth-stage SaaS company raising $10M Series A. Strong team, $2M ARR, clear use of proceeds. No budget constraints.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deal price | $200,000 |
| Kickoff payment (50%) | $100,000 |
| Delivery payment (50%) | $100,000 |
| **Total collected** | **$200,000** |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $26,500 |
| **Gross profit** | **$173,500** |
| **Gross margin** | **86.8%** |

Timeline: Kickoff Day 0, delivery Day 21, fully collected by Day 21.

---

### Example B: $25M Full Arsenal — 30/70 Confidence Model (Raise Succeeds)

**Scenario:** Med-tech company raising $25M Series B. Experienced team, $8M revenue, strong investor pipeline. CFO concerned about deploying $225K upfront while also funding clinical trials.

Qualification score: 4.2 / 5.0 (exceeds 3.0 minimum).

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deal price (base) | $450,000 |
| Upfront payment (30%) | $135,000 |
| Deferred base (70%) | $315,000 |
| Premium (12.5%) | $39,375 |
| **Total deferred** | **$354,375** |
| **Grand total** | **$489,375** |

The raise closes in month 8 at $28M (exceeds 50% threshold on day of first close at $14M).

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total collected | $489,375 |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $45,000 |
| **Gross profit** | **$444,375** |
| **Gross margin** | **90.8%** |

### Example C: $5M Launch Pad — 30/70 Confidence Model (Raise Fails)

**Scenario:** Consumer wellness startup raising $5M seed round. First-time founder, compelling product, early traction. Score: 3.5 (meets $5M minimum).

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deal price (base) | $75,000 |
| Upfront payment (30%) | $22,500 |
| Deferred (70% + 15% premium) | $60,375 |
| **Grand total (if raise succeeds)** | **$82,875** |

The raise stalls. After 12 months, the client has raised $1.8M (below the $2.5M success threshold). Client requests extension.

**Month 12-18 (Extension):**
- +5% escalation on $60,375 = $3,019 additional
- New deferred total: $63,394

At month 18 (hard cap), the raise has reached $2.2M. Still below threshold, but the hard cap triggers payment obligation.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $22,500 |
| Deferred collected (hard cap enforcement) | $63,394 |
| **Total collected** | **$85,894** |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $11,500 |
| **Gross profit** | **$74,394** |

> **Note:** Hard cap collection requires enforcement. In practice, a client who failed to raise may have limited ability to pay. The contractual right to collect is clear, but actual recovery may involve negotiation, payment plans, or partial write-off. This is why the $5M tier requires the highest qualification score.

---

### Example D: $50M Full Arsenal+ — 30/70 with Acquisition Clawback

**Scenario:** Health-tech platform raising $50M. During month 6, before the raise closes, the company receives and accepts a $120M acquisition offer.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $180,000 |
| Deferred owed (clawback triggered) | $462,000 |
| **Total collected** | **$642,000** |

The acquisition clawback provision triggers immediate payment from transaction proceeds. The company pays $462,000 from the $120M acquisition — a trivial 0.39% of proceeds.

---

### Example E: Portfolio Scenario — 5 Active 30/70 Engagements

**Scenario:** Maximum portfolio at cap.

| # | Raise | Upfront Collected | Deferred Outstanding | Est. Success Rate |
|---|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | $10M | $60,000 | $157,500 | 60% |
| 2 | $25M | $135,000 | $354,375 | 65% |
| 3 | $25M | $135,000 | $354,375 | 65% |
| 4 | $50M | $180,000 | $462,000 | 70% |
| 5 | $100M+ | $225,000 | $577,500 | 75% |
| **Total** | | **$735,000** | **$1,905,750** | |

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total upfront collected | $735,000 |
| Total delivery costs (est.) | $249,000 |
| **Upfront profit (guaranteed)** | **$486,000** |
| Expected deferred collection (probability-weighted) | $1,311,713 |
| **Expected total portfolio revenue** | **$2,046,713** |
| **Expected total portfolio profit** | **$1,797,713** |

Worst case (all raises fail): $486,000 profit on $735,000 collected. The business remains profitable even in catastrophic market conditions.
