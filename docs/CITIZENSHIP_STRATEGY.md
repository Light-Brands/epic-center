## Executive Summary

### Current Situation
- US citizen currently living in Costa Rica
- Planning to establish Church of Living Light (genuine religious organization)
- Strong desire to minimize US ties while maintaining family access (Boston/Miami)
- Planning international travel: Costa Rica → Brazil → Europe → US

### Primary Goals
1. Obtain second citizenship(s) to create independence from US
2. Evaluate renouncing US citizenship (tax freedom, philosophical alignment)
3. Maintain ability to visit US family regularly
4. Establish Church of Living Light in optimal jurisdiction
5. Maximize global mobility and freedom

### Recommended Path
1. **Obtain Grenada citizenship** ($250k, 4-6 months) - provides E-2 visa access to US
2. **Start Paraguay residency** ($8k, 3 years to citizenship) - backup passport
3. **Consider Portugal Golden Visa** (€280k, 5 years to EU citizenship) - premium option
4. **Renounce US citizenship** after securing alternatives (2027-2028)
5. **Maintain US access** via E-2 visa or ESTA depending on passport portfolio
6. **Establish church** in optimal jurisdiction (likely Panama or Costa Rica initially)

## Understanding 508(c)(1)(a) Religious Organizations

### What It Is
- Churches are automatically tax-exempt under IRC 508(c)(1)(a)
- No IRS application required (unlike 501(c)(3))
- No IRS determination letter
- Must meet IRS definition of "church":
  - Regular worship services
  - Organized congregation
  - Ordained ministers/religious leaders
  - Established doctrine and religious education
  - Formal worship locations

### US 508(c)(1)(a) Implications

**If Established in US:**
- Automatically tax-exempt without application
- Subject to IRS oversight and potential audits
- Must comply with US nonprofit regulations
- Can operate internationally from US base
- Founder/operators face US reporting requirements

**Critical Issue for US Citizens:**
- US citizens pay tax on **worldwide income** regardless of location
- If church structure appears to be personal asset vehicle, IRS can challenge
- Penalties for improper use of religious organizations are severe
- Personal liability exposure

### Alternative: Don't Use US Structure

**Better Options:**
- Establish in country where you'll primarily operate
- International religious organization (multi-jurisdictional)
- Panama Private Interest Foundation (privacy, flexibility)
- Costa Rica Asociación Religiosa (local presence)
- Portuguese Associação (EU legitimacy)
- Swiss Verein (international prestige)
- Operate informally initially while exploring options

**Recommendation:** Do NOT rush into US 508(c)(1)(a). Premature commitment to US jurisdiction when you don't want US ties doesn't make strategic sense.

## US Citizenship Renunciation

### The Process

**Prerequisites:**
1. Must have or be obtaining second citizenship (cannot be stateless)
2. Must be current on 5 years of US tax filings
3. Must be outside US when renouncing
4. Must appear in person at US embassy/consulate

**Steps:**
1. Obtain second citizenship first
2. Schedule renunciation appointment at US embassy
3. Complete DS-4079, DS-4080, DS-4081, DS-4083 forms
4. Oath of renunciation before consular officer
5. Pay $2,350 renunciation fee
6. Receive Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN)
7. File Form 8854 (expatriation statement) with final US tax return

**Timeline:** 6-18 months from appointment to final CLN receipt

### The Exit Tax - Critical Information

**Who Pays Exit Tax:**
- Net worth > $2 million USD, OR
- Average annual income tax > $190,000 (last 5 years), OR
- Failed to certify 5 years tax compliance

**How It Works:**
- "Mark-to-market" regime
- IRS treats you as if you sold all worldwide assets day before renunciation
- Pay capital gains tax on unrealized gains
- $866,000 exclusion (2026, inflation-adjusted)
- Can defer with bond/security but interest accrues

**Example Calculation:**

If net worth is $3M:
- Primary residence: $800k (basis $400k) = $400k gain
- Investment accounts: $1.2M (basis $600k) = $600k gain
- Business interests: $500k (basis $200k) = $300k gain
- Other assets: $500k (basis $400k) = $100k gain
- **Total gains: $1.4M**
- Minus exclusion: $866k
- **Taxable: $534k**
- Tax at 20% capital gains rate: **~$107k exit tax**

**Assets Exempt:**
- Retirement accounts (deferred until distribution, but 30% withholding)
- Primary residence up to $250k/$500k gain exclusion

### Ongoing Implications

**After Renunciation:**
- File US taxes for year of renunciation (partial year)
- No future US tax filing requirements
- Form 8854 must be filed or face severe penalties
- Cannot reclaim citizenship (essentially permanent)
- May face re-entry restrictions if deemed tax-motivated

**Impact on US Family:**
- Gifts to US family members: $18,000/year limit before gift tax
- Inheritances: Estate tax implications
- Cannot sponsor family for green cards

**Loss of US Passport Benefits:**
- US passport provides visa-free access to ~186 countries
- Consular assistance worldwide
- Some countries easier to access with US passport
- US banking becomes difficult/impossible

### Reed Amendment (Re-entry Ban)

**The Law:**
- Can be barred from re-entering US if renunciation deemed tax-motivated
- Rarely enforced but risk exists
- Attorney General must determine renunciation was to avoid taxes

**Practical Reality:**
- Very few people actually banned
- Burden of proof on US government
- More of a threat than actual enforcement
- Still, it's a legal risk

### Real Estate Option - What to Know

**How It Works:**
- Invest in "government-approved" real estate
- Usually luxury resort/hotel fractional ownership
- Own X weeks per year OR fractional share
- Must hold for 3-7 years (varies by country)
- After holding period, can resell
- New buyer can also use purchase for CBI

**Reality Check:**
- Properties often **overpriced by 20-30%** compared to market value
- You're paying a "citizenship premium"
- Rental income usually minimal or non-existent
- May not recover full investment on resale
- Developer risk (project delays, non-completion)
- Ongoing management fees and maintenance costs
- Hidden fees and charges

**When Real Estate Makes Sense:**
- You genuinely want Caribbean vacation property
- You'll use your allotted weeks
- You can afford the premium
- You want something tangible vs. pure donation
- You're comfortable with real estate risk

**When Donation Route Is Better:**
- You want lowest total cost
- You don't want property management hassles
- You won't use Caribbean property
- You prioritize simplicity
- You want quickest process (less paperwork)

---

## US Access After Renunciation

Once you renounce US citizenship, your ability to enter and stay in the US depends entirely on **which passport(s) you hold**.

---

### Option 1: ESTA Visa Waiver Program (90 Days)

**Available with these passports:**
- All EU countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, etc.)
- UK, Ireland
- Japan, South Korea, Singapore
- Australia, New Zealand
- Chile
- ~40 countries total

**How It Works:**
- Apply online at https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov
- Cost: $21
- Usually approved instantly
- Valid for 2 years
- Each visit: Up to **90 days**
- Can visit multiple times per year
- **Cannot work in US**
- **Cannot "live" in US** (must be genuine visitor)

**Practical Limits:**
- Can do 90 days, leave for a week, return for 90 days
- **BUT:** If pattern suggests you're "living" in US, immigration can deny entry
- Generally safe: 2-3 visits per year, 90 days each = ~270 days/year
- Risky: Trying to stay 300+ days per year

**Immigration Red Flags:**
- More time in US than abroad
- No clear foreign residence/job
- Light luggage (looks like you live in US)
- Repeated long stays
- US address on forms

**Caribbean Passports DON'T Have ESTA:**
- ❌ Grenada - need visa
- ❌ St. Kitts & Nevis - need visa
- ❌ Dominica - need visa
- ❌ Antigua & Barbuda - need visa
- ❌ St. Lucia - need visa

**This is critical.** If you only have Caribbean passport after renouncing US citizenship, you cannot visit US visa-free.

---

### Option 2: B-1/B-2 Tourist Visa (Up to 180 Days)

**For passports without ESTA** (like all Caribbean CBI countries):

**How It Works:**
1. Apply at US embassy/consulate
2. Fill out DS-160 form
3. Pay $185 fee
4. Schedule visa interview
5. Attend interview with documents:
   - Proof of foreign residence
   - Proof of financial stability
   - Ties abroad (property, business, family)
   - Evidence you'll return home
6. If approved: 10-year multiple-entry visa (typical)
7. Each entry: Up to **180 days** (6 months) at immigration officer's discretion

**Approval Rates (approximate):**
- Grenada passport holders: ~70-80%
- St. Kitts: ~70-80%
- Dominica: ~60-70%
- Antigua: ~75-85%

**Important:** Approval is **NOT guaranteed**. US can deny for any reason.

**Practical Limits:**
- Same as ESTA: Cannot "live" in US
- Pattern of 6 months in US, 1 month out, 6 months in → will raise red flags
- Safe approach: 3-6 months per year total, not all consecutive
- Must maintain genuine foreign residence

**Downsides vs. ESTA:**
- Requires interview (travel to embassy)
- Can be denied
- More scrutiny
- Less flexible

### Option 3: E-2 Treaty Investor Visa - THE GAME CHANGER ⭐

**ONLY available with Grenada passport** among Caribbean options (also available with many other countries including Mexico, Canada, Japan, etc.).

**How It Works:**

1. **Form US Business:**
   - LLC or Corporation
   - Must be real operating business (not passive investment)
   - Examples: Restaurant, retail, consulting, import/export, franchise, services

2. **Make Substantial Investment:**
   - Minimum varies by business type
   - Typically $100,000-$200,000
   - Must be at-risk capital
   - Must be irrevocably committed

3. **Business Requirements:**
   - Must be operational (not just startup capital)
   - Must employ Americans (or plan to)
   - Must generate income beyond just supporting you
   - You must have controlling interest (50%+)

4. **Apply for E-2 Visa:**
   - File DS-160
   - Submit business plan
   - Prove investment
   - Interview at US embassy
   - If approved: 5-year visa (for Grenada nationals)

5. **Enter US:**
   - Live in US to run business
   - No time limits while visa valid
   - Can travel freely
   - Spouse gets work authorization
   - Children can study

6. **Renewals:**
   - Renewable indefinitely in 5-year increments
   - As long as business operates
   - Must show business remains viable

**Total Cost:**
- Business investment: $100,000-$200,000
- Legal fees: $10,000-$20,000
- Business setup: $5,000-$10,000
- **All-in: $115,000-$230,000**

**What You CAN Do on E-2:**
- ✅ Live in US full-time
- ✅ Work (in your business)
- ✅ Get US driver's license
- ✅ Open US bank accounts
- ✅ Get health insurance
- ✅ Rent/buy property
- ✅ Travel freely in/out
- ✅ Stay indefinitely (with renewals)

**What You CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ Vote
- ❌ Get government benefits
- ❌ Work for other employers
- ❌ Path to green card/citizenship (E-2 is non-immigrant visa)

**Risks:**
- If business fails, visa ends
- Must actively manage business (not passive)
- If Grenada revokes citizenship, E-2 becomes invalid
- Investment capital is at risk

**Church Connection:**
This could be church-related business:
- Bookstore selling spiritual/religious books
- Event venue that hosts church services
- Café with spiritual focus
- Retreat center
- Publishing company

Must be for-profit (E-2 requires commercial enterprise), but can support church mission.

**This is the golden ticket for US access without citizenship.**

---

### Option 4: R-1 Religious Worker Visa

**If Church of Living Light grows internationally:**

**Requirements:**
- Must have been member/employee of religious organization for 2+ years abroad
- Organization must have tax-exempt status in US (501(c)(3) or 508(c)(1)(a))
- Coming to work as:
  - Minister
  - Religious worker
  - Missionary
  - Other religious occupation

**Benefits:**
- Can stay up to 5 years (30 months initial, can extend to 60 months)
- Can work (for church)
- Spouse and children can accompany
- **Possible path to green card** (special immigrant religious worker category)

**How It Works:**
1. Establish Church of Living Light abroad (Costa Rica, Panama, etc.)
2. Be active member/worker for 2+ years
3. Establish US branch/affiliate
4. US church applies for tax-exempt status
5. US church sponsors you for R-1 visa
6. Work as minister/religious worker in US

**This could be legitimate path if church is genuine** (which you say it is).

**Downsides:**
- 2-year membership requirement abroad first
- Must establish US church entity
- Can only work for church (no outside employment)
- Limited to 5 years initially

## Return Pathway: Regaining US Citizenship After Renunciation

### Core Principle: Stay Married, Keep the Door Open

**The single most important strategic decision:** Do NOT divorce before renouncing. Stay legally married. Your wife's US citizenship is your permanent, clean, legitimate lifeline back into the United States whenever you choose to use it.

**Why staying married is superior to divorce/remarry:**

| Factor | Stay Married | Divorce → Remarry |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Immigration fraud risk** | None | High (USCIS trained to spot this pattern) |
| **Spousal petition available** | Yes, anytime | Only after remarriage |
| **USCIS scrutiny** | Standard | Elevated (pattern triggers investigation) |
| **Criminal exposure** | None | Potential federal charges if deemed sham |
| **Timeline to green card** | 12-18 months whenever you file | 12-18 months AFTER remarriage + scrutiny delays |
| **Legal complexity** | Simple | Two divorces, two marriages, fraud defense |
| **Cost** | ~$5-10k legal | $20-50k+ (divorces, remarriage, immigration defense) |

**The math is simple:** Staying married gives you all the same benefits with none of the legal risk.

---

### How the Return Pathway Works

**Your wife, as a US citizen, can petition for you as an "immediate relative" at any point.** This is the cleanest, fastest family-based immigration pathway in US law.

#### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Your Wife Files Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative)**
- Files with USCIS
- Proves valid marriage (marriage certificate, photos, shared life evidence)
- Filing fee: $535
- Processing time: 5-12 months

**Step 2: National Visa Center Processing**
- Case forwarded to NVC after I-130 approval
- Submit Form DS-260 (Immigrant Visa Application)
- Gather civil documents (birth certificate, police clearances, medical exam)
- Pay immigrant visa fee: $325

**Step 3: Consular Interview**
- Interview at US embassy/consulate in your country of residence
- Present documents, answer questions about relationship and intentions
- Medical exam results submitted
- If approved: Immigrant visa stamped in passport

**Step 4: Enter the US as Lawful Permanent Resident**
- Enter US on immigrant visa
- Green card mailed to US address
- You are now a permanent resident (green card holder)

**Step 5: Wait 3 Years (Married to US Citizen)**
- Maintain continuous residence in US
- Be physically present for at least 18 of 36 months
- No extended trips abroad (6+ months breaks continuity)
- Stay married to the same US citizen spouse

**Step 6: Apply for Naturalization (Form N-400)**
- Filing fee: $710
- Biometrics appointment
- Civics test (100 questions, must answer 6 of 10 correctly)
- English test (reading, writing, speaking)
- Interview with USCIS officer

**Step 7: Take Oath of Allegiance**
- Attend naturalization ceremony
- Take oath
- Receive Certificate of Naturalization
- Apply for US passport

**You are a US citizen again.**

```

**Total timeline: Approximately 4.5 to 5.5 years from when your wife files the petition to when you take the oath.**

This is a real commitment, but it's a clean, legal, well-worn path that thousands of people walk every year.

---

### What Makes This Pathway Clean

**No special rules for former citizens.** Once you renounce, you are legally a foreign national. The immigration system treats you like any other foreign national married to a US citizen. There is no "former citizen" penalty or expedited review.

**Immediate relative = no visa caps.** Unlike other family-based categories (siblings, adult children), spouses of US citizens are "immediate relatives" under INA § 201(b)(2)(A)(i). This means:
- No annual numerical limits
- No waiting in a visa backlog queue
- Processed as quickly as USCIS can handle them

**The marriage is genuine.** You are actually married. You have a real history, shared life, possibly children. This is the strongest possible case for a marriage-based petition. USCIS looks for fraud -- they won't find it because there is none.

---

### Important Considerations for Former Citizens

#### The Covered Expatriate Shadow

If you are classified as a "covered expatriate" at the time of renunciation (net worth > $2M, average tax > $190k, or failed 5-year tax compliance), certain tax consequences follow you even after you return:

**Gifts and bequests TO US persons:**
- Any gift or bequest FROM a covered expatriate TO a US citizen/resident faces a special transfer tax
- Taxed at the highest gift/estate tax rate (~40%) on amounts exceeding the annual exclusion ($18,000/year in 2026)
- This applies to your wife, children, and any other US persons
- **This does NOT expire.** It follows you permanently, even if you regain citizenship

**Strategy to minimize covered expatriate status:**
- Work with expat tax attorney to get net worth below $2M before renunciation
- Transfer assets to wife before renunciation (but watch gift tax implications and timing)
- Ensure 5 years of perfect tax compliance
- Time renunciation when average annual tax liability is below the threshold
- Use the $866,000 gain exclusion strategically

**If you can avoid "covered expatriate" classification, the transfer tax issue disappears entirely.**

#### Green Card Holder Tax Obligations

Once you have a green card, you are a "US person" for tax purposes again:
- Worldwide income is taxable by the US
- Must file annual tax returns
- FBAR reporting on foreign accounts over $10,000
- FATCA compliance

**This is the trade-off.** You regain US access and eventually citizenship, but you also regain US tax obligations. Plan your asset and income structure accordingly before re-entering.

#### Re-entry After the Reed Amendment

The Reed Amendment (INA § 212(a)(10)(E)) makes inadmissible any former citizen who renounced for the purpose of tax avoidance. In practice:

- Rarely enforced (almost never in its history)
- Burden of proof is on the Attorney General
- But filing for a green card creates a touchpoint where this COULD be raised
- Having a genuine marriage and non-tax reasons for renunciation (philosophical, sovereignty, lifestyle) strengthens your position
- Document your non-tax motivations clearly before renouncing

**Practical mitigation:** Consult with an immigration attorney before filing the I-130. They can assess Reed Amendment risk for your specific situation and prepare accordingly.

---

### Alternative Return Pathways (If Marriage Path Not Used)

If for any reason the spousal petition is not available or desired, here are the other paths to permanent residency and eventual citizenship:

#### EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa

- **Investment:** $800,000 (targeted employment area) or $1,050,000 (standard)
- **Job creation:** Must create 10 full-time US jobs
- **Timeline:** 2-4 years to green card
- **Then:** 5 years to naturalization eligibility
- **Total to citizenship:** ~7-9 years
- **Best for:** If you have significant capital and want independence from spousal petition

#### Employment-Based Green Card (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3)

- **EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability):** No employer sponsor needed, but must demonstrate extraordinary achievement
- **EB-1C (Multinational Manager):** Transfer from foreign office of company to US office
- **EB-2/EB-3:** Requires US employer sponsor and labor certification
- **Timeline:** 1-5 years depending on category and country of chargeability
- **Then:** 3-5 years to naturalization
- **Best for:** If you build a substantial business or career outside the US

#### R-1 Religious Worker → Green Card

- **Pathway:** R-1 visa (religious worker) → EB-4 Special Immigrant Religious Worker → Green card
- **Requirements:** 2 years working for qualifying religious organization abroad, US religious organization sponsors you
- **Timeline:** R-1 (up to 5 years) → EB-4 green card (1-2 years) → Naturalization (5 years)
- **Best for:** If Church of Living Light becomes established with both foreign and US operations
- **Note:** This could pair well with your church strategy -- establish abroad, create US branch, enter as religious worker

---

### Decision Tree: Do I Want Back In?

```
ARE YOU HAPPY OUTSIDE THE US?
       │
       ├── YES → Stay on E-2/B-2 for visits. No action needed.
       │         Your wife's citizenship remains your safety net.
       │
       └── NO → Do you want to LIVE in the US permanently?
                    │
                    ├── NO → E-2 visa is sufficient.
                    │         Live in US part-time, run business.
                    │         Renew indefinitely. No citizenship needed.
                    │
                    └── YES → Do you want US CITIZENSHIP again?
                                 │
                                 ├── NO → Green card via wife's I-130.
                                 │         Permanent resident status.
                                 │         Live and work freely.
                                 │         No need to naturalize.
                                 │
                                 └── YES → Green card via wife's I-130.
                                           Wait 3 years.
                                           Apply for naturalization.
                                           ~4.5-5.5 years total.
```

**The beauty of this structure:** You never have to decide now. The door stays open. Your wife's citizenship is a permanent option that can be exercised 1 year from now, 10 years from now, or never.

### Costs: Return Pathway

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| I-130 filing fee | $535 |
| DS-260 immigrant visa fee | $325 |
| Medical exam | $200-$500 |
| Document translation/apostille | $500-$1,000 |
| Immigration attorney | $3,000-$8,000 |
| USCIS immigrant fee (green card production) | $220 |
| N-400 naturalization filing fee | $710 |
| **Total (green card only)** | **$5,000-$11,000** |
| **Total (through naturalization)** | **$5,700-$11,700** |

Compared to the hundreds of thousands spent on CBI programs and E-2 businesses, the return pathway is remarkably affordable. The real cost is time (4.5-5.5 years) and the resumption of US tax obligations.

**Otherwise, avoid.**

---

### Recommendation for Church

**Phase 1: Informal Operations (2026)**
- Operate Church of Living Light informally
- Develop programs, community, doctrine
- Test different countries/communities
- No legal structure yet

**Phase 2: Choose Jurisdiction (2027)**
Based on where you're actually operating:
- **If primarily Costa Rica/Central America:** Costa Rica Asociación
- **If international/privacy important:** Panama Foundation
- **If expanding to Europe:** Portugal Associação (especially if you get citizenship)
- **If want multiple:** Establish in each major jurisdiction

**Phase 3: Formalize (2027-2028)**
- Establish legal entity in chosen jurisdiction
- Apply for tax-exempt status
- Set up banking
- Create formal structure (board, bylaws, etc.)

**Don't rush.** Let the church grow organically, then formalize in the jurisdiction that makes most sense.

## Key Considerations & Risks

### Risks of Renouncing US Citizenship

**1. Irreversibility**
- Cannot get citizenship back (would have to immigrate like anyone else)
- Permanent decision
- Make sure you're 100% certain

**2. Exit Tax**
- Can be substantial if net worth > $2M
- Must pay tax on unrealized gains
- Locks in tax basis

**3. US Access**
- Lose automatic right to enter US
- Dependent on visa/ESTA with new passport
- Could be denied entry
- Reed Amendment risk (re-entry ban if tax-motivated)

**4. Family Complications**
- Gifting to US family members has limits
- Estate tax issues
- Cannot sponsor family for green cards

**5. US Banking**
- Will lose US bank accounts
- Credit cards terminated
- Harder to do business with US

**6. Some Countries Easier with US Passport**
- A few countries give preferential treatment to US citizens
- Though top-tier passports (EU) compensate

### Risks of Caribbean CBI

**1. Reputation**
- Some view CBI passports as "bought"
- Banking scrutiny (especially Dominica, less so St. Kitts)
- Some countries suspicious

**2. Program Changes**
- Countries can change/end programs
- Investment requirements can increase
- Prices rising over time

**3. Revocation**
- Citizenship can be revoked for:
  - Fraud in application
  - Criminal activity
  - National security
  - Not maintaining investment (if real estate)

**4. Limited Passport Strength**
- No ESTA to USA
- No visa-free Canada
- Not as strong as EU passports

### Risks of E-2 Visa

**1. Business Dependent**
- If business fails, visa ends
- Must actively manage (can't be passive)
- Investment capital at risk

**2. Not Immigrant Visa**
- No path to green card from E-2
- Not permanent residency
- Must maintain Grenada citizenship

**3. Renewal Requirements**
- Must prove business still viable
- Every 5 years must renew
- Could be denied if business struggling

**4. Family Implications**
- Children age out at 21 (lose derivative status)
- Spouse work authorization tied to your E-2

### Tax Considerations

**After Renouncing US Citizenship:**

**Where do you pay taxes?**

Depends on tax residency:

1. **Costa Rica (if tax resident there):**
   - Territorial tax system
   - Only Costa Rica-source income taxed
   - Foreign income NOT taxed
   - Must file returns

2. **Grenada:**
   - No tax on foreign income if you don't live there
   - Only tax residents pay income tax

3. **Paraguay:**
   - Territorial system
   - Foreign income not taxed
   - Only Paraguay-source income taxed

4. **Portugal:**
   - If resident: Worldwide income taxed (unless NHR regime)
   - Non-Habitual Resident (NHR): 10 years of favorable tax treatment
   - If Golden Visa only (not resident): No tax obligation

**Strategic tax planning:**
- Become tax resident in territorial tax country (Costa Rica, Paraguay, Panama)
- Structure income as foreign-source
- Minimize tax burden legally

**Must consult with international tax attorney for your specific situation.**

### Privacy Considerations

**Public Records:**
- Some CBI programs require disclosure to home country
- US has information sharing agreements
- Financial accounts reported via FATCA/CRS

**Banking:**
- FATCA requires banks to report US persons
- After renunciation, not US person anymore
- But CBI passports face enhanced scrutiny

**Recommendation:** Work with privacy-focused advisors on structure.
