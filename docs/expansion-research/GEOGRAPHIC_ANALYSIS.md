## 1. Priority Region Analysis

### A. MEXICO - Comprehensive Analysis

#### Ibogaine Legal Status

**Status: UNREGULATED (Fully Operational)**

Mexico is one of only three countries worldwide where ibogaine remains unregulated (alongside Canada and Portugal). Key points:

- Ibogaine is **not listed** on Mexico's controlled substances schedules
- Legal status is equivalent to over-the-counter natural remedies
- No government regulation or oversight impacts operation
- Ibogaine is **not included** on the UN International Narcotics Control Board's Green List
- Clinics operate openly and legally throughout the country
- **2025 Development**: Texas allocated $50 million for ibogaine clinical research, signaling growing US acceptance

**Regulatory Environment:**
- Lack of formal regulation means clinics operate under their own standards
- No standardized protocols or licensing requirements specific to ibogaine
- This creates both opportunity (flexibility) and responsibility (self-regulation)

---

#### Region: BAJA CALIFORNIA (Tijuana, Rosarito, Ensenada)

**Pros:**
| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| US Proximity | 20-30 minutes from San Diego |
| Airport Access | San Diego International (SAN) - major hub |
| Established Industry | Longest-running ibogaine clinics in Mexico |
| Hospital Access | Multiple hospitals in Tijuana/Rosarito corridor |
| Staff Availability | Large pool of bilingual medical professionals |
| Cost of Operations | Lower than US, moderate for Mexico |

**Cons:**
| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Safety Advisory | **Level 3: Reconsider Travel** (US State Dept) |
| Security Concerns | Border area with documented cartel activity |
| Reputation Risk | Negative associations with border region |
| UK Advisory | Advises against all but essential travel to Tijuana |
| Competitor Saturation | 10+ established ibogaine clinics |

**Medical Infrastructure:**
- Multiple hospitals within 15-minute radius
- Tijuana has extensive medical tourism infrastructure
- Cross-border medical care arrangements with San Diego hospitals

**Real Estate Costs (2025):**
- Residential: MXN 2,600,781 average (USD ~$137,000)
- Commercial/clinic-suitable: Varies significantly by location
- Beachfront luxury in Rosarito: More accessible than Quintana Roo

**Safety Analysis:**
The US State Department notes: "Most homicides appeared to be targeted; however, criminal organization assassinations and territorial disputes can result in bystanders being injured or killed." Violence is concentrated in non-tourist areas, with coastal areas (Rosarito, Ensenada) generally safer than the immediate border zone.

**Existing Clinics in Baja:**
1. Experience Ibogaine Treatment Center (longest-running, Rosarito)
2. Baja Ibogaine Center (luxury, Rosarito Beach)
3. Casa Santa Isabel (only certified clinic with on-site pharmacy/lab, Tijuana)
4. Anzelmo Ibogaine Center (beachfront, gated community)
5. Iboga Treatment Center (extended stay, Ensenada)
6. New Path Ibogaine Center (Baja Coast)

- 99.9% of visits to resort areas occur without incident
- No tourist deaths linked to cartel violence inside Cancun hotel zones in 2025
- US Embassy recommends using Guest Assist mobile app
- Security includes National Guard, Navy, Army, state and local police

**Airport Connectivity:**

### B. COSTA RICA

#### Legal Framework for Plant Medicine

**Status: LEGAL GREY AREA - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR IBOGAINE**

| Substance | Legal Status |
|-----------|--------------|
| Ayahuasca | Unscheduled but DMT is controlled - grey area |
| Psilocybin | Listed on controlled substances (2020 update) but enforcement is lax |
| Ibogaine | Not specifically addressed; DMT restrictions may apply |

**Critical Warning:**
- DMT (active ingredient in ayahuasca) is a controlled substance under Law #8204
- Commercial use of ayahuasca can lead to 8-15 years imprisonment
- Of ~80 plant medicine centers operating, only 3 have licenses
- At least 2 psychedelic-related deaths in past 18 months
- Centers seek to cover up harms due to legal risks

**The Rythmia Model:**
Rythmia Life Advancement Center claims to be "the only medically licensed facility in the world to offer Ayahuasca":
- Licensed by Costa Rica Ministry of Health
- Additional IAFA (drug/alcohol facility management) license
- Licensed by municipality of Santa Cruz, Guanacaste
- Uses plants (Banisteriopsis Caapi, Una De Gato, Mimosa Tenuiflora, Nicotiana Rustica) - NOT traditional ayahuasca
- Medical supervision by licensed Costa Rican physicians

**Medical Infrastructure:**

**San Jose Area (Best in Country):**
- **Hospital CIMA**: 170+ physicians, 60+ specialties, JCI-accredited, US VA accredited
- **Clinica Biblica**: Largest private hospital, $50M infrastructure, 200 physicians
- **Clinica Catolica**: High-quality private care
- **Hospital Clinica UNIBE**: Suburban San Jose

**Healthcare Quality:**
- Many doctors trained in US or Europe
- Significant number speak English fluently (especially private sector)
- Universal healthcare since 1940s (CCSS/Caja system)
- Quality comparable to international standards in private sector

**Business Setup:**
- 100% foreign ownership permitted
- No restrictions on foreign investment in healthcare
- Health permit required from Ministry of Health
- Social charges add ~26% to payroll
- Corporation requires minimum 2 shareholders
- Process typically takes 3-6 weeks with legal assistance

**Real Estate (Guanacaste - Wellness Hub):**
| Location | Price per m2 (USD) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Tamarindo | $966 - $6,302 |
| Playa Potrero | $1,809 - $5,704 |
| Nosara (yoga/wellness hub) | $1,641 - $4,690 |
| Samara | $1,311 - $4,209 |
| Liberia (urban center) | $571 - $2,223 |

Property values have increased up to 400% in 3 years in some Guanacaste areas.

**Visa Requirements:**
- US citizens: No visa for stays up to 90-180 days
- Return ticket and $100/month in funds required

**RECOMMENDATION FOR COSTA RICA:**
**Not recommended for ibogaine operations** due to legal uncertainty. Could be considered for ayahuasca-adjacent offerings following Rythmia model with proper licensing, but significant legal complexity and risk exists.

---

### C. PORTUGAL

#### Drug Decriminalization Framework

**Status: DECRIMINALIZED - OPERATIONAL CLINICS EXIST**

Portugal passed Law 30/2000 (effective July 2001) decriminalizing possession and use of all drugs:

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Personal Possession | Decriminalized (up to 10-day supply) |
| Sale/Distribution | Still illegal (1-15 years imprisonment) |
| Clinical Use | Grey area - clinics operate |
| Ibogaine Specifically | Decriminalized for possession/use |

**What Decriminalization Means:**
- Possession of small amounts (10-day supply) is not criminal
- Does not legalize sale or clinical use
- Creates "potential space for ibogaine integration"
- Tabula Rasa and other clinics operate successfully

**Existing Ibogaine Clinic: Tabula Rasa Retreat**

Located in Alentejo region, Tabula Rasa represents the European ibogaine clinic model:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Alentejo region (also clinics in Sintra) |
| Clientele | UK, Northern Europe, UAE, USA |
| Medical Standards | ACLS-trained staff, medical vetting/monitoring |
| Holistic Offerings | Breathwork, bodywork, massage, meditation, kundalini yoga, reiki, gong baths, drumming circles, equine-assisted therapy, personal training, nutrition |
| Therapy Support | 1:1 counseling, group therapy |
| Director | Alvaro de Ferranti |
| Average Cost | $7,157 - $8,250 |

**Medical System Quality:**
Portugal has excellent medical infrastructure:
- Reorganization into 39 Local Health Units (ULS) in 2024
- Hospital public-private partnerships (PPPs) expanding in 2025
- Must comply with EU rules, CE marking, GDPR
- Standard corporate tax: 21% (17% for small businesses on first EUR 15,000)

**European Client Accessibility:**
- Schengen zone - easy access for all EU citizens
- US citizens: No visa for 90 days (ETIAS required from mid-2025)
- Multiple international airports (Lisbon, Porto, Faro)
- Established medical tourism infrastructure

**Real Estate Costs (2025):**
| Location | Price per m2 (EUR) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Lisbon (city) | 5,914 - 6,934 |
| Lisbon Metro Area | ~4,935 |
| Algarve (average) | 3,400 - 4,385 |
| Luxury Districts (Lisbon, Cascais) | 8,000 - 10,000+ |
| Silver Coast (alternative) | 2,000 - 2,800 |

Prices jumped 15.8% YoY in early 2025 (vs EU average of 4.5%).

**RECOMMENDATION FOR PORTUGAL:**
Excellent for **European client base** and as a second/expansion location. Lower cost than Quintana Roo, established legal precedent with Tabula Rasa, but requires navigating decriminalization (not legalization) framework. Best for clients who cannot or prefer not to travel to Americas.

---

### D. OTHER JURISDICTIONS

#### JAMAICA

**Status: PSILOCYBIN LEGAL (Not specifically for Ibogaine)**

| Substance | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Psilocybin | **LEGAL** - never prohibited under Dangerous Drugs Act |
| Possession/Sale/Cultivation | All legal for psilocybin mushrooms |
| Cannabis | Decriminalized (specific regulations) |
| Ibogaine | Not specifically addressed |

**Government Position:**
- JAMPRO (Jamaica Promotions Corporation) actively encouraging psilocybin industry
- Seeking to position Jamaica as "primary destination for research and development"
- Countries like Jamaica began formal regulation of therapeutic psilocybin services during 2023-2025

**Notable Retreat Centers:**

| Center | Location | Features |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Atman Retreat | Montego Bay Lagoon | 18th-century property, covering physician at Cornwall Regional Hospital, NYU-trained advisors |
| ONE Retreats | Negril | 7-day programs, $4,500, farm-to-table meals |
| Evolution Retreats | Negril | Tensing Pen (highest-rated boutique resort), cliffside Caribbean setting |
| Mycelia | Near Montego Bay | All-inclusive from $3,995, lab-tested mushrooms |
| MycoMeditations | Treasure Beach | Western mental health care standards |
| Beckley Retreats | Jamaica | Science-backed, also operates in Netherlands |

**Medical Infrastructure:**
- Cornwall Regional Hospital (Montego Bay) - general medicine
- St. James Public Health Services
- Limited compared to Mexico; primarily reliant on local hospitals

**US Citizen Access:**
- No visa required for up to 90 days
- Valid passport required
- Direct flights from major US cities to Montego Bay (MBJ) and Kingston (KIN)

**RECOMMENDATION FOR JAMAICA:**
**Excellent for psilocybin-focused programs** but not established for ibogaine. Could serve as complementary location for psilocybin offerings while Mexico handles ibogaine. Strong legal clarity for psilocybin is significant advantage.

---

#### BAHAMAS

**Status: PSILOCYBIN & IBOGAINE ACCESSIBLE**

| Substance | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Psilocybin | **LEGAL** - not on Dangerous Drugs list |
| Ibogaine | Reportedly accessible at resorts |
| 5-MeO-DMT | Reportedly accessible |

**Unique Position:**
- Only Caribbean location where both psilocybin AND ibogaine are accessible
- Multiple resorts offer comprehensive psychedelic services
- Not just psilocybin-only like Jamaica

**Notable Centers:**

| Center | Services | Features |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Avante Institute | Ibogaine, psychedelic-assisted therapy | Decade+ experience, addiction/depression/PTSD/GAD treatment, luxury facilities |
| Oceanside Treatment Center | Ibogaine + Psilocybin | 5/7/14-day programs, cardiac monitoring, residential setting |
| Psilocybin Therapy Bahamas | Psilocybin | Multi-day retreat, therapist support |

**Advantages:**
- Proximity to US (short flights from Florida)
- English-speaking
- Established tourism infrastructure
- Both ibogaine and psilocybin under one jurisdiction

**Limitations:**
- Sales technically prohibited under UN Convention
- Limited medical infrastructure compared to Mexico
- Hurricane risk

**RECOMMENDATION FOR BAHAMAS:**
**Strong alternative to Mexico** for operations serving US East Coast clients. Unique in offering both ibogaine and psilocybin legally. Would require careful due diligence on specific regulatory compliance but represents genuine opportunity.

---

#### NETHERLANDS

**Status: PSILOCYBIN TRUFFLES LEGAL (Not Mushrooms)**

| Substance | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Psilocybin Mushrooms | Banned since 2008 |
| Psilocybin Truffles | **LEGAL** (sold in smart shops) |
| Ibogaine | Available in smart shops |
| Ayahuasca | Illegal even for religious use |
| 5-MeO-DMT | Available |
| Cacti (mescaline) | Available |

**Operational Landscape:**

**Notable Retreats:**
- Beckley Retreats (psilocybin)
- Tangerine Retreat
- Inner Shift Institute
- Experiential Training Institute
- Elevated Mind Retreats

**RECOMMENDATION FOR NETHERLANDS:**
Suitable for **psilocybin truffle programs** serving European clients. Cannot make medical claims, which limits luxury medical positioning. More appropriate for spiritual/wellness-focused rather than clinical operations.

---

#### GUATEMALA

**Status: UNCERTAIN - NOT RECOMMENDED**

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Ayahuasca | Falls under "Law Against Drug Activity" - uncertain |
| Legal Framework | Prohibits substances altering physiological functions |
| Enforcement | Not explicitly mentioned, creates grey area |
| Ibogaine | Not specifically addressed |

**RECOMMENDATION:** Not recommended due to legal uncertainty and inferior infrastructure compared to alternatives.

---

#### PANAMA

**Status: ILLEGAL - NOT RECOMMENDED**

| Substance | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Ayahuasca/DMT | **Illegal** |
| All Psychedelics | Illegal (except medical cannabis under Law 242) |
| MDMA | Illegal (2-15 years imprisonment) |
| Ketamine | Illegal (not expected to decriminalize soon) |

**Exception:** Government turns blind eye to indigenous peoples' traditional use in their own legal jurisdictions.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Not recommended for commercial operations.

---

#### THAILAND

**Status: RESEARCH ONLY (2024 Changes)**

| Substance | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Psilocybin | Category 5 narcotic - illegal for general use |
| Cannabis | Re-criminalized June 2025 (medical only with prescription) |
| Kratom | **LEGAL** since 2021, heavily promoted |

**2024 Regulatory Change:**
- Ministerial Notification (April 23, 2024) allows psilocybin for medical treatment and research
- Still requires extensive process: FDA approval, no imports allowed
- Not yet operational for commercial treatment

**RECOMMENDATION:** Monitor for future developments but not currently viable for commercial plant medicine operations.
