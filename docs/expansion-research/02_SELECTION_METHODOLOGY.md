# Location Selection Methodology & Criteria

> *Comprehensive Framework for Global Facility Site Selection*

---

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic methodology for evaluating and selecting locations for Transformational Epicenter facilities worldwide. The framework ensures consistent, data-driven decision-making while accounting for the unique requirements of our integrated four-pillar model.

---

## Part 1: The Selection Framework

### 1.1 Evaluation Philosophy

Our location selection methodology is built on three foundational principles:

1. **Safety First**: No compromise on medical infrastructure and guest security
2. **Market Alignment**: Locations must serve identifiable UHNW populations
3. **Operational Viability**: Sustainable business model with manageable risk

### 1.2 Five-Stage Evaluation Process
