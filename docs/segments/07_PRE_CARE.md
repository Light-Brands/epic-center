# Segment 7: Pre-Care (Preparation)

> *Readiness is the foundation of transformation*

---

## The Continuum of Care

A retreat is not an event - it is a phase within a longer arc of transformation. Without proper preparation, guests arrive unprepared. Without proper integration, insights fade. The retreat itself is perhaps 10% of the transformation; the other 90% happens before and after.

Pre-care is where transformation begins. The work done before arrival determines the depth of what's possible during the retreat.

## Purpose

Pre-care ensures guests arrive:
- **Medically cleared** and safe
- **Psychologically prepared** for the experience
- **Intention-clear** about their purpose
- **Nervous system primed** for transformation
- **Logistically organized** for full presence
- **Relationally connected** to their care team

Pre-care is not administrative overhead - it is the foundation of safe, profound transformation.
