# Quintana Roo Property Evaluation Framework

> *Systematic Criteria for Flagship Location Selection*

---

## Purpose

This framework provides a structured methodology for evaluating specific properties in Quintana Roo, Mexico for the Transformational Epicenter flagship facility. Each property will be scored across 10 categories totaling 100 points, with clear pass/fail gates and weighted criteria aligned with operational requirements.

---

## Part 1: Pass/Fail Gates (Must Pass ALL)

Before detailed scoring, each property must pass these non-negotiable requirements:

| Gate | Requirement | Verification Method | Pass/Fail |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **G1: Hospital Access** | JCI hospital reachable within 30 minutes (non-traffic) | Google Maps + physical drive test | |
| **G2: Cardiac Capability** | Hospital has cardiac catheterization lab | Hospital verification call | |
| **G3: Minimum Capacity** | ≥5 existing bedrooms OR space for 8+ guest rooms | Property inspection | |
| **G4: Zoning** | Permits residential, hospitality, or medical use | Municipal zoning verification | |
| **G5: Security Zone** | Not in US Level 3/4 advisory micro-zone | State Dept + local assessment | |
| **G6: Legal Title** | Clear title, no encumbrances, foreign ownership permitted | Legal counsel review | |
| **G7: Utilities** | Reliable power, water, internet available | Utility company verification | |
| **G8: Access Road** | Paved road access, ambulance accessible | Physical inspection | |
| **G9: Structural Integrity** | Building structurally sound for conversion | Engineer assessment | |

**Scoring Rule:** If ANY gate fails, property is disqualified. Do not proceed to detailed scoring.

## Part 6: Specific Area Guidance (Quintana Roo)

### Optimal Zones (Prioritize)

| Area | Pros | Cons | Hospital Access |
|------|------|------|-----------------|
| **Puerto Morelos** | Quiet, authentic, central | Smaller amenities | Cancun hospitals 25-35 min |
| **Playa del Carmen North** | Full services, good access | More developed | Hospital Playa 10 min, Cancun 45 min |
| **Playacar** | Gated, upscale, established | Expensive | Hospital Playa 5-10 min |

### Acceptable Zones (Consider)

| Area | Pros | Cons | Hospital Access |
|------|------|------|-----------------|
| **Akumal** | Beautiful, cenotes, tranquil | Further from hospitals | Cancun 50-60 min |
| **Playa del Carmen South** | Good value, developing | Less established | Hospital Playa 15-20 min |

### Emerging Zones (Requires Verification)

| Area | Pros | Cons | Hospital Access |
|------|------|------|-----------------|
| **Tulum** | Tulum Airport now operational, Tren Maya connectivity, wellness reputation, cenotes, spiritual positioning | ⚠️ **MUST VERIFY hospital access** - Need JCI-quality hospital with cardiac cath lab ≤30 min | **TO BE VERIFIED** - Hospital Joya expanding? New facilities? |

**Tulum Status Update (January 2026):**
- ✅ **Tulum International Airport (TQO)** - Now operational, direct flights available
- ✅ **Tren Maya** - Active, connects Tulum to Cancun and other cities
- ⚠️ **Hospital Infrastructure** - CRITICAL GAP TO VERIFY:
  - Is there a JCI-quality hospital with cardiac catheterization within 30 minutes?
  - Hospital Joya was expanding to Tulum - current status?
  - What is actual ambulance response time?
  - Is helicopter evacuation to Cancun viable (<20 min)?

**If hospital access can be verified ≤30 min to cardiac capability, Tulum moves to "Optimal Zones"**

The combination of:
- International airport (guest convenience)
- Tren Maya (staff/supply chain connectivity)
- Wellness destination reputation (brand alignment)
- Cenotes and natural beauty (healing environment)
- Lower density than Playa del Carmen (privacy)

...makes Tulum potentially the **best location IF medical infrastructure is confirmed**.

### Avoid Zones

| Area | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Hotel Zone Cancun** | Too commercial, no privacy, expensive |
| **Far South (Sian Ka'an)** | Too remote, limited medical access |
