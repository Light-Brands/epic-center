## Financial Model Analysis (January 25, 2026)

> **Data synced from Google Sheets master model.** The 5-year financial model reveals that only 2 of 4 properties are financially viable. Low acquisition cost does NOT equal good investment.

### Investment Returns Summary

| Property | Total Investment | Cost/Room | IRR (Base) | MOIC | Viable? |
|----------|------------------|-----------|------------|------|---------|
| **Hotel Alea Tulum** | $19,036,750 | $906,512 | **29.54%** | 2.61x | ✅ YES |
| **Hacienda Caracol** | $13,914,000 | $1,391,400 | **18%** | 1.85x | ✅ YES |

### Revenue & Pricing Analysis

| Property | Daily Rate | Target Market | Avg Revenue/Guest | Year 5 Revenue | 5-Year Total |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Hotel Alea Tulum** | $2,321 | HNW | $48,138 | $15.3M | $62.1M |
| **Hacienda Caracol** | $3,157 | **U-HNW** | $65,476 | $7.9M | $32.3M |
| Casa Sueño de Mar | $2,321 | HNW | $39,457 | N/A | N/A |
| Mini Hotel Cancún | $2,321 | HNW | $39,457 | N/A | N/A |

### Operating Economics

| Property | Monthly Fixed Costs | Annual Fixed | Usable Beds | Max Guests/Year | Break-even |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Hotel Alea Tulum** | $343,500 | $4.12M | 17 | 310 | 42% |
| **Hacienda Caracol** | $210,000 | $2.52M | 8 | 146 | 38% |
| Mini Hotel Cancún | $280,000 | $3.36M | 16 | 292 | ~55% |
| Casa Sueño de Mar | $225,000 | $2.70M | 6 | 110 | ~70% |

### Profitability Comparison (Year 5 Base Case)

| Property | Revenue | EBITDA | EBITDA Margin | Net Income |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Hotel Alea Tulum** | $15.3M | $6.0M | 39% | $3.6M |
| **Hacienda Caracol** | $7.9M | $3.8M | 48% | $2.3M |
| Casa Sueño de Mar | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Mini Hotel Cancún | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Why Mini Hotel Cancún Fails Financially

Despite the lowest acquisition cost ($1.1M) and highest property score (79/100):

1. **Brand Disconnect = No Pricing Power**: Urban location cannot command premium wellness pricing
2. **Operating Cost Burden**: $280K/month fixed costs with no differentiation
3. **Revenue Ceiling**: Standard HNW pricing ($2,321/day) insufficient for urban property costs
4. **Negative Cash Flows**: All 5 years show losses before exit consideration
5. **Even with Exit**: Best-case (aggressive) scenario still shows -11% IRR

**Lesson:** A cheap property that doesn't fit the brand is more expensive than an expensive property that does.

### Why Casa Sueño de Mar Fails Financially

1. **Capacity Constraint**: Only 6 usable beds = 106 max guests/year
2. **High Break-even**: Need ~70% occupancy just to cover fixed costs
3. **Zoning Risk**: Residential HOA likely prohibits commercial use
4. **No Scale Economics**: $225K/month costs spread over too few guests
5. **Marginal Returns**: Even aggressive scenario only 8.26% IRR

### Why Hotel Alea Tulum Leads

Despite higher total investment ($19M vs $13.9M for Hacienda Caracol):

1. **Scale Advantage**: 21 rooms generates $62.1M 5-year revenue vs $32.3M
2. **Proven Operations**: Already operating as 4-star boutique hotel
3. **Lower Cost/Room**: $906K vs $1.39M for Hacienda Caracol
4. **Higher Absolute Returns**: 29.54% IRR with 2.61x MOIC
5. **HNW Volume**: Larger addressable market at HNW tier

### Why Hacienda Caracol is a Strong #2

Despite lower IRR (18% vs 29.54%):

1. **U-HNW Positioning**: 1.36x pricing multiplier ($3,157/day) justified by exclusivity
2. **Higher Gross Margins**: 82% vs 72% for Hotel Alea
3. **Lower Operating Costs**: $210K/month vs $343K for Hotel Alea
4. **Intimate Scale**: 8 beds creates scarcity and premium value
5. **Tiered Strategy**: Complements Hotel Alea for dual-market coverage
6. **Faster Break-even**: 38% vs 42% occupancy threshold

### Updated Property Rankings

| Rank | Property | Financial Viability | Brand Fit | Overall |
|------|----------|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| **1** | **Hotel Alea Tulum** | ✅ 29.54% IRR, 2.61x MOIC | ✅ Perfect | **TOP CHOICE (HNW Flagship)** |
| **2** | **Hacienda Caracol** | ✅ 18% IRR, 1.85x MOIC | ✅ Perfect | **STRONG (U-HNW Tier)** |
| 3 | Casa Sueño de Mar | ❌ 2% IRR | ❌ Poor | Not viable |
| 4 | Mini Hotel Cancún | ❌ -15% IRR | ❌ Poor | Not viable |

### Qualitative Assessment

| Factor | Mini Hotel | Hotel Alea | Hacienda Caracol | Casa Sueño |
|--------|------------|------------|------------------|------------|

## Recommendation Summary (Updated with Financial Model)

### ✅ TOP CANDIDATE: Hacienda Caracol (UHNW Tier)

**Financial Performance:** 29.88% Base IRR | $13.9M Total Investment

**Why This Property Wins:**
- **UHNW positioning unlocks premium pricing** ($3,157/day vs $2,321 HNW)
- **Lower operating costs** ($210K/month) = faster break-even
- **Intimate exclusivity** (8 beds) creates scarcity value
- Perfect brand alignment (beachfront, maximum privacy)
- Same medical infrastructure challenges as Hotel Alea (solvable)

**Investment Profile:**
- Total Investment: $13,914,000
- 5-Year IRR (with exit): 29.88%
- Target Market: Ultra High Net Worth Individuals

**Critical Contingency:** Same as Hotel Alea - must resolve hospital access gap.

---

### ✅ STRONG SECOND: Hotel Alea Tulum (HNW Flagship)

**Financial Performance:** 28.51% Base IRR | $19.0M Total Investment

**Why Still Excellent:**
- 21 rooms = highest revenue potential ($15.1M Year 5)
- Operating hotel reduces conversion risk
- Tier 1 flagship capacity
- Perfect natural environment + maximum privacy

**Investment Profile:**
- Total Investment: $19,036,750
- 5-Year IRR (with exit): 28.51%
- Target Market: High Net Worth Individuals

**Trade-off vs Hacienda Caracol:**
- Higher total investment ($19M vs $14M)
- Slightly lower IRR (28.5% vs 30%)
- But 2.5x the capacity and revenue scale

**Recommendation:** Could pursue BOTH - Hacienda Caracol as UHNW boutique, Hotel Alea as HNW flagship.

---

### ❌ PASS: Mini Hotel Cancún

**Financial Performance:** -20.00% Base IRR | $10.7M Total Investment

**Why Financially Non-Viable:**
- Despite lowest acquisition cost ($1.1M), returns are deeply negative
- Urban location = no pricing premium possible
- Brand misalignment destroys value proposition
- Even aggressive scenario shows -11% IRR

**Key Lesson:** Cheap acquisition ≠ good investment. Brand fit is the multiplier.

**Alternative Use Only:** Administrative/back-office hub if needed.

---

### ❌ PASS: Casa Sueño de Mar

**Financial Performance:** 1.13% Base IRR | $11.5M Total Investment

**Why Financially Non-Viable:**
- Only 6 usable beds = insufficient scale
- 70% occupancy needed just to break even
- Residential zoning likely blocks commercial use
- Golf community atmosphere doesn't support brand

**Developer Meeting Note:** Only worth exploring if developer offers commercial-zoned land for new-build.

### Question 2: What Hospital IS Available in Tulum?

**FINDING: Hospital Costamed Tulum is the only private hospital in Tulum.**

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 24/7 Emergency | ✅ Yes |
| ICU | ✅ Yes - Advanced technology, Total Care beds |
| Cardiac Life Support | ✅ Staff ACLS certified |
| Cardiac Catheterization | ❌ **NO** - Complex cardiac cases transfer out |

**Source:** [Hospital Costamed Tulum](https://www.costamed.com.mx/en/hospital/tulum)

---

### Question 3: Nearest Cardiac Cath Lab?

**FINDING: Galenia Hospital Cancún - 70-80 minutes by ground from Tulum**

| Hospital | Distance from Tulum | Cardiac Cath | JCI |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|-----|
| **Galenia Hospital** (Cancún) | 70-80 min | ✅ **YES** - Full hemodynamics lab | ✅ JCI Level 5 |

- Stenting, angioplasty, full cardiovascular surgery unit
- 24/7 availability

**Source:** [Galenia Hospital](https://hospitalgalenia.com/en/)

---

### Question 4: Helicopter Evacuation Feasibility

**FINDING: Possible but NOT ideal - no local HEMS base**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Helicopter flight time Tulum → Cancún | **35-50 minutes** |
| Local helicopter ambulance base | ❌ **NO** - Nearest HEMS is Mexico City |
| Fixed-wing air ambulance | ✅ Available - Jet Rescue Air serves Cancún |
| Response time (fixed-wing) | ~3 hours from payment secured |
| Commercial helicopter transfers | ✅ Available - $2,250-4,750 USD |

**Key Providers:**
- **[Jet Rescue Air](https://www.jetrescueairambulance.com/)** - Only air ambulance based in Cancún region
  - Fleet: 10 medical jets, 1 helicopter (based in Mexico City)
  - HEMS helicopter operates within 90-mile radius of Mexico City (does NOT cover Riviera Maya)
  - Can respond to Cancún with fixed-wing in ~3 hours

- **[Helikan](https://www.helikan.com/)** - Commercial helicopter transfers
  - Tulum to Cancún: 50 min, ~$4,750
  - NOT a medical service - scenic/VIP transfers only

- **[Aeromed](https://www.mexicoairambulance.com/mexico)** - International air ambulance
  - Serves Riviera Maya for evacuation to US/international

**CRITICAL GAP:** No physician-staffed helicopter emergency service covers Tulum. Closest HEMS is 90+ miles away in Mexico City.

---

### Question 5: Can the Hospital Gap Be Solved?

**ASSESSMENT: Partially - requires multi-layer approach**

| Solution | Feasibility | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wait for Hospital Joya Tulum | ⚠️ Unknown | No timeline, could be years |
| Helicopter evacuation protocol | ⚠️ Partial | 35-50 min flight + no local HEMS base |
| Enhanced on-site capability | ✅ Feasible | On-site ICU + physician can stabilize |
| Ground ambulance to Cancún | ⚠️ Marginal | 70-80 min exceeds 30-min gate requirement |

**Recommended Protocol (if proceeding with Tulum property):**

1. **On-Site ICU Capability (REQUIRED)**
   - 2-4 bed ICU with cardiac monitoring
   - 24/7 physician with ACLS certification
   - Defibrillator, crash cart, stabilization equipment
   - Estimated cost: $500K-1M setup + $300K+/year staffing

2. **Pre-Arranged Air Evacuation (REQUIRED)**
   - Contract with Jet Rescue Air or similar
   - Pre-positioned authorization for rapid dispatch
   - Estimated cost: $50K-100K/year retainer + per-use fees

3. **Helicopter Landing Zone (REQUIRED)**
   - Beach landing or on-property helipad
   - Coordinate with commercial helicopter services for emergency use
   - Estimated cost: $150-300K for formal helipad

4. **Hospital Partnership (RECOMMENDED)**
   - Pre-admission agreement with Galenia Hospital
   - Direct communication line with ER/cardiology
   - Shared patient records system

**Total Additional Investment for Medical Gap Mitigation: $700K-1.5M setup + $400K+/year ongoing**

---

### Updated Gate Assessment for Tulum Properties

With research complete, here is the updated gate status:

| Gate | Original Assessment | Updated Assessment |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| G1: Hospital ≤30 min | ⚠️ CRITICAL | ❌ **FAILS** - Costamed Tulum lacks cardiac cath, Cancún is 70+ min |
| G2: Cardiac Cath Lab | ⚠️ CRITICAL | ❌ **FAILS** - Nearest is Galenia Cancún (70-80 min) |

**HOWEVER:** The framework allows for mitigation through:
- Enhanced on-site capability
- Helicopter evacuation protocol
- Hospital partnership agreements

**Revised recommendation:** Tulum properties can proceed IF:
1. $700K-1.5M additional investment in medical infrastructure is acceptable
2. Ongoing $400K+/year medical operations cost is budgeted
3. Risk acceptance for 35-50 min helicopter evacuation time (vs. 30 min ground target)

---

## Revised Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. ~~**URGENT: Verify Hospital Joya Tulum Status**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED: Not operational, no timeline**

2. ~~**Research Helicopter Evacuation Options**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED: 35-50 min flight, no local HEMS**

3. **NEW: Financial Decision Required**
   - Is $700K-1.5M additional medical infrastructure investment acceptable?
   - Is $400K+/year ongoing medical operations cost within budget?
   - Is 35-50 min helicopter evacuation (vs 30 min ground) acceptable risk?

4. **NEW: Contact Jet Rescue Air**
   - Request quote for retainer/on-call agreement
   - Discuss response time guarantees for Tulum area
   - Contact: [Jet Rescue Air - Cancun](https://www.jetrescueairambulance.com/cancun-air-ambulance)

5. **NEW: Contact Galenia Hospital**
   - Discuss partnership/pre-admission agreement
   - Understand their capacity for emergency transfers
   - Contact: [Galenia Hospital](https://hospitalgalenia.com/en/)

### If Medical Investment Is Approved

6. **Schedule Site Visit: Hotel Alea Tulum**
   - Physical inspection of property
   - Assess ICU/helipad build-out locations
   - Meet with current ownership
   - Test actual drive times to Costamed Tulum

7. **Initiate Due Diligence**
   - Title search (10+ years)
   - Zoning confirmation for medical facility
   - Environmental assessment
   - Financial review (current operations)

### Alternative Track

8. **Explore Puerto Morelos / Playa del Carmen North**
   - These locations are 30-45 min from Cancún hospitals
   - May meet G1/G2 gates without additional medical investment
   - Trade-off: Less "healing atmosphere" than Tulum

---

## Key Insight: The Tulum Trade-Off

All evaluated properties reveal a fundamental trade-off in Quintana Roo:

| Location | Medical Access | Brand Alignment | Resolution |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Cancún** | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Poor | Urban environment unsuitable for healing brand |
| **Tulum** | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent | Must solve hospital gap through helicopter + on-site capability |
| **Puerto Morelos/Playa** | ⚠️ Good | ⚠️ Moderate | Best compromise - may sacrifice some natural beauty |

**The framework correctly identified this:** Tulum is potentially the BEST location IF medical infrastructure can be verified/established.

**Research Conclusion:** Hospital Joya Tulum does not exist yet, and there is no local helicopter ambulance service. However, the gap CAN be mitigated through:
- Enhanced on-site ICU capability
- Pre-arranged helicopter evacuation (35-50 min to Cancún)
- Partnership with Galenia Hospital

**Updated Recommendation:**
- If additional $700K-1.5M capital + $400K/year operations cost is acceptable → **Proceed with Hotel Alea Tulum**
- If not → **Pivot to Puerto Morelos/Playa del Carmen North** properties that meet hospital gates without mitigation

## Strategic Recommendation

### Dual-Property Strategy

The financial model suggests a powerful dual-property approach:

| Property | Role | Investment | IRR | Target |
|----------|------|------------|-----|--------|
| **Hacienda Caracol** | UHNW Boutique | $13.9M | 30% | Ultra High Net Worth |
| **Hotel Alea Tulum** | HNW Flagship | $19.0M | 29% | High Net Worth |
| **Combined** | Full Portfolio | $32.9M | ~29% | Complete Market Coverage |

**Benefits of Dual-Property Approach:**
1. **Market Segmentation**: Capture both UHNW and HNW clientele
2. **Risk Diversification**: Two properties, two price points
3. **Operational Synergies**: Shared medical infrastructure investment
4. **Brand Ladder**: Guests can upgrade from HNW to UHNW tier
5. **Total Capacity**: 25 usable beds (8 + 17) = 464 guests/year potential

### Next Steps

1. **Resolve Medical Infrastructure** (applies to both properties)
   - Contact Jet Rescue Air for evacuation agreement
   - Partner with Galenia Hospital Cancún
   - Budget $700K-1.5M additional medical investment

2. **Prioritize Acquisition Order**
   - Option A: Hacienda Caracol first (lower capital, faster to market)
   - Option B: Hotel Alea first (higher capacity, establishes brand)
   - Option C: Parallel acquisition (if capital available)

3. **Proceed with Site Visits**
   - Hacienda Caracol: Verify beachfront access, helipad feasibility
   - Hotel Alea Tulum: Assess current operations, staff retention
