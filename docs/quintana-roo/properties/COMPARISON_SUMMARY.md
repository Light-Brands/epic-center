## Recommendation Summary

### ✅ SHORTLIST: Hotel Alea Tulum

**Why:** Best overall alignment with brand vision. Offers:
- 21 rooms (Tier 1 capacity)
- Perfect natural environment
- Maximum privacy
- Operating hotel infrastructure
- Tulum airport now operational

**Critical Contingency:** Must resolve hospital access gap through:
1. Verify Hospital Joya Tulum cardiac capability
2. Establish helicopter evacuation protocol
3. Enhanced on-site medical capability

**If hospital access can be solved, this is the TOP CANDIDATE.**

---

### ⏸️ HOLD: Hacienda Caracol

**Why:** Strong secondary option with similar brand qualities to Hotel Alea, but:
- Lower capacity (10 vs 21 rooms)
- Higher cost per room ($1.45M vs $928K)
- Vacation rental vs operating hotel (more conversion risk)

**Best for:** Tier 2 or "ultra-private" facility if smaller, more exclusive tier added to strategy.

**Hold until:** Hotel Alea outcome determined.

---

### ❌ PASS: Mini Hotel Cancún

**Why:** Despite highest quantitative score (79/100), the qualitative assessment is disqualifying:
- Urban location incompatible with healing retreat brand
- No natural features, limited privacy
- Zero strategic fit score

**Potential alternative use:** Administrative hub, guest check-in point, or staff facility (NOT primary treatment center).

---

### ❌ PASS: Casa Sueño de Mar

**Why:** Fundamental failures:
- Residential gated community prohibits commercial medical use
- Insufficient capacity (7 rooms)
- Highest cost per room ($1.7M)
- Poor brand alignment

**Developer meeting note:** If developer offers commercial-zoned land or different property type, evaluate separately.

## Critical Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **URGENT: Verify Hospital Joya Tulum Status**
   - Does it have JCI accreditation or equivalent?
   - Is cardiac catheterization capability available?
   - What is actual ambulance response time?

2. **Research Helicopter Evacuation Options**
   - Contact air ambulance services in Riviera Maya
   - Determine flight time Tulum → Cancún JCI hospitals
   - Assess helicopter landing feasibility at Hotel Alea/Hacienda Caracol

### If Hospital Access Can Be Resolved

3. **Schedule Site Visit: Hotel Alea Tulum**
   - Physical inspection of property
   - Meet with current ownership
   - Assess conversion requirements
   - Test actual drive times

4. **Initiate Due Diligence**
   - Title search (10+ years)
   - Zoning confirmation
   - Environmental assessment
   - Financial review (current operations)

### Parallel Tracks

5. **Continue Property Search**
   - Focus on Puerto Morelos (better hospital access)
   - Explore Playa del Carmen North options
   - Look for properties with hospital proximity AND natural setting

## Key Insight: The Tulum Trade-Off

All evaluated properties reveal a fundamental trade-off in Quintana Roo:

| Location | Medical Access | Brand Alignment | Resolution |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Cancún** | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Poor | Urban environment unsuitable for healing brand |
| **Tulum** | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent | Must solve hospital gap through helicopter + on-site capability |
| **Puerto Morelos/Playa** | ⚠️ Good | ⚠️ Moderate | Best compromise - may sacrifice some natural beauty |

**The framework correctly identified this:** Tulum is potentially the BEST location IF medical infrastructure can be verified/established.

**Recommendation:** Aggressively pursue Hospital Joya Tulum verification and helicopter evacuation protocol. If solvable, Tulum (Hotel Alea specifically) moves to the top of the list.
