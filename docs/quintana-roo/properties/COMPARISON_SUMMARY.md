---

## Recommendation Summary

### ✅ SHORTLIST: Hotel Alea Tulum

**Why:** Best overall alignment with brand vision. Offers:
- 21 rooms (Tier 1 capacity)
- Perfect natural environment
- Maximum privacy
- Operating hotel infrastructure
- Tulum airport now operational

**Critical Contingency:** Must resolve hospital access gap through:
1. Verify Hospital Joya Tulum cardiac capability
2. Establish helicopter evacuation protocol
3. Enhanced on-site medical capability

**If hospital access can be solved, this is the TOP CANDIDATE.**

---

### ⏸️ HOLD: Hacienda Caracol

**Why:** Strong secondary option with similar brand qualities to Hotel Alea, but:
- Lower capacity (10 vs 21 rooms)
- Higher cost per room ($1.45M vs $928K)
- Vacation rental vs operating hotel (more conversion risk)

**Best for:** Tier 2 or "ultra-private" facility if smaller, more exclusive tier added to strategy.

**Hold until:** Hotel Alea outcome determined.

---

### ❌ PASS: Mini Hotel Cancún

**Why:** Despite highest quantitative score (79/100), the qualitative assessment is disqualifying:
- Urban location incompatible with healing retreat brand
- No natural features, limited privacy
- Zero strategic fit score

**Potential alternative use:** Administrative hub, guest check-in point, or staff facility (NOT primary treatment center).

---

### ❌ PASS: Casa Sueño de Mar

**Why:** Fundamental failures:
- Residential gated community prohibits commercial medical use
- Insufficient capacity (7 rooms)
- Highest cost per room ($1.7M)
- Poor brand alignment

**Developer meeting note:** If developer offers commercial-zoned land or different property type, evaluate separately.

### Question 2: What Hospital IS Available in Tulum?

**FINDING: Hospital Costamed Tulum is the only private hospital in Tulum.**

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 24/7 Emergency | ✅ Yes |
| ICU | ✅ Yes - Advanced technology, Total Care beds |
| Cardiac Life Support | ✅ Staff ACLS certified |
| Cardiac Catheterization | ❌ **NO** - Complex cardiac cases transfer out |

**Source:** [Hospital Costamed Tulum](https://www.costamed.com.mx/en/hospital/tulum)

---

### Question 3: Nearest Cardiac Cath Lab?

**FINDING: Galenia Hospital Cancún - 70-80 minutes by ground from Tulum**

| Hospital | Distance from Tulum | Cardiac Cath | JCI |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|-----|
| **Galenia Hospital** (Cancún) | 70-80 min | ✅ **YES** - Full hemodynamics lab | ✅ JCI Level 5 |

### Question 4: Helicopter Evacuation Feasibility

**FINDING: Possible but NOT ideal - no local HEMS base**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Helicopter flight time Tulum → Cancún | **35-50 minutes** |
| Local helicopter ambulance base | ❌ **NO** - Nearest HEMS is Mexico City |
| Fixed-wing air ambulance | ✅ Available - Jet Rescue Air serves Cancún |
| Response time (fixed-wing) | ~3 hours from payment secured |
| Commercial helicopter transfers | ✅ Available - $2,250-4,750 USD |

**Key Providers:**
- **[Jet Rescue Air](https://www.jetrescueairambulance.com/)** - Only air ambulance based in Cancún region
  - Fleet: 10 medical jets, 1 helicopter (based in Mexico City)
  - HEMS helicopter operates within 90-mile radius of Mexico City (does NOT cover Riviera Maya)
  - Can respond to Cancún with fixed-wing in ~3 hours

- **[Helikan](https://www.helikan.com/)** - Commercial helicopter transfers
  - Tulum to Cancún: 50 min, ~$4,750
  - NOT a medical service - scenic/VIP transfers only

- **[Aeromed](https://www.mexicoairambulance.com/mexico)** - International air ambulance
  - Serves Riviera Maya for evacuation to US/international

**CRITICAL GAP:** No physician-staffed helicopter emergency service covers Tulum. Closest HEMS is 90+ miles away in Mexico City.

---

### Question 5: Can the Hospital Gap Be Solved?

**ASSESSMENT: Partially - requires multi-layer approach**

| Solution | Feasibility | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wait for Hospital Joya Tulum | ⚠️ Unknown | No timeline, could be years |
| Helicopter evacuation protocol | ⚠️ Partial | 35-50 min flight + no local HEMS base |
| Enhanced on-site capability | ✅ Feasible | On-site ICU + physician can stabilize |
| Ground ambulance to Cancún | ⚠️ Marginal | 70-80 min exceeds 30-min gate requirement |

**Recommended Protocol (if proceeding with Tulum property):**

1. **On-Site ICU Capability (REQUIRED)**
   - 2-4 bed ICU with cardiac monitoring
   - 24/7 physician with ACLS certification
   - Defibrillator, crash cart, stabilization equipment
   - Estimated cost: $500K-1M setup + $300K+/year staffing

2. **Pre-Arranged Air Evacuation (REQUIRED)**
   - Contract with Jet Rescue Air or similar
   - Pre-positioned authorization for rapid dispatch
   - Estimated cost: $50K-100K/year retainer + per-use fees

3. **Helicopter Landing Zone (REQUIRED)**
   - Beach landing or on-property helipad
   - Coordinate with commercial helicopter services for emergency use
   - Estimated cost: $150-300K for formal helipad

4. **Hospital Partnership (RECOMMENDED)**
   - Pre-admission agreement with Galenia Hospital
   - Direct communication line with ER/cardiology
   - Shared patient records system

**Total Additional Investment for Medical Gap Mitigation: $700K-1.5M setup + $400K+/year ongoing**

### Updated Gate Assessment for Tulum Properties

With research complete, here is the updated gate status:

| Gate | Original Assessment | Updated Assessment |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| G1: Hospital ≤30 min | ⚠️ CRITICAL | ❌ **FAILS** - Costamed Tulum lacks cardiac cath, Cancún is 70+ min |
| G2: Cardiac Cath Lab | ⚠️ CRITICAL | ❌ **FAILS** - Nearest is Galenia Cancún (70-80 min) |

**HOWEVER:** The framework allows for mitigation through:
- Enhanced on-site capability
- Helicopter evacuation protocol
- Hospital partnership agreements

**Revised recommendation:** Tulum properties can proceed IF:
1. $700K-1.5M additional investment in medical infrastructure is acceptable
2. Ongoing $400K+/year medical operations cost is budgeted
3. Risk acceptance for 35-50 min helicopter evacuation time (vs. 30 min ground target)

---

## Revised Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. ~~**URGENT: Verify Hospital Joya Tulum Status**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED: Not operational, no timeline**

2. ~~**Research Helicopter Evacuation Options**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED: 35-50 min flight, no local HEMS**

3. **NEW: Financial Decision Required**
   - Is $700K-1.5M additional medical infrastructure investment acceptable?
   - Is $400K+/year ongoing medical operations cost within budget?
   - Is 35-50 min helicopter evacuation (vs 30 min ground) acceptable risk?

4. **NEW: Contact Jet Rescue Air**
   - Request quote for retainer/on-call agreement
   - Discuss response time guarantees for Tulum area
   - Contact: [Jet Rescue Air - Cancun](https://www.jetrescueairambulance.com/cancun-air-ambulance)

5. **NEW: Contact Galenia Hospital**
   - Discuss partnership/pre-admission agreement
   - Understand their capacity for emergency transfers
   - Contact: [Galenia Hospital](https://hospitalgalenia.com/en/)

### If Medical Investment Is Approved

6. **Schedule Site Visit: Hotel Alea Tulum**
   - Physical inspection of property
   - Assess ICU/helipad build-out locations
   - Meet with current ownership
   - Test actual drive times to Costamed Tulum

7. **Initiate Due Diligence**
   - Title search (10+ years)
   - Zoning confirmation for medical facility
   - Environmental assessment
   - Financial review (current operations)

### Alternative Track

8. **Explore Puerto Morelos / Playa del Carmen North**
   - These locations are 30-45 min from Cancún hospitals
   - May meet G1/G2 gates without additional medical investment
   - Trade-off: Less "healing atmosphere" than Tulum

## Key Insight: The Tulum Trade-Off

All evaluated properties reveal a fundamental trade-off in Quintana Roo:

| Location | Medical Access | Brand Alignment | Resolution |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Cancún** | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Poor | Urban environment unsuitable for healing brand |
| **Tulum** | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent | Must solve hospital gap through helicopter + on-site capability |
| **Puerto Morelos/Playa** | ⚠️ Good | ⚠️ Moderate | Best compromise - may sacrifice some natural beauty |

**The framework correctly identified this:** Tulum is potentially the BEST location IF medical infrastructure can be verified/established.

**Research Conclusion:** Hospital Joya Tulum does not exist yet, and there is no local helicopter ambulance service. However, the gap CAN be mitigated through:
- Enhanced on-site ICU capability
- Pre-arranged helicopter evacuation (35-50 min to Cancún)
- Partnership with Galenia Hospital

**Updated Recommendation:**
- If additional $700K-1.5M capital + $400K/year operations cost is acceptable → **Proceed with Hotel Alea Tulum**
- If not → **Pivot to Puerto Morelos/Playa del Carmen North** properties that meet hospital gates without mitigation
