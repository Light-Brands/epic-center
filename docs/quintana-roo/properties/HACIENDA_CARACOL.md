## Key Strengths

1. **Exceptional setting** - Beachfront hacienda on Soliman Bay, stunning natural beauty
2. **Premium privacy** - Private estate with controlled access, secluded location
3. **Luxury infrastructure** - High-end finishes, chef's kitchen, pool, staff quarters
4. **Beach helicopter access** - Beachfront allows potential helicopter landing
5. **Established operations** - Currently operating successfully as $2,425/night rental
6. **Staff in place** - Chef, concierge, housekeeping, grounds staff already operating

## Key Concerns

1. **CRITICAL: Medical infrastructure gap** - Same as all Tulum properties - 70+ min to JCI hospital
2. **Capacity limitation** - 10 rooms is Tier 2 level, below Tier 1 flagship (20 rooms)
3. **Cost per room** - $1.449M/room significantly exceeds $1M target
4. **Zoning uncertainty** - Vacation rental → commercial medical hospitality may face resistance
5. **Federal beach zone** - Beachfront development restrictions apply
6. **Natural disaster exposure** - Direct beachfront increases hurricane/storm surge risk

## Questions to Resolve

1. Is property owner willing to sell (currently operating as rental)?
2. What are federal beach zone restrictions for medical facility use?
3. Is expansion possible to increase room count toward 15-20?
4. Can beach be formally permitted as emergency helicopter landing zone?
5. What is the current rental income (for comparative ROI analysis)?
6. What is the property's hurricane history and insurance status?

## Recommendation

☐ **SHORTLIST** - Proceed to site visit and due diligence
✅ **HOLD** - Monitor, needs more information
☐ **PASS** - Does not meet requirements

**Rationale:**

Hacienda Caracol scores 76/100 (Very Good) and shares the same exceptional qualities as Hotel Alea Tulum:
- Perfect natural environment (6/6)
- Maximum privacy (12/12)
- Strong brand alignment (2/2)

**However, compared to Hotel Alea, Hacienda Caracol has additional challenges:**

| Factor | Hotel Alea | Hacienda Caracol | Advantage |
|--------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| Room Count | 21 rooms | 10 rooms | Hotel Alea |
| Cost/Room | $928K | $1.449M | Hotel Alea |
| Total Investment | $19.5M | $14.5M | Hacienda Caracol |
| Current Status | Operating hotel | Vacation rental | Hotel Alea |
| Zoning | Commercial | Residential/rental | Hotel Alea |
| Beach Access | Club beach | Private beach | Hacienda Caracol |

**Recommendation:** Place on **HOLD** pending:
1. Resolution of Tulum hospital access question (affects all Tulum properties)
2. Comparison outcome with Hotel Alea (which offers more capacity at lower cost/room)
3. Confirmation that property is actually available for sale

**If Hotel Alea is unavailable or price negotiations fail, Hacienda Caracol becomes a strong secondary option for a Tier 2 facility** rather than Tier 1 flagship.

**Best use case:** If a smaller, more exclusive "ultra-private" tier is added to the facility strategy, Hacienda Caracol would be an excellent fit for 8-10 premium guests at a time.
