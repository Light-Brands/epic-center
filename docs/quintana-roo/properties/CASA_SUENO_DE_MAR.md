## Pass/Fail Gate Assessment

| Gate | Requirement | Result | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| G1 | JCI hospital ≤30 min | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Hospital Playa del Carmen ~30-35 min. Cancún JCI hospitals ~55-65 min |
| G2 | Cardiac cath lab available | ⚠️ CRITICAL | Hospital Playa del Carmen capabilities unclear. Cancún 55-65 min |
| G3 | ≥5 bedrooms or expansion space | ✅ PASS | 7 bedrooms - meets minimum, but below Tier 1/2 targets |
| G4 | Zoning permits use | ❌ LIKELY FAIL | Residential gated community - commercial medical use highly unlikely |
| G5 | Safe security zone | ✅ PASS | Gated community within Bahía Príncipe - very secure |
| G6 | Clear title | ⚠️ VERIFY | Requires title search |
| G7 | Utilities available | ✅ PASS | Master-planned community - full utilities |
| G8 | Ambulance road access | ✅ PASS | Paved roads, gated community access protocols |
| G9 | Structurally sound | ✅ LIKELY | New/recent construction in planned development |

**GATE RESULT:** ❌ LIKELY FAIL - G4 (Zoning) is a fundamental blocker. Residential gated community with HOA/CCRs will almost certainly prohibit commercial medical hospitality operations.

## Key Strengths

1. **Excellent infrastructure** - Master-planned community with reliable utilities
2. **Good security** - Gated community with controlled access
3. **Low natural disaster risk** - Inland location with proper drainage
4. **Quality construction** - High-end residential in established development
5. **Central location** - Between Tulum and Playa del Carmen
6. **Community amenities** - Golf, beach club, sports complex available

## Key Concerns

1. **DISQUALIFYING: Zoning** - Residential gated community will not permit commercial medical operations
2. **DISQUALIFYING: HOA/CCRs** - Community covenants will prohibit hospitality/medical use
3. **Insufficient capacity** - 7 rooms below Tier 2 minimum (10 rooms)
4. **Poor brand fit** - Golf/residential community does not convey healing retreat
5. **Neighbor conflicts** - Medical facility operations incompatible with residential neighbors
6. **High cost/room** - $1.7M per room significantly exceeds targets
7. **No expansion possible** - Cannot add rooms in gated community lot

## Questions to Resolve

1. ~~Is commercial medical use permitted?~~ **Almost certainly NO - residential HOA**
2. ~~Can the property be expanded?~~ **Almost certainly NO - defined lot in master plan**
3. What is the specific developer meeting about? (Potentially different project?)

## Recommendation

☐ **SHORTLIST** - Proceed to site visit and due diligence
☐ **HOLD** - Monitor, needs more information
✅ **PASS** - Does not meet requirements

**Rationale:**

Casa Sueño de Mar **FAILS** the verification process on multiple fundamental criteria:

### Disqualifying Factors:

1. **Gate G4 FAILURE (Zoning)**
   - Residential gated community
   - HOA/CCRs will prohibit commercial operations
   - Medical facility incompatible with residential neighbors
   - Cannot obtain permits for intended use

2. **Insufficient Capacity**
   - 7 rooms below Tier 2 minimum (10) and Tier 1 target (20)
   - No expansion possibility within gated community lot

3. **Brand Misalignment**
   - Golf/residential community atmosphere
   - Neighbors, families, recreational golfers
   - Does not convey healing sanctuary environment

4. **Economics**
   - $1.7M per room - highest cost/room of all evaluated properties
   - Investment cannot be justified for 7-room capacity

### Developer Meeting Note:

The mention of "Meeting Developer Tulum Country Club" suggests this may be about a **different opportunity** - perhaps land within the development for new construction, or a commercial parcel.

**If the developer is offering:**
- A commercial-zoned parcel
- Land for new-build facility
- A different property type

...that would be a **separate evaluation** and could be worth exploring.

**For the specific Casa Sueño de Mar residential property: PASS - Not suitable.**
