## Key Strengths

1. **Perfect brand alignment** - Eco-boutique property matches healing/wellness positioning exactly
2. **Exceptional natural setting** - Jungle, mangrove, private beach, bay views
3. **Maximum privacy** - Secluded location with natural barriers and controlled access
4. **Operating hotel** - Established infrastructure, permits, trained staff potentially available
5. **Tulum Airport operational** - TQO dramatically improves guest accessibility
6. **Adequate capacity** - 21 rooms meets Tier 1 flagship requirements

## Key Concerns

1. **CRITICAL: Medical infrastructure gap** - JCI hospital 70+ min away, NO cardiac cath within 30 min
2. **Premium pricing** - $305K/room acquisition vs $55K for Cancún property
3. **Hurricane/flood exposure** - Coastal mangrove location increases natural risks
4. **Environmental restrictions** - Mangrove proximity may limit expansion/modification
5. **Helicopter requirement** - Must establish evacuation capability for cardiac emergencies

## Questions to Resolve

1. **URGENT: What is the current status of Hospital Joya Tulum?** Does it have cardiac cath capability?
2. Can a helipad be permitted on or near the property?
3. What is the actual helicopter flight time to Galenia Hospital Cancún?
4. What are the environmental restrictions on the property?
5. What is the current operating revenue and occupancy?
6. Are existing staff interested in continuing employment?

## Recommendation

✅ **SHORTLIST** - Proceed to site visit and due diligence
☐ **HOLD** - Monitor, needs more information
☐ **PASS** - Does not meet requirements

**Rationale:**

Hotel Alea Tulum represents the **ideal brand positioning** for the wellness retreat concept:
- Perfect natural environment (6/6)
- Maximum privacy (12/12)
- Full strategic alignment (2/2)

**HOWEVER**, the property has a **CRITICAL CONTINGENCY** on the medical infrastructure gate (G1/G2):

**The property should be shortlisted with the following conditions:**

1. **MUST VERIFY before proceeding:**
   - Hospital Joya Tulum cardiac capability status
   - Helicopter evacuation protocol feasibility (target: <20 min to Cancún JCI hospital)
   - On-site ICU build-out scope and cost

2. **MUST SOLVE before acquisition:**
   - Helicopter landing zone (property or nearby)
   - Air ambulance service agreement
   - On-site cardiac monitoring and stabilization capability

**If the hospital access gap can be resolved through helicopter evacuation + enhanced on-site capability, this becomes a TOP CANDIDATE.**

The property exemplifies the Tulum opportunity documented in the framework: perfect brand fit, but requiring infrastructure solutions for the medical access gap.

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Verify Hospital Joya Tulum status (URGENT)
2. Contact air ambulance services for Tulum coverage
3. Schedule site visit if medical contingency appears solvable
