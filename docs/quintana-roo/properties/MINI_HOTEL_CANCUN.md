## Key Strengths

1. **Exceptional medical access** - Best hospital infrastructure in Quintana Roo (3 JCI hospitals within 20 min)
2. **Outstanding value** - $55K per room acquisition cost, total project ~$543K/room vs $1M target
3. **Established operations** - Operating hotel reduces permitting/conversion risk
4. **Full infrastructure** - Urban utilities, road access, airport proximity all excellent

## Key Concerns

1. **CRITICAL: Brand misalignment** - Urban hotel environment does not support healing/wellness retreat positioning
2. **Limited privacy** - Urban setting compromises guest discretion and healing atmosphere
3. **No natural features** - Lacks cenotes, jungle, beach, or scenic elements expected by clientele
4. **Competitive differentiation** - How does urban location differentiate from competitors?

## Questions to Resolve

1. What is the specific neighborhood character and surrounding land uses?
2. Is there any outdoor/garden space that could be developed for treatments?
3. Could this serve as a Cancún "check-in" location or administrative hub rather than primary treatment facility?
4. Are there expansion possibilities to add natural features?

## Recommendation

☐ **SHORTLIST** - Proceed to site visit and due diligence
☐ **HOLD** - Monitor, needs more information
✅ **PASS** - Does not meet requirements

**Rationale:**

While this property scores 79/100 (Very Good) based on the quantitative framework, the qualitative assessment reveals a **fundamental brand misalignment**. The property excels in medical infrastructure (19/20) and financial value ($543K/room), but scores poorly in the categories most important for guest experience and brand positioning:

- Natural Environment: 2/6
- Privacy & Security: 7/12
- Strategic Fit: 0/2

**The urban Cancún location is incompatible with a premium healing/wellness retreat brand.** Guests paying $50-60K for transformative health experiences expect:
- Serene natural settings
- Visual and acoustic privacy
- Connection to nature (cenotes, jungle, beach)
- Healing atmosphere

This property could potentially serve as:
- Administrative/back-office hub
- Guest check-in/transfer point
- Staff training facility

**Not recommended as primary treatment facility despite strong score.**
