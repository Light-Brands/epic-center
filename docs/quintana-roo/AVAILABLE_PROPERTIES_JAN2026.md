## Tier 1 - Strong Candidates (Best Brand & Criteria Fit)

### 1. Tankah Bay 21-Room Beachfront Hotel

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Price** | $8,500,000 USD |

| **Size** | 21,743 sq ft on 2,020 m² |
| **Beachfront** | 50 linear meters (164 ft) direct ocean frontage |
| **Current Use** | Operational boutique hotel + private residence |

**Description:** Dual-parcel beachfront estate combining a fully operational 21-room boutique hotel and a luxury 6-bedroom villa. Penthouse suites with private plunge pools, swim-up suites with water access. Serene Tankah Bay location away from busy Tulum beach strip.

- 21 rooms matches Hotel Alea Tier 1 capacity
- Beachfront natural setting with privacy
- Already operational with staff/systems in place
- Second parcel allows expansion to 42+ rooms
- Secluded bay location ideal for healing retreat

**Considerations:**
- Higher acquisition price ($8.5M vs $6.4M Hotel Alea)
- Same medical infrastructure gap as other Tulum properties (~70 min to JCI hospital)
- Pricing based on land + construction value, not hotel operations
- Villa parcel qualifies as undeveloped land for future expansion

### 2. Cenote Ka'ax Jungle Retreat & Hotel

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Price** | $4,000,000 USD |
| **Location** | Rancho San Martin, Akumal (between Playa del Carmen & Tulum) |
| **Rooms** | 7 private jungle cabins |
| **Size** | 15,069 sq ft buildings on 8 hectares (~20 acres) of jungle |
| **Current Use** | Operating eco-retreat (Ka'ax Cenote Resort) |

**Description:** Extraordinary 8-hectare Mayan jungle estate centered around a pristine freshwater cenote with crystalline turquoise waters (24–26°C year-round). Three handcrafted wooden cenote decks, 7 private jungle cabins, restaurant/bar with professional kitchen, swimming pool, consecrated jungle chapel, spa, temazcal, indoor/outdoor gym, walking trails, and caretaker's home.

**Why it fits:**
- Exceptional natural healing environment (cenote, jungle, trails)
- Spiritual/ceremonial infrastructure already built (chapel, temazcal)
- Wellness infrastructure in place (spa, gym, yoga spaces)
- 8 hectares provides massive expansion potential
- Titled estate with operational amenities
- Sustainable/eco design aligns with brand philosophy
- Location between PDC and Tulum, potentially better medical access than deep Tulum
- Strong brand story (cenote as centerpiece of healing experience)

**Considerations:**
- Only 7 cabins currently, needs expansion to reach Tier 1/2 capacity
- 8 hectares of jungle = more complex maintenance
- Verify zoning permits for medical/hospitality use
- Distance to nearest JCI hospital needs verification (likely 40–50 min to Playa hospitals)
- Akumal location may be less recognizable to international clients than "Tulum"

Situated in a 50+ year old coconut grove of 100+ trees, adjacent to UNESCO World Heritage Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (1.3 million acres).

**Why it fits:**
- Unmatched natural setting (Sian Ka'an adjacency, coconut grove, pristine beach)
- Maximum privacy and seclusion (southern beach, residential area to north)
- Eco/sustainability credentials (LEED Platinum, 100% solar) align with brand
- Yoga studio already built
- Architectural distinction (Austrian naturalist design)
- UNESCO proximity adds prestige

**Considerations:**
- Only 9 suites, below Tier 2 minimum of 10 (needs expansion)
- $6.7M for 9 rooms = $744K/room (premium per-room cost)
- 0.70 acres limits expansion potential
- Furthest from medical infrastructure (south of Tulum = 80+ min to JCI)
- Sian Ka'an proximity may restrict construction/expansion

### 10. Lagoonfront Wellness Retreat - Lake Bacalar

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Price** | Starting at $2,000,000 USD |
| **Location** | Lake Bacalar, Q.R. (Lagoon of Seven Colors) |

- Attractive price point
- Growing destination with less competition than Tulum
- Unique water-based healing environment

**Considerations:**
- Bacalar is ~3 hours south of Cancún, significantly further from medical infrastructure

- Room count and specific details need inquiry

## Tier 3 - Playa del Carmen Properties (Better Medical Access, Urban Trade-off)

These Playa del Carmen properties are worth noting because PDC has **significantly better hospital access** than Tulum (Hospiten, Hospital Amerimed, and others within city limits). However, they are more urban, which may conflict with the natural healing environment brand positioning.

**Strategic note:** A Playa del Carmen property could serve as a **medical hub / intake facility** paired with a Tulum/jungle flagship, solving the medical infrastructure gap.

### 11. Hotel Kinbe - 30 Rooms, Playa del Carmen

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Price** | $3,500,000 USD |
| **Location** | Near 5th Avenue, Centro, Playa del Carmen |
| **Rooms** | 30 rooms |
| **Size** | 11,678 sq ft, 4 levels |
| **Current Use** | Operating boutique hotel |

**Description:** Four-level boutique hotel with 30 Caribbean-styled rooms near 5th Avenue. Pool with cascading waterfall, rooftop solarium, personalized concierge services, exclusive ZENZI Beach Club access.

- Established hotel with operations
- Near hospitals (Hospiten PDC ~10 min, Amerimed ~15 min)
- Attractive price per room (~$117K/room)

**Considerations:**
- Urban 5th Avenue location, not suitable as primary healing retreat
- Better positioned as medical intake / processing center
- Brand misalignment for primary facility (similar to Mini Hotel Cancún rejection)

- Near PDC hospitals for medical access
- Proven revenue generator

**Considerations:**

- Same brand positioning concern as other PDC properties
- 354 m² lot is compact

## Tier 4 - Scale Plays (Too Large or Out of Budget, but Notable)

### 16. 95-Key Hotel - Central Tulum

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Price** | $16,500,000 USD |
| **Location** | Central Tulum, Q.R. |
| **Rooms** | 95 keys (87 guest rooms + 8 two-bedroom condos) |

**Description:** Large income-producing hotel with rooftop infinity-edge pool, jacuzzi, full-service restaurant/bar with panoramic jungle views. Near both Tulum International Airport (TQO) and Cancún International Airport (CUN).

### 17. 10-Unit Boutique Hotel - La Veleta, Tulum

| **Rooms** | 10 units (9 one-bedroom condos + 2-bedroom penthouse) |
| **Size** | 450 m² lot, 600 m² construction, 3 stories |
| **Current Use** | Vacation rental investment |

**Description:** Budget-friendly 10-unit property with rooftop pool, terrace, garden, lobby, and storage.

## Top Recommendations

### Best Overall Candidates (in priority order)

1. **Cenote Ka'ax ($4.0M)** - The cenote + jungle + 8 hectares combination is exceptional for a healing retreat brand. Existing ceremony/wellness infrastructure (temazcal, chapel, spa) is unique. Mid-corridor location may improve medical access. Expansion potential is massive. Needs room count buildout.

2. **Tankah Bay 21-Room ($8.5M)** - Closest analog to Hotel Alea with 21 rooms, beachfront, and operational status. Dual-parcel expansion to 42+ rooms is compelling. Premium price but includes villa asset. Secluded bay setting.

3. **Jungle Keva ($1.4M)** - Best value acquisition with award-winning design DNA. Too small alone but could anchor a multi-property strategy or serve as the design/brand template for a larger adjacent build.

### Dual-Property Strategy Option

Pair a **nature-based flagship** (Cenote Ka'ax or Tankah Bay) with a **Playa del Carmen medical hub** (Hotel Kinbe at $3.5M or Hotel #4 at $2.0M) to solve the medical infrastructure gap:

- **Cenote Ka'ax + Hotel #4 PDC** = $6.0M combined (wellness flagship + medical intake)
- **Tankah Bay + Hotel Kinbe PDC** = $12.0M combined (beachfront flagship + 30-room medical center)
