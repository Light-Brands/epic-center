# Master Structure: The Complete TE + Light Brands Global Architecture

> **Status:** Definitive structure — requires counsel validation before implementation
> **Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## 1. Summary

Transformational Epicenter operates through six entities across five jurisdictions, owned by a single Panama Private Interest Foundation (with one entity accepting outside investment). **TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman) is the investable vehicle — it owns all TE IP, collects all TE revenue at 0% corporate tax, controls the Mexico OpCo, and licenses content to the Church. **Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC** (Dubai) is the shared service center — it builds for both TE Holdings and Light Brands under cost-plus contracts at 0% (QFZP). **Light Brands Consulting Ltd** (Cook Islands IBC) faces external consulting and SaaS clients, collects Light Brands revenue at 0%, and subcontracts all development to Studio. A US church distributes the spiritual mission at 0% federal tax and receives dual royalty streams from both TE Holdings and CI IBC. A Mexican operating company delivers the guest experience at 30% on margin only. The US founder has no ownership stake in any foreign entity, eliminating all CFC/GILTI exposure. The Canadian founder departs Canada before the seed round and pays 0% personal tax. The entity-level effective tax rate is ~1.2%.

## 2. The Six Entities

Six entities. Five jurisdictions. One architecture. Meet them one at a time.

### THE PRODUCT — TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman)

```mermaid

    PRODUCT["🏛 THE PRODUCT<br/>TE Wellness Holdings<br/>(Cayman Exempted Co.)<br/>0% tax — unconditional"]

    PRODUCT --- owns["Owns all TE IP"]
    PRODUCT --- collects["Collects $10.7M → $35.5M revenue"]
    PRODUCT --- controls["Controls Mexico OpCo (100%)"]
    PRODUCT --- licenses["Licenses content to Church"]
    PRODUCT --- contracts["Contracts dev to Studio"]
    PRODUCT --- investable["~30% investor equity"]

    style PRODUCT fill:#8b5e3c,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
```

The investable vehicle. Every dollar of TE healing center revenue flows here first. It owns the IP, holds the Stripe merchant account, controls the Mexican operations, and licenses spiritual content to the Church. Cayman Exempted Company with 20-year tax undertaking — 0% is unconditional, no substance requirements. This is where the investor buys ~30% equity using VC-standard mechanics (SHA, liquidation preference, board seat).

### THE BUILDER — Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC (Dubai)

```mermaid
graph TB
    BUILDER["🔨 THE BUILDER<br/>Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC<br/>(Dubai Internet City)<br/>0% tax — QFZP"]

    BUILDER --- builds_te["Builds TE platform for Holdings"]
    BUILDER --- builds_lb["Builds LB products for CI IBC"]
    BUILDER --- employs["Employs 5-6 Dubai team"]
    BUILDER --- salary["Pays founder salaries"]
    BUILDER --- creates["Creates all IP (owns none)"]

    style BUILDER fill:#0f3460,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
```

The shared service center. Every line of code, every AI model, every design is built here. Studio employs the Dubai tech team (CTO, engineers, AI/ML, PM, finance) and both founders. It creates IP under work-for-hire contracts but owns none of the product-specific IP — TE IP goes to Holdings, LB IP goes to CI IBC. Pure B2B service company earning cost-plus margins at 0% under QFZP.

### THE VOICE — Light Brands Consulting Ltd (Cook Islands IBC)

```mermaid
graph TB
    VOICE["📣 THE VOICE<br/>Light Brands Consulting Ltd<br/>(Cook Islands IBC)<br/>0% tax — international income"]

    VOICE --- signs["Signs external client contracts"]
    VOICE --- collects_lb["Collects all LB revenue"]
    VOICE --- owns_lb["Owns LB-specific IP"]
    VOICE --- subs["Subcontracts ALL dev to Studio"]
    VOICE --- licenses_st["Licenses spiritual tech to Church"]

    style VOICE fill:#0d7377,stroke:#14ffec,color:#fff
```

The client-facing consulting and SaaS entity. CI IBC signs the contracts, collects the revenue, owns LB-specific IP, and licenses spiritual technology to the Church. It has **zero employees** — intentionally thin to avoid creating permanent establishment anywhere. All development is subcontracted to Studio at arm's length. 0% on international income with asset protection under Cook Islands law.

### THE SHIELD — Panama PIF

```mermaid
graph TB
    SHIELD["🛡 THE SHIELD<br/>Panama Private Interest Foundation<br/>(Law 25/1995)<br/>0% tax — foreign income"]

    SHIELD --- holds_te["Owns ~70% of Holdings"]
    SHIELD --- holds_studio["Owns 100% of Studio"]
    SHIELD --- holds_ci["Owns 100% of CI IBC"]
    SHIELD --- privacy["Beneficiary identities private"]
    SHIELD --- protection["Asset protection"]

    style SHIELD fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
```

The ownership layer. The PIF is an independent legal person — it has no "owner." It holds ~70% of Holdings, 100% of Studio, and 100% of CI IBC, keeping beneficiary identities private. The Canadian founder serves as Protector. The US founder is **not** a beneficiary (eliminating CFC/GILTI). A Foundation Council of 3+ members (at least 1 independent) governs. Private regulations name beneficiaries. 0% on foreign-source income.

### THE HEART — Church of the Living Light

```mermaid
graph TB
    HEART["💜 THE HEART<br/>Church of the Living Light<br/>508(c)(1)(A) Nonprofit<br/>0% tax — exempt"]

    HEART --- receives_content["Receives content license from Holdings"]
    HEART --- receives_tech["Receives spiritual tech license from CI IBC"]
    HEART --- distributes["Distributes teachings to public"]
    HEART --- employs_ministers["Employs founders as ministers"]
    HEART --- housing["Provides tax-free housing (IRC 107)"]
    HEART --- retirement["Offers tax-deferred retirement"]

    style HEART fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
```

The spiritual mission. The Church receives dual royalty streams — content from Holdings and spiritual tech from CI IBC — both UBIT-exempt under IRC 512(b)(2). It distributes teachings, runs worship services (weekly online, monthly in-person), and employs both founders as ordained ministers. Compensation channels include salary, tax-free housing allowance (IRC 107), and tax-deferred retirement (403(b)(9), 457(b), 457(f)). Governed by an independent Spiritual Council (3-5 members, 1+ unrelated to founders).

### THE HANDS — TE Ops Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.

```mermaid
graph TB
    HANDS["🤲 THE HANDS<br/>TE Ops Mexico<br/>S. de R.L. de C.V.<br/>30% tax — on margin only"]

    HANDS --- operates["Operates healing facility in Tulum"]
    HANDS --- employs_local["Employs local staff"]
    HANDS --- delivers["Delivers guest experience"]
    HANDS --- receives_fee["Receives cost + 8-12% from Holdings"]

    style HANDS fill:#16213e,stroke:#0f3460,color:#fff
```

The boots on the ground. Mexico OpCo operates the physical facility, employs local staff (facilitators, kitchen, medical, maintenance), and delivers the guest experience. Owned 100% by TE Holdings. It receives only a cost-plus service fee — the vast majority of profit stays in Holdings at 0%. Mexico's 30% corporate tax applies only to the 8-12% margin, keeping total Mexico tax to ~$126K (Y1) → ~$420K (Y5).

## 3. Who Owns What

Ownership only — no money flows, no services. Just the lines of control.

    style MEXICO fill:#16213e,stroke:#0f3460,color:#fff
    style CHURCH fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
```

Key points:
- **One PIF owns everything** (except investor's share and the Church)
- **Investor equity isolated** to TE Holdings only — no exposure to Studio, LB, or Church
- **Church has no owner** — nonprofit governed by independent Spiritual Council
- **Mexico OpCo owned by Holdings** (not by Studio) — Holdings controls all TE operations

## 4. Entity Table

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Legal Form | Role | Tax Rate | Ownership | Setup Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TE Wellness Holdings** | Cayman Islands | Exempted Company | Owns all TE IP, collects all TE revenue ($10.7M→$35.5M), controls Mexico OpCo, licenses content to Church. Investable vehicle. | 0% (unconditional, 20-year exemption) | ~70% Panama PIF + ~30% investor | ~$8-14K |

    style F fill:#0a8754,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
```

**Revenue path:** Guest pays via TE app (Stripe) → TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) → retains ~43% EBITDA at 0% tax + pays dev services fee to Studio (cost + 8-12% margin, 0% QFZP) + pays service fee to Mexico OpCo (cost + 8-12% margin, taxed at 30% on the margin) + pays content license fee to Church (arm's length, 0% on both sides).

## 6. How Money Flows — Light Brands Revenue

```mermaid

    subgraph "Sales — 0%"

    subgraph "Holding — 0%"

    end

    CLIENT -->|"Consulting fee /<br/>SaaS subscription"| CI
    CI -->|"Subcontracts dev<br/>(arm's length fee)"| UAE2
    CI -->|"Spiritual tech<br/>license (royalty)"| CHURCH2
    CI -->|"Distributes<br/>profits"| PIF

    style CLIENT fill:#2d4059,stroke:#ea5455,color:#fff
    style CI fill:#0d7377,stroke:#14ffec,color:#fff

    style CHURCH2 fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style PIF fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
```

**Revenue path:** External client pays CI IBC (0%) → CI IBC subcontracts dev to Studio (0%) → CI IBC licenses spiritual tech to Church (0% UBIT-exempt royalty) → CI IBC distributes profits to PIF (0% WHT) → PIF to beneficiaries at personal rates.

## 7. How Money Flows — REFIPRE Safe Route

Mexico's REFIPRE rules impose **40% WHT** on payments to preferential tax regimes (<22.5% effective). The Cook Islands qualifies. This diagram shows the safe routing path — and the forbidden shortcut.

```mermaid
graph LR
    MEX["TE Ops Mexico<br/>(30% on margin)"]
    HOLDINGS["TE Holdings<br/>(Cayman — 0%)"]
    STUDIO["Studio<br/>(Dubai — 0%)"]
    CI["CI IBC<br/>(Cook Islands — 0%)"]

    MEX -->|"Service fee<br/>(parent-subsidiary)"| HOLDINGS
    HOLDINGS -->|"Dev services<br/>(existing contract)"| STUDIO
    STUDIO -->|"Subcontract<br/>(arm's length)"| CI

    MEX -.-x|"FORBIDDEN<br/>40% WHT + non-deductible"| CI

    style MEX fill:#16213e,stroke:#0f3460,color:#fff
    style HOLDINGS fill:#8b5e3c,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style STUDIO fill:#0f3460,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
    style CI fill:#0d7377,stroke:#14ffec,color:#fff

    linkStyle 3 stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:3px
```

**Why this works:** Mexico → Holdings is a standard parent-subsidiary payment (not REFIPRE-triggering). Holdings → Studio is the existing dev services contract. Studio → CI IBC is the existing development subcontract. All three intermediate entities are at 0%, so the routing costs **$0 in additional tax**. The only thing that matters is Mexico never pays CI IBC directly.

## 8. How IP Is Created and Owned

    TE_IP -->|"Content license<br/>(arm's length royalty)"| CHURCH_IP

    style CHURCH_IP fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style PUBLIC fill:#2d4059,stroke:#ea5455,color:#fff
```

**Key rules:**
- **Studio creates everything, owns nothing** (product-specific). It retains only internal dev methodologies and tools.
- **TE IP** (platform, AI agents, courses, brand) → assigned to Holdings under the Dev Services Agreement
- **LB IP** (consulting frameworks, SaaS, spiritual tech) → assigned to CI IBC under the Dev Subcontract
- **Church licenses and distributes** — it never creates or owns IP
- All licenses priced at arm's length with transfer pricing documentation

**Three pay channels, three founders:**

| Channel | US Founder | Canadian Founder | Cyprus Founder |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Studio salary** | FEIE shelters first $130K | 0% (Dubai resident, no Canadian tax post-departure) | 0% (90-day overseas employment exemption) |
| **Church minister salary** | Taxable (SE opt-out available) | Taxable at personal rate | Taxable at personal rate |
| **Church housing allowance** | Tax-free under IRC 107 | N/A | N/A |
| **Church retirement** | Tax-deferred (403b/457b/457f) | N/A | N/A |
| **Church-owned assets** | Ministry use (documented) | N/A | N/A |
| **PIF distributions** | NOT a beneficiary (no CFC/GILTI) | 0% | ~7.65% (5% SDC + GHS) |

**Critical:** The US founder is **not** a PIF beneficiary or owner. This eliminates CFC, GILTI, Subpart F, and Form 5471 entirely.

*Light Brands revenue is additive. All LB income flows through 0% entities (CI IBC + Studio), so LB revenue does not increase the entity-level tax.*

## 13. Substance Requirements

Each entity must be genuinely operational. A shell entity will not survive scrutiny.

| Entity | What Makes It Real | Minimum Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **TE Holdings (Cayman)** | Owns TE IP, collects $10-35M revenue, controls Mexico OpCo, has investor shareholders and independent board | Board meetings, annual audit (investor requirement), Stripe payment processing, intercompany agreements, Economic Substance Notification filing. **Zero local substance required** — Exempted Companies exempt from ESA for IP/revenue holding. |
| **Studio FZ-LLC (Dubai)** | Shared service center — employs the team that builds for TE Holdings and LB | Office in DIC, 5-6 employees (CTO, engineers, AI/ML, PM, finance), all development performed here, annual audit, QFZP filing, DEMPE documentation |
| **CI IBC (Light Brands)** | Client-facing entity that signs contracts, collects LB revenue, owns LB-specific IP | Registered agent in Cook Islands, nominee director, Singapore bank account, intercompany subcontract with Studio, TP documentation. **Intentionally thin — zero employees, zero office.** |
| **Panama PIF** | Holds ownership of Holdings (~70%), Studio (100%), and CI IBC (100%); independent governance | Foundation Council of 3 members (at least 1 independent), separate bank account, private regulations naming beneficiaries, Protector appointed |
| **Church** | Genuine religious organization with regular congregation | Independent Spiritual Council (3-5 members, 1+ unrelated to founders), weekly worship services, ordained ministers, doctrinal framework, charitable programs, separate bank account and EIN |
| **Mexico OpCo** | Operates the physical facility; employs local staff | Local employees (facilitators, kitchen, medical, maintenance), own RFC/tax ID, own bank account, service delivery agreement with TE Holdings, transfer pricing study |

## 14. Year 1-5 Projections

### TE Healing Center (from data.ts)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **HC Revenue** | $10,748,000 | $18,152,000 | $25,904,000 | $31,715,000 | $35,461,000 |
| **EBITDA Margin** | 43% | 57% | 60% | 60% | 61% |
| **EBITDA** | $4,672,000 | $10,347,000 | $15,542,000 | $19,029,000 | $21,512,217 |
| **Mexico OpCo Tax (~30% on margin)** | ~$126K | ~$200K | ~$300K | ~$360K | ~$420K |
| **TE Holdings Tax** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Studio Tax** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Church Tax** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Entity Effective Rate** | ~1.2% | ~1.1% | ~1.2% | ~1.1% | ~1.2% |
| **5-Year Cumulative Revenue** | | | | | **$125,880,000** |
| **Y5 Enterprise Value (SOTP)** | | | | | **~$147,000,000** |

### Light Brands (estimates — pre-revenue, scale TBD)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LB Revenue (CI IBC)** | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **CI IBC Tax** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Tax on LB Revenue** | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

*Light Brands revenue projections will be added when the product roadmap is finalized. Regardless of revenue scale, LB revenue flows through 0% entities (CI IBC + Studio) and does not increase the entity-level tax burden. All TE HC revenue figures from data.ts. Mexico OpCo tax estimated at 30% on an 8-12% service margin.*

## 15. Key Constraints

These are the walls that cannot be moved. The structure is designed around them.

| Constraint | Impact | How the Structure Handles It |
|---|---|---|
| **Mexico 30% corporate tax** | Every peso of Mexican-source profit is taxed at 30% | OpCo receives only cost + 8-12% margin; the vast majority of profit stays in TE Holdings at 0% |
| **REFIPRE (Mexico anti-avoidance)** | Payments from Mexico to preferential tax regimes (<22.5% effective) trigger 40% WHT + non-deductibility | Revenue flows INTO TE Holdings from guests (Platform-as-Principal model). Mexico OpCo is a subsidiary of Holdings — standard parent-subsidiary arrangements. Mexico OpCo NEVER pays CI IBC directly — all intercompany services route through Holdings and Studio. |
| **US worldwide taxation** | US citizens owe tax on worldwide income regardless of residence | US founder structured as employee (not owner) → no CFC/GILTI. FEIE shelters $130K salary. Church channels convert taxable salary into tax-free housing and tax-deferred retirement. |
| **Canadian departure tax** | CRA deems all assets disposed at FMV on departure date | Depart BEFORE the seed round closes (pre-revenue = minimal FMV = minimal tax). This is time-sensitive. |
| **Cyprus deemed domicile** | 25+ year resident pays 5% SDC on dividends (was 17%) | Use salary (0% via 90-day overseas employment exemption) as primary channel. Dividends as affordable secondary channel (~7.65%). |
| **QFZP natural persons exclusion** | UAE QFZP rules exclude "transactions with natural persons" from qualifying income | **Eliminated as concern for TE revenue.** Studio earns B2B service fees from Holdings (a company), not from individual guests. QFZP risk isolated to Studio's service fees only. |
| **Investor wants TE equity only** | Investor requires standard VC mechanics (SHA, liquidation pref, board seat) in a clean TE vehicle | TE Holdings (Cayman Exempted Company) is the VC-standard investable vehicle. Investor buys ~30% of Holdings. No exposure to Studio, LB, or Church. |
| **CI IBC zero-employee requirement** | Employees in any country create permanent establishment, potentially subjecting the CI IBC to that country's tax | CI IBC has ZERO employees. All development is subcontracted to Studio under arm's length arrangements. The CI IBC is intentionally "thin." |

---

## 16. Rules That Cannot Be Broken

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| **The church does not collect program fees** | Program revenue goes to TE Holdings. The church is a spiritual mission, not a commercial platform. |
| **The UAE entity does not control the church** | The church has its own independent Spiritual Council. No entity governance overlap. |
| **The PIF does not own the church** | Nonprofits have no owners. The PIF can donate but has zero governance authority. |
| **All founder compensation is board-approved** | Every dollar paid to founders is approved by disinterested Spiritual Council members using comparable data. |
| **TE IP belongs to TE Holdings; LB IP belongs to CI IBC** | The church licenses — it never creates or owns IP. Studio creates IP under contract but owns none of the product-specific IP. |
| **No circular flows** | No entity donates to the church so the church can pay the founders. Donations must fund the mission. |
| **No commingling** | Every entity has its own bank account. No shared accounts, no cross-entity spending. |
| **Ministry use of assets is documented** | Church-owned home, vehicle, travel — all documented with ministry purpose. Personal use reported as taxable income. |
| **The US founder is NOT a PIF beneficiary or owner** | This eliminates CFC, GILTI, Subpart F, Form 5471 entirely. Non-negotiable for the US founder's position. |
| **Transfer pricing is arm's length** | All intercompany agreements (Holdings↔Studio, Holdings↔Mexico, CI↔Studio, content license, spiritual tech license) supported by TP documentation. |
| **The CI IBC has ZERO employees** | Employees create PE. The CI IBC's 0% rate depends on having no physical presence anywhere. Non-negotiable. |
| **Mexico OpCo NEVER pays CI IBC directly** | REFIPRE triggers 40% WHT. All TE ecosystem services from LB route through Holdings and Studio. |
| **CI IBC subcontracts ALL development to Studio** | The CI IBC sells; Studio builds. Preserves Studio substance and CI IBC's thin profile. |
| **TE Holdings contracts with Studio (not employs)** | Holdings has zero employees. All development performed by Studio under Development Services Agreement. |
| **Investor equity in TE Holdings only** | Investor has no claim on Studio, CI IBC, Church, or PIF. Dilution isolated to TE. |
| **Mexico OpCo owned by TE Holdings** | Holdings controls all TE operations. Studio has no ownership of operating entities. |

*This document describes a legal tax optimization structure combining Cayman tax exemption, UAE free zone benefits, Cook Islands IBC tax neutrality, US religious organization provisions, Panamanian asset protection, and Mexican corporate tax law. All mechanisms cited are explicit provisions of the relevant tax codes. Implementation requires validation by qualified counsel in each jurisdiction. The religious framework must be genuine and predate the tax strategy.*
