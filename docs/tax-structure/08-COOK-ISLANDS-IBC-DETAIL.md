# Cook Islands IBC: Light Brands Consulting Ltd — Operating Detail

> **Status:** Entity specification — requires Cook Islands counsel + UAE counsel validation
> **Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## 1. Summary

Light Brands Consulting Ltd is a Cook Islands International Business Company (IBC) that serves as the client-facing entity for all external consulting, SaaS, and product sales outside the TE healing center ecosystem. It signs contracts with external clients, collects revenue, owns LB-specific IP, and subcontracts all development to the UAE entity. It has zero employees, zero office space, and zero physical presence — by design. This "thin" entity structure preserves its unconditional 0% tax rate on international income while the UAE entity provides all operational substance.

## 2. Why Cook Islands (Not Other Jurisdictions)

| Jurisdiction | Tax on International Income | Substance Required? | Asset Protection | OECD/FATF/EU Standing | Annual Cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cook Islands** | **0%** (unconditional for IBCs) | **No** — no employees, office, or local activity required | **#1 globally** (2-year statute of limitations, fraudulent transfer burden on creditor, no foreign judgment recognition) | Clean — not on EU blacklist, FATF compliant, TIEA signatory | ~$3-5K | **Selected** |
| BVI | 0% | No | Good but weaker than CI | EU blacklisted (removed 2023, watch list risk) | ~$2-4K | EU risk |
| Cayman | 0% | No (but increasing pressure) | Good | Clean, but OECD pressure increasing | ~$5-8K | Higher cost, more scrutiny |
| Panama IBC | 0% (territorial) | No | Good (different from PIF) | EU greylist risk | ~$2-3K | Having PIF + IBC in same jurisdiction looks like layering |
| Seychelles | 0% | No | Moderate | FATF greylist | ~$1-2K | Reputational risk |
| Nevis | 0% | No | Excellent | Limited banking relationships | ~$2-3K | Banking difficulty |

**Cook Islands wins on three dimensions:**

1. **Asset protection** — strongest in the world. The International Trusts Act 1984 (as amended) and the International Companies Act 1981-82 create a jurisdiction where: creditors face a 2-year statute of limitations from the date of transfer (not discovery), must prove fraudulent intent beyond reasonable doubt (not preponderance), and foreign court judgments are not recognized or enforceable.

2. **Clean international standing** — the Cook Islands is not on any EU blacklist or FATF greylist. It has signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) and participates in CRS/AEOI. This is critical for banking relationships and intercompany transactions.

3. **Zero substance requirements** — unlike jurisdictions facing increasing economic substance demands (Cayman ESR, BVI Economic Substance Act), Cook Islands IBCs have no minimum substance requirements for international business. The entity can be a pure holding/IP/contracting vehicle.

## 3. IBC Formation and Governance

### Formation Requirements

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Governing law** | Cook Islands International Companies Act 1981-82 |
| **Registered agent** | Required — must be a licensed CI trustee company |
| **Registered office** | At the registered agent's address in Rarotonga |
| **Directors** | Minimum 1 director. Can be corporate or individual. No CI residency requirement. **Critical: fewer than 3 CI-resident directors** to avoid local tax obligations. |
| **Shareholders** | Minimum 1. Panamanian Holdings S.A. (100% PIF-owned Panama corporation) is sole shareholder. |
| **Secretary** | Optional (recommended for governance) |
| **Share capital** | Flexible — standard is USD $10,000 authorized, $1 issued |
| **Public registry** | Company name, registered agent, date of incorporation. Directors and shareholders are NOT public. |
| **Formation time** | 2-5 business days |
| **Formation cost** | ~$1,500-2,500 (agent fees + government fees) |

### Director Structure (Recommended)

| Director | Role | Residence |
|---|---|---|
| Professional corporate director (nominee) | Day-to-day signing authority for routine matters | Cook Islands or Singapore |
| Canadian founder | Strategic direction (via board resolutions) | UAE |

**Key constraint:** The CI IBC must NOT have 3 or more Cook Islands-resident directors. Under the International Companies Act, a company with 3+ CI-resident directors becomes subject to Cook Islands domestic tax law. Keep CI-resident directors to 1 (the nominee) or 0.

### Annual Requirements

| Requirement | Detail | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Annual return | Filed with Registrar via registered agent | Included in agent fee |
| Registered agent fee | Annual maintenance | ~$1,500-2,500/yr |
| Government annual fee | License renewal | ~$300-500/yr |
| Financial statements | Not required to be filed (keep internally for intercompany TP) | — |
| Audit | Not required | — |
| **Total annual cost** | | **~$2,500-4,000** |

## 4. Tax Treatment

### Income Tax

| Income Type | Tax Rate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| International consulting revenue | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| International SaaS/subscription revenue | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Royalty income (from licensing IP) | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Interest income | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Capital gains | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Dividends received | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |

### Withholding Tax

| Payment Type | WHT Rate |
|---|---|
| Dividends paid by CI IBC to Panamanian Holdings S.A. | **0%** |
| Royalties paid by CI IBC to any entity | **0%** |
| Service fees paid by CI IBC to UAE entity | **0%** |
| Interest paid by CI IBC | **0%** |

**The 0% is unconditional for IBCs.** There is no minimum substance requirement, no qualifying activity test, and no revenue threshold. As long as the entity does not conduct business with Cook Islands residents or hold Cook Islands real property, the 0% rate applies.

### What Would Break the 0% Rate

| Action | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Conducting business with CI residents | Subject to CI domestic tax |
| Holding CI real property | Subject to CI property tax |
| Having 3+ CI-resident directors | Company becomes domestically taxable |
| Employees physically located in CI | Creates CI substance — potential domestic tax |

None of these apply to Light Brands Consulting Ltd.

## 5. IP Ownership and Work-for-Hire Structure

### How LB IP Is Created

1. **CI IBC commissions the work** — CI IBC enters into a Development Subcontract with the UAE entity
2. **UAE entity builds it** — the Dubai team (employees of the UAE entity) develops the software, frameworks, tools
3. **IP transfers to CI IBC upon delivery** — the subcontract specifies that all IP in the deliverables is assigned to CI IBC as the commissioning party (work-for-hire / IP assignment clause)
4. **CI IBC owns the IP** — it can license, sell, or distribute as it sees fit

### Why This Structure Works

- **UAE entity retains DEMPE substance** for TE-related IP (healing center platform, AI agents, etc.)
- **CI IBC is the commissioning entity** for LB-related IP — this is a standard client→contractor IP arrangement
- **No IP migration issues** — the IP was never "in" the UAE entity. It was created under contract for CI IBC from inception
- **TP defensibility** — the subcontract fee (cost + margin) is the arm's length price for development services. Standard comparables exist (IT outsourcing benchmarks)

### IP Licensing to Church

| License | From | To | Type | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spiritual technology tools | CI IBC | Church | Royalty license | Arm's length (TP study) |
| Consciousness platforms | CI IBC | Church | Royalty license | Arm's length (TP study) |

**Church treatment:** Royalty income received by a 508(c)(1)(A) church is UBIT-exempt under IRC 512(b)(2), provided the underlying property is not debt-financed. The church licenses the tools for its spiritual mission — distributing consciousness technology to its congregation.

**Pricing:** The royalty rate must be defensible. Comparable rates for software/technology licensing to nonprofits typically range from 5-15% of revenue generated using the licensed technology. A TP study should establish the specific rate.

## 6. Subcontracting Relationship with UAE Entity

### Structure

```
Light Brands Consulting Ltd (CI IBC) — "The Voice"
    Signs client contract (consulting, SaaS, products)
    Collects client payment
    Subcontracts delivery to:

Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC (Dubai) — "The Builder"
    Provides all development, implementation, support
    Uses Dubai team (engineers, AI/ML, PM)
    Bills CI IBC at cost + arm's length margin
    Delivers work product with IP assigned to CI IBC
```

**Shared service center model:** Studio also provides development services to TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) under a separate Development Services Agreement. This shared service center model — Studio building for both TE Holdings and CI IBC — strengthens Studio's DEMPE substance (the team genuinely develops for multiple clients) and its QFZP position (pure B2B service company earning fees from corporate entities). The dual-client model also provides natural arm's length pricing comparables between the two development contracts.

### Key Contractual Terms

| Term | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | All software development, consulting delivery, implementation, and technical support for LB clients |
| **Pricing** | Cost-plus method (developer cost + 15-25% markup). Benchmarked against IT outsourcing comparables. |
| **IP assignment** | All deliverables and IP created under the subcontract are assigned to CI IBC |
| **Payment terms** | Monthly or per-milestone, in USD |
| **Term** | Rolling annual, with project-specific SOWs |
| **Dispute resolution** | Arbitration (Singapore International Arbitration Centre or Dubai equivalent) |

### Transfer Pricing Considerations

The CI IBC → UAE subcontract must withstand TP scrutiny from any authority examining either entity:

- **Comparable method:** Cost-plus using IT outsourcing benchmarks (Deloitte Global Outsourcing Survey, NASSCOM data)
- **Target margin for UAE entity:** 15-25% on fully loaded cost (includes salaries, office, equipment, overhead)
- **Documentation:** Annual TP study with contemporaneous documentation
- **Functional analysis:** UAE entity performs development functions, assumes technical risk. CI IBC performs entrepreneurial functions (client acquisition, market risk, IP ownership)

## 7. Banking and Payment Processing

### Primary Banking

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Singapore bank (recommended)** | Strong banking jurisdiction, CI IBCs accepted by several banks, multi-currency, Wise integration | Requires in-person account opening (Singapore trip) |
| **Hong Kong bank** | Good for Asia-Pacific clients | Longer account opening process |
| **UAE bank (secondary)** | Close to the team, easy transfers to UAE entity | Some UAE banks cautious with CI entities |

**Recommended approach:** Open primary account at a Singapore bank (DBS, OCBC, or digital-first bank like Aspire/Statrys). Singapore banks are accustomed to servicing IBCs from clean jurisdictions.

### Payment Processing

| Method | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Stripe (Singapore entity)** | SaaS subscriptions, recurring billing |
| **Wise Business** | International wire transfers, multi-currency receiving |
| **Direct bank transfer** | Large consulting engagements, enterprise clients |

### KYC Documentation Required

Banks will require:

- Certificate of Incorporation
- Certificate of Good Standing
- Memorandum and Articles of Association
- Register of Directors and Shareholders (certified by registered agent)
- UBO declaration (identifying S.A. → PIF → founders chain)
- PIF documentation (Certificate of Registration, Foundation Charter)
- S.A. documentation (Certificate of Incorporation, board resolution, Articles of Incorporation)
- Founder passports + proof of address
- Business plan / description of activities
- Source of funds letter

## 8. Asset Protection Features

The Cook Islands is consistently ranked as the **#1 asset protection jurisdiction globally**. Key features:

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Statute of limitations** | Creditors must bring fraudulent transfer claims within **2 years** of the transfer — not 2 years from discovery |
| **Burden of proof** | Creditor must prove fraudulent intent **beyond reasonable doubt** (criminal standard, not civil) |
| **Foreign judgments** | **Not recognized or enforceable.** Creditor must re-litigate in Cook Islands courts under Cook Islands law. |
| **Forum non conveniens** | CI courts will not decline jurisdiction in favor of foreign courts |
| **No contempt enforcement** | CI courts will not enforce foreign contempt orders compelling asset disclosure or transfer |
| **Duress defense** | If a settlor/director is compelled by a foreign court to repatriate assets, the Cook Islands trustee/director can legally refuse — the foreign order constitutes duress under CI law |

### Key Precedents

| Case | Year | Holding |
|---|---|---|
| *FTC v. Affordable Media* | 1999 | US court held trustee in contempt, but CI trustee legally refused to comply — assets protected |
| *In re Huber* | 2013 | US bankruptcy court attempted to reach CI trust assets — CI protections held |

### Why This Matters for TE

- **Litigation shield:** If a disgruntled client, competitor, or government entity sues, LB's revenue and IP are in a jurisdiction where foreign judgments have no force
- **Founder protection:** The PIF → S.A. → CI IBC chain creates three layers of asset protection (Panama PIF privacy + S.A. corporate veil + Cook Islands enforcement immunity)
- **Separation from TE operations:** Even if the TE healing center faces liability (medical malpractice, guest injury), LB assets in the CI IBC are structurally isolated

## 9. CRS/AEOI and International Reporting

The Cook Islands participates in the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). This means:

| Reporting Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What is reported** | Account holder identity, account balance, income (interest, dividends, gross proceeds) |
| **Reported to whom** | Cook Islands Inland Revenue → OECD exchange network → participating jurisdictions |
| **Who reports** | CI financial institutions (banks, trust companies) |
| **Impact on CI IBC** | The CI IBC's bank (Singapore or elsewhere) reports to its local authority, which exchanges with CI and the founders' resident jurisdictions |
| **Impact on founders** | Founders must report CI IBC interests on personal tax returns (FBAR for US founder, equivalent for others) |

**This is not a problem.** CRS/AEOI ensures transparency, which actually strengthens the structure's defensibility. The 0% tax rate is a sovereign policy choice, not evasion. Full reporting compliance demonstrates the structure is not trying to hide anything.

## 10. Cost Analysis

### Formation (One-Time)

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Government registration fee | ~$300-500 |
| Registered agent setup fee | ~$1,000-1,500 |
| Legal review of Articles | ~$500-1,000 |
| Nominee director setup (if used) | ~$500-1,000 |
| Bank account opening (Singapore trip) | ~$1,500-2,500 (travel + bank fees) |
| **Total formation** | **~$3,800-6,500** |

### Annual Ongoing

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Registered agent annual fee | ~$1,500-2,500 |
| Government annual license fee | ~$300-500 |
| Nominee director fee | ~$500-1,000 |
| Bank account maintenance | ~$200-500 |
| Transfer pricing study (CI↔UAE) | ~$5,000-10,000 (shared with UAE TP study) |
| **Total annual** | **~$7,500-14,500** |

### Cost in Context

At even modest Light Brands revenue ($500K/year), the annual cost of maintaining the CI IBC (~$10K) represents a 2% overhead — while the entity generates a 0% tax rate on all international income. At $2M+ revenue, the overhead drops below 0.5%.
