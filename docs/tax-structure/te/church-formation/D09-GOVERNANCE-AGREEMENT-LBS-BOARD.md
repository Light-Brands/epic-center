## Preamble

Governance is stewardship made visible. When the Church of the Living Light takes a seat on the board of Light Brands Studio, it is not claiming power — it is accepting responsibility. The Church's economic interest in LBS is not passive. It is participatory. The 30% profit participation and the board seat are two expressions of the same truth: what the Church has been given, the Church is called to protect.

This Governance Agreement implements Principles 13 and 14 of the Governing Framework. Principle 13 says: the Church shall have governance rights commensurate with its economic interest. Principle 14 says: if anyone else gets more, the Church gets more too. Together, these principles ensure that the Church is never an afterthought in the decisions that shape the entity it has been entrusted to steward.

Every vote cast by the Church's representative is an act of sacred responsibility. Every veto exercised is a boundary drawn in service of the mission. The Church does not govern to control. It governs to protect — the mission, the people, the integrity of what has been built.

### 3.4 Governance Pause Provision

---

## 5. Veto Rights

### 5.1 Church Consent Required

The following actions require the prior written consent of the Church (acting through its Church Representative or directly through the Spiritual Council). Neither LBS, S.A., nor PIF shall take or authorize any of the following without the Church's consent:

| Action Requiring Church Consent | Rationale |
|--------------------------------|-----------|
| **Sale, merger, or consolidation** of LBS or substantially all of its assets | Protects the Church's 30% exit participation and ensures the Church is not forced into a transaction without its agreement |
| **New debt** above $[________] (threshold to be set) | Prevents debt that could subordinate the Church's PPA distributions or impair LBS's ability to pay |
| **Related-party transactions** between LBS and any director, officer, PPA holder, S.A., PIF, or their affiliates | Prevents self-dealing that could divert value away from PPA holders |
| **New PPA issuance** or creation of new economic interests | Protects the Church from dilution of its 30% participation |
| **Material change of business** — any change in LBS's core business activities that would fundamentally alter its operations or revenue model | Ensures the Church's PPA remains tied to the business it agreed to participate in |
| **Executive compensation** above $[________] per individual per year (threshold to be set) | Prevents excessive compensation that could reduce Distributable Profits |

### 5.2 Veto Process

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Notice** | LBS shall provide the Church Representative with written notice of any proposed action requiring Church consent at least twenty (20) business days before the proposed action |
| **Information** | The notice shall include all material information necessary for the Church to evaluate the proposed action |
| **Deliberation** | The Church Representative may consult with the Spiritual Council before responding |
| **Response** | The Church shall respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days of receiving the notice. Failure to respond within this period shall be deemed a withholding of consent. |
| **Good faith** | The Church shall exercise its veto rights in good faith, consistent with its fiduciary duties as a PPA holder and its sacred mission |

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **FZ-LLC governance authority:** Under Dubai Internet City / DAFZA regulations, can a Free Zone LLC grant a contractual board seat with veto rights to a non-member? Or must the Church be admitted as a member of the FZ-LLC? If membership is required, what are the implications for the phantom equity structure?

2. **Veto enforceability:** Are contractual veto rights enforceable against an FZ-LLC under UAE law? Would DIFC Courts enforce a specific performance order requiring LBS to obtain Church consent before taking a vetoed action?

3. **Threshold amounts:** Counsel to recommend specific dollar thresholds for the debt ceiling and executive compensation veto triggers based on LBS's projected operations and revenue.

4. **Governance Pause interaction:** During a Governance Pause, Jennifer Lawless (or her designee) represents the Church on the LBS board. Does this require advance notice to LBS? Should LBS's constitutional documents be amended to acknowledge this automatic succession mechanism?

5. **Director vs. representative:** Under UAE/DAFZA law, is the Church Representative formally a "director" of LBS, or an observer/representative with contractual rights? The distinction may matter for director liability, fiduciary duties, and insurance.

6. **PIF/S.A. consent:** S.A. (as 100% legal owner of LBS) and PIF (as 100% owner of S.A.) must be parties to ensure they do not obstruct the Church's governance rights. Confirm this three-party structure is enforceable under Panama and UAE law.

7. **MFN retroactivity:** If LBS grants improved governance rights to another PPA holder and fails to notify the Church within 30 days, can the retroactive amendment mechanism be enforced in DIFC Courts?

8. **Interaction with D03 PPA:** This Agreement is a standalone governance instrument, but it references and supplements D03. Should it be incorporated by reference into D03, or remain independent? Which approach gives stronger enforcement?
