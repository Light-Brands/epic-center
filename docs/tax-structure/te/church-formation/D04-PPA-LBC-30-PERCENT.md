## 1. Parties (Delta from D03 Section 1)

| Party | Description |
|-------|------------|
| **The Church** | Church of the Living Light, a 508(c)(1)(A) tax-exempt church organized under the laws of [State], acting through its Spiritual Council |
| **LBC** | Light Brands Consulting Ltd, an International Business Company organized under the International Companies Act 1981-82 of the Cook Islands |
| **S.A.** | Panamanian Holdings S.A., a Sociedad Anonima organized under the laws of the Republic of Panama, 100% legal owner of LBC |
| **PIF** | [Name of Panama Private Interest Foundation], an independent legal person organized under Law 25 of 1995 of the Republic of Panama, 100% owner of S.A. |

All other recitals follow D03 Section 2, substituting "LBC" for "LBS" and "Cook Islands IBC" for "Dubai FZ-LLC" throughout.

## 2. Principle 13: Governance Rights (Delta)

| Element | D03 Term | D04 Delta |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Board seat** | Church holds one seat on Board of Directors of LBS | LBC uses nominee directors per Cook Islands law. Church does **not** hold a statutory board seat. |
| **Advisory Board** | Not applicable | Church holds one seat on the Advisory Board of LBC. Advisory Board has contractual governance authority equivalent to a board seat. See [D10](./D10-ADVISORY-BOARD-AGREEMENT-LBC.md). |
| **Appointment** | Spiritual Council appoints board representative | Spiritual Council appoints Advisory Board representative |
| **Veto rights** | Same as D03 — all veto rights preserved | Identical veto rights exercised through Advisory Board mechanism. LBC nominee directors are contractually required to follow Advisory Board resolutions on veto matters. |
| **Observer rights** | Church representative attends all LBS board meetings | Church representative attends all LBC board and Advisory Board meetings |

**Why the difference:** Cook Islands IBCs commonly use nominee directors for privacy and asset protection. A direct board seat would undermine the nominee structure. The Advisory Board agreement (D10) provides the Church with equivalent governance power through contractual authority that binds the nominee directors.

## 3. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution (Delta from D03 Section 8)

| Element | D03 Term | D04 Delta |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Governing law** | Laws of the UAE / DIFC | Laws of the Cook Islands, specifically the International Companies Act 1981-82 |
| **Primary jurisdiction** | DIFC Courts | Cook Islands High Court |
| **Alternative** | LCIA arbitration (London/Singapore) | Arbitration under SIAC Rules (Singapore International Arbitration Centre), seated in Singapore, with three arbitrators |
| **Language** | English | English |
| **Interim relief** | Any court of competent jurisdiction | Any court of competent jurisdiction, including Cook Islands High Court |

---

## 4. Asset Protection (Delta — No D03 Equivalent)

The Cook Islands jurisdiction provides asset protection features that exceed those available in the UAE:

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Foreign judgments** | Not recognized or enforceable against Cook Islands IBCs under the International Companies Act |
| **Statute of limitations** | Fraudulent transfer claims must be brought within one (1) year of the transfer (Cook Islands, vs. longer periods in most jurisdictions) |
| **Burden of proof** | Creditor must prove fraudulent intent beyond a reasonable doubt (criminal standard, not civil standard) |
| **Settlor insolvency** | Insolvency of the PIF founder or S.A. shareholder does not give creditors access to LBC assets |

**Why this matters for the Church:** The Church's PPA in LBC benefits from the strongest asset protection regime available. A US judgment creditor of Daniel (or any other party) cannot reach LBC assets or the Church's PPA distribution stream through a foreign judgment.

---

## 5. LBC Operational Model (Delta — No Direct D03 Equivalent)

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Employees** | Zero — LBC has no employees |
| **Operations** | Pure contracting and IP holding entity |
| **Service delivery** | LBC subcontracts all operational work to LBS (Dubai) via arm's-length intercompany service agreement |
| **Revenue sources** | Consulting fees, IP licensing royalties, subcontracted service margins |
| **Transfer pricing** | All intercompany transactions at arm's length — documented per OECD guidelines |

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Advisory Board enforceability:** Will Cook Islands courts enforce a contractual Advisory Board mechanism that binds nominee directors? Is there precedent for this structure under the International Companies Act?
2. **Nominee director obligations:** Can nominee directors be contractually required to follow Advisory Board resolutions on veto matters, or does this conflict with their fiduciary duties under Cook Islands law?
3. **SIAC arbitration:** Is Singapore the optimal arbitration seat for Cook Islands entity disputes? Would Auckland or another Pacific jurisdiction be more practical?
4. **Foreign judgment non-recognition:** Confirm that the Cook Islands' non-recognition of foreign judgments applies to contractual PPA claims (not just trust/asset protection claims).
5. **Tax treatment:** Confirm that PPA distributions from a Cook Islands IBC to a US 508(c)(1)(A) church are (a) not subject to Cook Islands withholding tax, and (b) UBIT-exempt under IRC 512(b)(2).
6. **Registered agent selection:** Identify appropriate Cook Islands registered agent for LBC. Agent must be licensed under the International Companies Act.
7. **Intercompany transfer pricing:** Confirm that LBC-to-LBS subcontracting arrangement satisfies both Cook Islands and UAE transfer pricing requirements.
