## Purpose

This document provides the template for the Compensation Committee's first official act: the initial determination of compensation for all Church personnel. These resolutions must be adopted **before the first tax year begins** — meaning before any minister or staff member receives any form of compensation from the Church. Retroactive compensation determinations do not qualify for the rebuttable presumption under 26 CFR 53.4958-6.

The church gives because the ministers serve. The ministers serve because they are called. This resolution does not create an entitlement. It honors a covenant — the sacred reciprocity between those who dedicate their lives to the mission and the community that sustains them.

Every dollar amount in this document has been reviewed against comparable data from organizations of similar size, scope, and mission. Every determination has been made by independent individuals with no personal stake in the outcome. Every vote has been cast in the absence of the person whose compensation is being determined. This is what makes the shield real.

## CRITICAL TIMING REQUIREMENT

> **These resolutions MUST be adopted BEFORE the Church's first tax year begins.**
>
> If the Church's fiscal year runs January 1 - December 31, these resolutions must be adopted no later than December 31 of the year preceding the first tax year. If the Church is formed mid-year, these resolutions must be adopted before the first day on which any minister or staff member receives compensation.
>
> Housing allowance designations (Resolution 2) are **always prospective** under IRC 107 — they cannot be applied retroactively to any period before the date of adoption.
>
> Failure to adopt compensation resolutions before the first tax year begins means: (1) the rebuttable presumption does not attach to any compensation paid during the gap period, and (2) housing allowance exclusions claimed for the gap period may be invalid.

### Preamble

**WHEREAS,** the Committee has obtained and reviewed comparable compensation data from the following sources:

**WHEREAS,** the Committee has deliberated independently, reviewed the comparable data, considered the total compensation package value against comparables, and determined that the following compensation is reasonable for the Senior Pastor of a church with projected Year 1 revenue of approximately $[110,000];

### Resolved

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** that the Compensation Committee of the Church of the Living Light hereby approves the following initial compensation package for **Daniel Lawless, Senior Pastor**, effective for the tax year beginning [January 1, 20__]:

| Component | Annual Amount (Year 1) | Tax Treatment | Comparable Basis |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Minister Salary** | $[80,000] | Taxable ordinary income | NACBA median for churches with $100K-$250K budget: $[X]. Committee set at [percentile]. |

### Comparable Data Certification

The Committee certifies that:

(a) It obtained and reviewed comparable compensation data from no fewer than three (3) independent sources before making this determination;

(b) The total compensation package falls within the range established by comparable data for senior pastors at churches of similar size, revenue, and mission scope;

(c) The Committee considered the Church's projected revenue growth trajectory and the Senior Pastor's role as the primary driver of the Church's ministry, content, and revenue;

(d) The Senior Pastor was not present during deliberation or voting;

(e) This determination was made by majority vote of the Committee.

### Rationale

[The Committee shall insert its specific rationale here, explaining why the approved amounts are reasonable. The rationale should address: (a) how the Church's size and revenue compare to the comparable organizations, (b) why the total package value is appropriate given the Senior Pastor's scope of responsibilities, (c) any adjustments made to account for the Church's early-stage status, and (d) the anticipated growth in Church revenue that supports scaling compensation in future years.]

The Housing Allowance Designation for Daniel Lawless (and other eligible ministers) is adopted concurrently with this Resolution and is set forth in full in **[B03 Housing Allowance Designation](./B03-HOUSING-ALLOWANCE-DESIGNATION.md)**.

The Committee confirms that the housing allowance designation of $[80,000] for the Senior Pastor is included within the total compensation package evaluated in Resolution 1 and is supported by the comparable data reviewed.

**WHEREAS,** Timothy Lawless serves as Director of Operations & Administration and Church Treasurer, responsible for: financial oversight, vendor management, facility maintenance, compliance calendar, banking relationships, bookkeeping oversight, payroll administration, and chairing the Finance Committee;

### Resolved

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** that the Compensation Committee hereby approves the following initial compensation package for **Timothy Lawless, Director of Operations & Administration / Treasurer**, effective for the tax year beginning [January 1, 20__]:

### Note on Disqualified Person Status

Timothy Lawless is a disqualified person under IRC 4958(f)(1)(B) (family member — sibling of the Senior Pastor). The rebuttable presumption process is therefore especially important for Timothy's compensation determination. The Committee has followed all six steps of the Charter process and documented comparable data supporting the reasonableness of this compensation.

## RESOLUTION 5 — CONTINGENT COMPENSATION: ASSOCIATE PASTOR (JASON SPARKS — IF OPTION C/D)

### Preamble

**WHEREAS,** under the Transformational Epicenter structure, Jason Sparks may elect Option C or Option D, which would include service as Associate Pastor of the Church of the Living Light and irrevocable assignment of his 10% Profit Participation Agreements in LBS and LBC to the Church;

**WHEREAS,** this Resolution is contingent upon Jason Sparks' election of Option C or Option D and his assumption of the Associate Pastor role;

**WHEREAS,** if and when Jason Sparks assumes the Associate Pastor role, the Committee will conduct a full compensation determination following the Charter process, including updated comparable data;

### Resolved

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** that the Compensation Committee hereby establishes the following **preliminary compensation framework** for Jason Sparks, to be finalized upon his election of Option C or Option D:

| Component | Preliminary Range | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| **Associate Pastor Salary** | $[40,000 - 80,000] | Proportionate to role scope. Jason's PPA (10%) is approximately one-third of Daniel's PPA (30%). Salary proportionality should reflect role scope, not PPA ratio. |
| **Housing Allowance (IRC 107)** | $[Amount — TBD] | Subject to ordination. See Document B03. |
| **Retirement Plan Contributions** | $[Amount — TBD] | Subject to plan establishment. |
| **Total Preliminary Range** | **$[40,000 - 80,000+]** | Final determination requires full six-step Charter process upon Jason's assumption of the role. |

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that this preliminary framework does not constitute a binding compensation determination. A binding determination will be made only after: (a) Jason Sparks formally elects Option C or Option D, (b) Jason Sparks assumes the Associate Pastor role, (c) the Committee obtains updated comparable data, and (d) the Committee conducts a full deliberation and vote under the Charter process.

**WHEREAS,** the Committee has reviewed comparable data for church outreach directors and secretaries;

### Resolved

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** that the Compensation Committee determines the following for Nancy Courchesne:

| Component | Year 1 Determination | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Council Service** | Voluntary (no compensation) | Council governance service is uncompensated in Year 1 |
| **Secretary Duties** | Voluntary / nominal stipend: $[0 - 5,000] | Record-keeping, minutes, filing duties |

## RESOLUTION 8 — GENERAL PROVISIONS

**BE IT RESOLVED** that the following general provisions apply to all compensation determinations in this document:

(a) **Effective Date.** All compensation packages are effective as of [January 1, 20__], or the first day of the Church's first tax year, whichever is later. No compensation shall be paid for any period before the effective date of these resolutions.

(b) **Payroll.** All taxable compensation shall be paid through the Church's payroll system, with appropriate withholding for federal and state income taxes. Ministers who have filed Form 4361 (exemption from self-employment tax) are exempt from FICA withholding.

(c) **W-2 Reporting.** The Church shall issue Form W-2 to all compensated personnel. Housing allowance amounts are reported in Box 14 of Form W-2 (informational) but are excluded from taxable wages in Boxes 1, 3, and 5 (to the extent of the IRC 107 exclusion).

(d) **Annual Review.** All compensation packages are subject to annual review by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the Charter (Document B01). These initial amounts are Year 1 determinations and are expected to be adjusted annually based on comparable data, Church revenue, and role scope.

(e) **No Retroactive Application.** No compensation determination in these resolutions shall be applied retroactively to any period before the date of adoption. All designations — particularly housing allowance designations under IRC 107 — are prospective only.

(f) **Bracketed Amounts.** All dollar amounts shown in brackets — $[X] — are placeholders for the Committee to fill in during the official adoption meeting based on final comparable data review. These amounts represent the framework ranges discussed during the preparation of these resolutions but are not binding until adopted by formal Committee vote.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Year 1 compensation-to-revenue ratio:** With projected Year 1 Church revenue of ~$110,000, the Senior Pastor's total package ($207,000) significantly exceeds revenue. Counsel should advise on whether this ratio is defensible given: (a) the Church is newly formed and investing in ministry leadership, (b) revenue is projected to grow substantially in Years 2-5, and (c) comparable churches in their founding years often had compensation exceeding revenue. Should the Committee document the growth trajectory explicitly in the rationale?
2. **Retirement plan contribution limits:** Confirm applicable limits for 403(b)(9) and 457(b) contributions in the first tax year. Are the bracketed amounts within statutory limits?
3. **Form 4361 timing:** When must the Senior Pastor file Form 4361 (application for exemption from self-employment tax) to secure the SE tax opt-out? Must it be filed before the first tax year or within a specific window?
4. **Jennifer's ordination pathway:** If Jennifer completes ordination in Year 2, can a housing allowance designation be added mid-year, or must it wait for the next full tax year?
5. **Contingent resolution validity:** Is Resolution 5 (Jason Sparks contingent compensation) appropriate as a framework, or should the Committee adopt no resolution until Jason formally elects Option C/D?
6. **Bracketed amounts:** Counsel should review all bracketed amounts against current comparable data and advise the Committee on final figures before adoption.
