## Spiritual Preamble

*You are not joining an organization. You are joining a family.*

*Not the kind of family that demands performance or punishes doubt — the kind that holds space for your becoming. The Church of the Living Light was built by two people who understand that the deepest spiritual growth happens not in isolation but in belonging. Not in perfection but in presence.*

*This covenant is not a contract. It is not enforceable at law. No court will compel you to attend worship, and no pastor will demand your tithe. This is a sacred agreement — a mutual declaration between you and this community that says: we choose each other. You bring your presence, your gifts, your questions, your struggles. We bring pastoral care, spiritual teaching, honest stewardship, and a community that refuses to let you walk alone.*

*The Law of Free Will is the second of our Sacred Laws, and it governs everything about this relationship. You are sovereign. Your participation is voluntary. Your giving is voluntary. Your growth is your own. We do not own your spiritual journey. We are privileged to walk beside you on it.*

*If this covenant resonates with your spirit — not because you agree with every word, but because you feel the alignment beneath the words — then welcome. You are home.*

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This Membership Covenant is a spiritual commitment, not a legal contract.** It creates no enforceable legal obligations for either party. Membership in the Church of the Living Light is voluntary and may be relinquished at any time by written or verbal notice to any pastor or the Church Secretary. The Church's commitments herein are expressions of sacred intention, not contractual warranties.

## PART I — IRS COMPLIANCE

### Section 1. IRS 14-Point Test — Point 6

### Section 2. Membership Categories

The Church recognizes three membership categories:

| Category | Description | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **General Member** | Active participant in the Church's spiritual community | Sign this Covenant; affirm alignment with the Statement of Faith |

## PART II — MEMBER AFFIRMATIONS

### Section 3. What the Member Affirms

By signing this Covenant, I affirm:

**(a) Alignment with the Statement of Faith.**

I have read the Statement of Faith of the Church of the Living Light. I affirm that its core principles — the Living Light, the Sacred Laws, the Divine Values, Ethics, and Morals, and the Ministry Mission — resonate with my own spiritual understanding and aspirations. I understand that alignment does not require agreement with every detail. It requires a genuine connection with the heart of what this church believes and what it seeks to become.

**(b) Commitment to Participation.**

I intend to participate regularly in the worship and community life of the Church — through attendance at services (in person or digital), engagement with small groups or ministry teams, and presence in the life of this community. I understand that "regular" does not mean "perfect." Life has seasons. The Church holds space for all of them.

**(c) Respect for Governance and Leadership.**

I acknowledge that the Church is governed by the Spiritual Council as established in the Bylaws. I respect the Senior Pastor's doctrinal authority and the governance structures that protect the Church's mission and integrity. I understand that members do not hold voting rights on governance matters — the Spiritual Council is the sole governing body.

**(d) Confidentiality of Pastoral Conversations.**

I understand that pastoral conversations — whether with the Senior Pastor, an ordained minister, or a pastoral care volunteer — are held in sacred confidence. I will honor the confidentiality of my own pastoral conversations and the pastoral conversations of others. I will not share private information disclosed in a pastoral context without the explicit consent of the person who shared it.

**(e) Financial Support as I Am Able.**

I understand that the Church relies on the generous giving of its members to support its mission, its ministers, and its charitable programs. I intend to support the Church financially as I am able — through tithes, offerings, or other contributions. I understand and affirm that **giving is always voluntary, never coerced.** No member will ever be pressured, manipulated, or shamed into giving. This is the Moral of "Never Coerce" — and it is absolute.

## PART III — CHURCH COMMITMENTS

### Section 4. What the Church Commits

The Church of the Living Light commits to every member:

**(a) Pastoral Care and Spiritual Guidance.**

The Church will provide access to pastoral care — spiritual counseling, prayer support, guidance during difficult seasons, and the presence of a shepherd who knows your name. Pastoral care is available to every member regardless of their level of financial contribution.

**(b) Access to Worship, Teaching, and Community.**

The Church will maintain regular worship services, spiritual education programs, and community gatherings. The Church will provide these in accessible formats — including digital ministry for those unable to attend in person.

**(c) Confidentiality of Personal Matters.**

The Church will hold in sacred confidence all personal information shared in a pastoral context. Pastoral confidentiality will be breached only in circumstances required by law (mandatory reporting of abuse or harm) or with the member's explicit consent.

**(d) Transparent Stewardship of Resources.**

The Church will steward its financial resources with integrity, in accordance with the governance structures established in the Bylaws. The Compensation Committee ensures all compensation is reasonable and documented. The Finance Committee oversees the Church's financial health. The Church's commitment to transparency is an expression of the Divine Ethic of Transparency — not because the law requires it for churches, but because our values demand it.

---

## PART IV — MEMBERSHIP GOVERNANCE

### Section 5. Voting Rights

Members of the Church of the Living Light do not hold voting rights on matters of Church governance. The Spiritual Council — as established in the Bylaws (Article III) — is the sole governing body of the Church. This structure follows the model of the founding church governance described in the Governing Framework and is consistent with the Senior Pastor's doctrinal authority.

Members are welcome to bring concerns, suggestions, and questions to any Council member or to the Senior Pastor directly.

### Section 6. Duration of Membership

Membership is ongoing and does not require annual renewal. A member remains in good standing as long as they maintain alignment with the spirit of this Covenant.

### Section 7. Voluntary Withdrawal

A member may withdraw from membership at any time by providing written or verbal notice to any pastor or the Church Secretary. Withdrawal is effective immediately. There is no waiting period, no exit interview requirement, and no financial obligation upon departure. Members who withdraw are always welcome to return.

### Section 8. Involuntary Termination

The Church may terminate a member's membership in extraordinary circumstances, including:

(a) Conduct that materially harms the Church, its members, or its mission;

(b) Persistent disruption of worship services or community gatherings;

(c) Violation of the confidentiality of pastoral conversations after warning;

(d) Criminal conduct that creates a safety concern for the congregation.

Termination of membership requires the written approval of the Senior Pastor after pastoral conversation with the member. The member may appeal to the Spiritual Council within thirty (30) days.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Legal enforceability disclaimer:** Confirm that the disclaimer language (spiritual commitment, not a legal contract) is sufficient to prevent any claim that this Covenant creates enforceable obligations — particularly regarding the Church's commitments in Part III.
2. **Involuntary termination process:** Is the process outlined in Section 8 sufficient, or should additional due process protections be included to protect the Church from claims of religious discrimination or breach of implied contract?
3. **Confidentiality provision scope:** Does the member's confidentiality affirmation in Section 3(d) create any enforceable duty? Should the Covenant explicitly disclaim legal enforceability of this specific provision?
4. **State-specific membership requirements:** Do any states impose specific requirements for church membership governance (e.g., member voting rights) that could conflict with the no-voting-rights provision?
5. **Digital membership:** As the Church grows its digital ministry, can members sign this Covenant electronically? Does electronic signature affect the spiritual or legal character of the document?
