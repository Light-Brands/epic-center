## Preamble

Cook Islands International Business Companies operate through nominee directors — this is a feature of the jurisdiction, not a deficiency. But the Church of the Living Light does not entrust its sacred interests to nominees without covenant. Where the law provides a board of directors composed of nominees, covenant provides an Advisory Board composed of the people who are actually responsible for what happens.

This Advisory Board Agreement is the Church's governance instrument for LBC. It provides the same rights — the same seat at the table, the same veto, the same information, the same voice — as a formal board seat would in any other jurisdiction. The mechanism is contractual rather than statutory. The power is identical.

The Church does not accept economic participation without governance participation. To receive 30% of the profits without a voice in how those profits are generated would be to accept a role that contradicts everything the Church stands for. Stewardship is not passive. The Advisory Board is where stewardship becomes action.

## 2. Recitals

WHEREAS, the Church holds a 30% Profit Participation Agreement with respect to LBC (the "PPA"), as set forth in D04;

WHEREAS, LBC is a Cook Islands International Business Company that uses nominee directors as required by the jurisdictional structure, and therefore governance by PPA holders is exercised through an Advisory Board rather than through statutory board membership;

WHEREAS, Principle 13 of the Governing Framework requires that the Church hold governance rights commensurate with its economic interest, including a board-equivalent seat and veto rights;

WHEREAS, Principle 14 of the Governing Framework requires that the Church receive most-favored-nation protection on all governance rights;

WHEREAS, the parties wish to establish an Advisory Board with contractual governance authority equivalent to a formal board seat, ensuring the Church's governance rights are not diminished by the jurisdictional requirement for nominee directors;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

---

## 3. Establishment of Advisory Board

### 3.1 Creation

The parties hereby establish an Advisory Board for LBC (the "Advisory Board"). The Advisory Board is a contractual governance body, not a statutory organ of LBC. Its authority derives from this Agreement and the mutual consent of all parties, not from the Cook Islands International Companies Act.

### 3.2 Binding Authority

Notwithstanding the contractual nature of the Advisory Board, the parties agree that the Advisory Board's decisions, recommendations, and veto rights shall be binding upon all parties and upon the nominee directors of LBC. The nominee directors of LBC shall not take any action that contravenes a decision or veto of the Advisory Board. S.A. and PIF shall instruct the nominee directors accordingly.

### 3.3 Equivalence to Board Seat

The Advisory Board seat held by the Church under this Agreement shall provide the Church with governance power equivalent to a formal board seat on a statutory board of directors. Any reference in the Governing Framework, the PPA, or any other agreement to a "board seat" for the Church with respect to LBC shall be deemed to refer to the Advisory Board seat established under this Agreement.

---

## 4. Church Advisory Board Seat

### 4.1 Appointment

The Church shall hold one (1) seat on the Advisory Board (the "Church Seat"). The Church's advisory board representative (the "Church Representative") shall be appointed by the Spiritual Council of the Church of the Living Light.

### 4.2 Appointment Process

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Nomination** | The Senior Pastor of the Church nominates a candidate for the Church Seat |
| **Confirmation** | The Spiritual Council confirms the nomination by majority vote |
| **Notification** | The Church provides written notice to LBC and S.A. of the appointment within fifteen (15) days |
| **Effective date** | The appointment is effective upon written notice |

### 4.3 Term and Replacement

The Church Representative serves at the pleasure of the Spiritual Council. The Church may replace its representative at any time by providing written notice. No approval of LBC, S.A., PIF, or the nominee directors is required for the Church to appoint or replace its representative.

### 4.4 Governance Pause Provision

During any Governance Pause as defined in the Church Bylaws (Article IIB), the Church Seat shall be held by Jennifer Lawless (Acting Senior Pastor) or her designee. This transition is automatic upon invocation of a Governance Pause and does not require approval from LBC, S.A., PIF, or the nominee directors. The Acting Senior Pastor exercises the full authority of the Church Representative for the duration of the pause.

---

## 6. Veto Rights

### 6.1 Church Consent Required

The following actions require the prior written consent of the Church (acting through its Church Representative or directly through the Spiritual Council). Neither LBC, S.A., PIF, nor the nominee directors shall take or authorize any of the following without the Church's consent:

| Action Requiring Church Consent | Rationale |
|--------------------------------|-----------|
| **Sale, merger, or consolidation** of LBC or substantially all of its assets | Protects the Church's 30% exit participation and ensures the Church is not forced into a transaction without its agreement |
| **New debt** above $[________] (threshold to be set) | Prevents debt that could subordinate the Church's PPA distributions or impair LBC's ability to pay |
| **Related-party transactions** between LBC and any director, officer, PPA holder, S.A., PIF, or their affiliates | Prevents self-dealing that could divert value away from PPA holders |
| **New PPA issuance** or creation of new economic interests | Protects the Church from dilution of its 30% participation |
| **Material change of business** — any change in LBC's core business activities that would fundamentally alter its operations or revenue model | Ensures the Church's PPA remains tied to the business it agreed to participate in |
| **Executive compensation** above $[________] per individual per year (threshold to be set) | Prevents excessive compensation that could reduce Distributable Profits |

### 6.2 Veto Process

| Step | Detail |

| **Information** | The notice shall include all material information necessary for the Church to evaluate the proposed action |
| **Deliberation** | The Church Representative may consult with the Spiritual Council before responding |
| **Response** | The Church shall respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days of receiving the notice. Failure to respond within this period shall be deemed a withholding of consent. |
| **Good faith** | The Church shall exercise its veto rights in good faith, consistent with its fiduciary duties as a PPA holder and its sacred mission |

### 6.3 Nominee Director Compliance

S.A. and PIF shall instruct the nominee directors of LBC not to execute, authorize, or implement any action listed in Section 6.1 without first obtaining written confirmation that the Church has provided its consent. Any action taken by nominee directors without the Church's required consent shall be voidable at the Church's election.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Cook Islands IBC governance:** Under the Cook Islands International Companies Act, can an IBC create a contractual advisory board with binding governance authority? Or are nominee directors the only legally recognized governance body? If the Advisory Board is purely contractual, how is it enforced — as a breach of contract between the parties?

2. **Nominee director compliance:** What mechanism compels nominee directors to follow Advisory Board decisions? Can S.A. (as sole shareholder) give irrevocable instructions to nominees? Should the nominee director engagement agreements contain explicit language subordinating their authority to the Advisory Board?

3. **Voidable actions:** Section 6.3 states that actions taken without Church consent are voidable at the Church's election. Is this enforceable against third parties who rely on actions authorized by nominee directors? Should the Agreement include a notice mechanism to put third parties on notice of the veto requirements?

4. **Threshold amounts:** Counsel to recommend specific dollar thresholds for the debt ceiling and executive compensation veto triggers based on LBC's projected operations and revenue.

5. **Governance Pause interaction:** During a Governance Pause, Jennifer Lawless (or her designee) represents the Church on the Advisory Board. Should the nominee director engagement agreements be amended to acknowledge this automatic succession mechanism?

6. **Enforceability of contractual governance:** In Cook Islands courts, does a contractual governance arrangement carry the same weight as statutory governance? Are there precedents for advisory boards with binding authority in the Cook Islands?

7. **Interaction with D04 PPA:** This Agreement supplements D04 (PPA for LBC). Should it be incorporated by reference into D04, or remain independent? Which approach gives stronger enforcement?

8. **MFN retroactivity:** If LBC grants improved governance rights to another PPA holder and fails to notify the Church within 30 days, can the retroactive amendment mechanism be enforced in Cook Islands courts?
