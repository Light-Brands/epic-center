## Preamble

Stewardship is not a financial concept dressed in spiritual language. It is a divine ethic. Every dollar that flows through the Church of the Living Light carries a sacred obligation — to be received with integrity, deployed with purpose, and accounted for with transparency. The seventh generation will inherit not only our ministry but our financial discipline.

This document establishes the audit procedures that protect the Church from external challenge and internal drift. The Church Audit Procedures Act (IRC 7611) grants churches extraordinary protections from IRS examination — protections no other tax-exempt organization receives. These protections exist because the First Amendment demands it. But protection without internal discipline is a house built on sand. The Church earns the right to its protections by maintaining standards that exceed what the law requires.

These procedures are the Church's covenant with itself: that every transaction will be documented, every account will be reconciled, every expenditure will serve the mission, and every question will have an answer already prepared.

## PART I — CHURCH AUDIT PROCEDURES ACT (IRC 7611) PROTECTIONS

### Section 1. Heightened IRS Examination Standards

The Church of the Living Light, as a 508(c)(1)(A) church, is protected by the **Church Audit Procedures Act** (IRC 7611), which imposes the following restrictions on IRS examinations of churches:

| Protection | Detail | IRC Reference |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Treasury-level approval required** | No church tax inquiry may be initiated without the reasonable written approval of a **Regional Commissioner or higher-level Treasury Department official**. A revenue agent cannot unilaterally open a church examination. | IRC 7611(a)(2) |
| **Written notice to church** | Before beginning any inquiry, the IRS must provide the church with **written notice** stating: (a) the concerns that gave rise to the inquiry, (b) the general subject matter of the inquiry, and (c) the applicable provisions of law. | IRC 7611(a)(3)(A) |
| **Church tax inquiry vs. church tax examination** | The IRS must first conduct a **church tax inquiry** (limited in scope — generally document requests and interviews) before escalating to a **church tax examination** (full audit). The inquiry must precede the examination by at least 15 days. | IRC 7611(a)(1), (b)(1) |
| **90-day conference period** | The church has the right to a **conference** with the IRS before the examination begins. The IRS must offer this conference in its written notice. The church has 90 days from the date of notice to request a conference. | IRC 7611(b)(3) |
| **2-year time limit** | A church tax examination must be **completed within two (2) years** from the date of the examination notice. The IRS cannot extend this period except in cases involving: (a) a mutual agreement between the church and the IRS, (b) a court order, or (c) criminal investigation. | IRC 7611(c)(1) |
| **5-year cooldown between examinations** | The IRS may not begin a new church tax inquiry or examination if one was **completed within the preceding five (5) years**, unless the Secretary has evidence of criminal activity or a knowing failure to file a required return. | IRC 7611(h) |
| **Limitations on scope** | The IRS may only examine church records that are **relevant to the specific concern** stated in the written notice. The IRS may not conduct a general fishing expedition through church records. | IRC 7611(b)(1)(B) |
| **No Form 990 required** | Churches are specifically exempt from Form 990 filing requirements (IRC 6033(a)(3)(A)(i)). The IRS has no annual financial disclosure to trigger an inquiry. The Church's financial information remains private unless an examination is initiated under IRC 7611. | IRC 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) |

### Section 2. What Triggers a Church Tax Inquiry

The IRS may initiate a church tax inquiry only if the appropriate Treasury official **reasonably believes** (based on facts and circumstances) that the church:

(a) May not qualify for tax exemption under IRC 501(a);

(b) May be carrying on an unrelated trade or business (UBIT) under IRC 513;

(c) May otherwise be engaged in activities subject to tax.

The IRS may **not** initiate an inquiry based on:

(a) The church's theological beliefs or doctrinal positions;

(b) The church's governance structure (unless the structure itself suggests non-exempt purpose);

(c) Media reports, anonymous tips, or disgruntled former members — unless corroborated by specific facts known to the IRS.

### Section 3. The Church's Advantage

The combination of these protections means that:

(a) The IRS cannot casually audit the Church — it requires senior Treasury approval;

(b) The Church receives advance written notice and the right to a conference before any examination;

(c) The Church has a 2-year time limit on any examination — the IRS cannot conduct an indefinite investigation;

(d) After one examination, the Church has a 5-year cooldown — the IRS cannot return for half a decade;

(e) The Church files no Form 990 — there is no annual public disclosure that could trigger an inquiry;

(f) The Church's financial privacy is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.

**These protections are the strongest in the Internal Revenue Code. No other exempt organization receives them. The Church honors these protections by maintaining internal discipline that makes external examination unnecessary.**

## PART V — IRS CHURCH TAX INQUIRY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### Section 14. Immediate Actions Upon Receipt of IRS Notice

If the Church receives written notice of a church tax inquiry under IRC 7611:

**Step 1 — Do not respond immediately.** The Church has rights. Exercise them.

**Step 2 — Notify the following persons within 24 hours:**
- Senior Pastor (Daniel Lawless)
- Treasurer (Timothy Lawless)
- Secretary (Nancy Courchesne)
- Church counsel (religious nonprofit attorney)

**Step 3 — Review the notice with counsel.** Confirm that the notice satisfies all IRC 7611 requirements:
- Signed by a Regional Commissioner or higher-level Treasury official;
- States the specific concerns giving rise to the inquiry;
- States the general subject matter;
- States the applicable provisions of law;
- Offers the Church a conference.

**Step 4 — If the notice is defective,** counsel should file a written objection identifying the deficiencies. A defective notice may invalidate the inquiry.

**Step 5 — Exercise the right to a conference.** The Church should request the 90-day conference period. Use this time to prepare, organize records, and develop the response strategy with counsel.

**Step 6 — Assemble the record.** Gather all documents responsive to the stated scope of the inquiry. Do not provide documents outside the stated scope — the IRS is limited to what it identified in the notice.

**Step 7 — Respond through counsel.** All communications with the IRS should be through the Church's attorney. Do not allow direct contact between IRS agents and Church staff without counsel present.

**Step 8 — Monitor the 2-year clock.** The examination must be completed within two years. Track the start date carefully.

**Step 9 — Document everything.** Every communication, every document produced, every meeting — document it all.

### Section 15. Post-Examination Procedures

(a) If the examination results in **no change**, file a copy of the closing letter in the Church's permanent records. Note the completion date for the 5-year cooldown calculation.

(b) If the examination results in **proposed changes**, engage counsel immediately. The Church has the right to contest any proposed assessment through administrative appeal and, if necessary, through the United States Tax Court.

(c) After any examination, the Finance Committee shall conduct a **post-examination review** to identify any internal procedures that should be strengthened. Lessons learned shall be documented and incorporated into these procedures.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Voluntary audit in Year 1:** Should the Church engage an independent auditor from Year 1 (even though revenue will be well below $500K) to strengthen the defense narrative? A clean audit report from Year 1 demonstrates good faith and financial discipline.
2. **Record retention period:** The 7-year minimum aligns with the general federal statute of limitations. Should any records be retained longer given the state of incorporation's requirements or the perpetual nature of PPA agreements?
3. **IRC 7611 compliance checklist:** Should counsel prepare a detailed IRC 7611 compliance checklist that can be immediately deployed upon receipt of an IRS notice?
4. **PPA audit rights:** Confirm that the Church's exercise of audit rights under the PPAs (to verify distribution calculations) is properly documented and that audit results are retained as part of the Church's financial records.
5. **FATCA and international reporting:** Does the Church have any FATCA or FBAR obligations arising from receipt of international wire transfers (PPA distributions from UAE and Cook Islands)? If so, should compliance procedures be added to this document?
6. **Ministry use documentation standard:** What level of detail is required in ministry use logs to sustain the tax-free treatment of church-owned assets? Is a monthly summary sufficient, or must each use be individually documented?
