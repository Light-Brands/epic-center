## Conditional Execution Notice

**THIS AGREEMENT IS CONDITIONAL.** It shall be executed only if Jason Sparks elects **Option C or Option D** from the founder compensation options set forth in [03-FOUNDER-GUIDE-US.md](../03-FOUNDER-GUIDE-US.md), Part II. If Jason elects Option A or Option B (retaining PPAs personally), this document is not executed and has no force or effect.

If executed, the Church of the Living Light will hold a combined **40% PPA interest** in both LBS and LBC:

| Daniel Lawless | 30% | 30% | [D01](./D01-PPA-ASSIGNMENT-DANIEL-TO-CHURCH.md) |
| Jason Sparks | 10% | 10% | This document (D02) |
| **Church Total** | **40%** | **40%** | |

---

## Preamble

Every agreement the Church of the Living Light enters is an act of sacred exchange. The Ethic of Reciprocity governs not only the agreements themselves but the decision to enter them. Jason's choice to assign his PPA interests to the Church is a voluntary act of alignment with the Church's sacred mission. It is not compelled. It is chosen. And in the choosing, it becomes sacred.

The 14 Bulletproof Principles that govern the underlying PPAs are the Ethic of Reciprocity and the moral of "Never Betray" made legal. These principles protect the Church's interests with the same force whether the Church holds 30% or 40%. Every attack vector is closed. Every right is protected. Every promise is enforceable.

Irrevocability, once chosen, admits no reversal. This assignment, like the one before it, is a declaration: the Church is the owner, and the gift is complete.

---

## 1. Condition Precedent

### 1.1 Written Election Required

This Assignment Agreement shall not become effective unless and until the Assignor has delivered to the Church a signed, written election of **Option C or Option D** as described in the founder compensation framework. The election must:

(a) Be in writing, signed by the Assignor;

(b) Identify the specific option elected (C or D);

(c) Be delivered to the Chairman of the Spiritual Council;

(d) Be filed with the Church Secretary as a permanent record.

### 1.2 Ordination Requirement

Prior to or concurrent with execution of this Assignment Agreement, the Assignor must have completed the Church's ordination program and been ordained as **Associate Pastor** of the Church of the Living Light, as set forth in [E01 Ordination Program Curriculum](./E01-ORDINATION-PROGRAM-CURRICULUM.md). Ordination requires:

(a) Completion of all required coursework and ministry training;

(b) Affirmation of the Statement of Faith ([A03](./A03-STATEMENT-OF-FAITH.md));

(c) Recommendation by the Senior Pastor;

(d) Confirmation by majority vote of the Spiritual Council.

### 1.3 No Effect Without Conditions

If either condition precedent (written election and ordination) is not satisfied, this Assignment Agreement is void and without effect. The Assignor retains all rights under his PPAs as if this document had never been drafted.

---

## 4. Assignment

### 4.1 Irrevocable Assignment

The Assignor hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, conveys, and delivers to the Assignee, without reservation, condition, or limitation, 100% of the Assignor's right, title, and interest in and to the Assigned PPAs, including without limitation:

(a) **Profit distributions** — all quarterly profit distributions under both the LBS PPA and the LBC PPA, calculated per the 14 Bulletproof Principles;

(b) **Exit participation** — all rights to participate in exit proceeds upon sale, merger, consolidation, IPO, liquidation, or wind-down of LBS or LBC;

(c) **Governance rights** — all observer rights, consent rights, and voting rights granted under the Assigned PPAs;

(d) **Accumulation account** — all accrued and future balances in the accumulation accounts maintained under each PPA;

(e) **Anti-dilution rights** — all pre-emptive rights, anti-dilution protections, and consent rights regarding new equity or PPA issuances;

(f) **Audit and information rights** — all rights to receive financial statements, conduct audits, and access books and records of LBS and LBC;

(g) **Specific performance and enforcement** — all rights to seek specific performance, injunctive relief, acceleration, and damages under the Assigned PPAs;

(h) **Most-favored-nation rights** — all rights to receive improved terms granted to any other PPA holder;

(i) **All ancillary rights** — every other right, benefit, privilege, or interest arising under, connected to, or derived from the Assigned PPAs, whether now existing or hereafter arising.

### 4.2 Completeness

The assignment is total and complete. No right, benefit, privilege, or interest under the Assigned PPAs is retained by the Assignor. From the Effective Date forward, the Church stands in the Assignor's place for all purposes under both PPAs.

---

## 5. Irrevocability

### 5.1 Permanent and Unconditional

This assignment is **irrevocable**. The Assignor permanently and unconditionally waives all right to:

(a) Reclaim any portion of the Assigned PPAs;

(b) Modify, alter, or redirect any distribution, right, or interest under the Assigned PPAs;

(c) Revoke, rescind, or cancel this Assignment Agreement;

(d) Assert any claim, lien, or interest in the Assigned PPAs after the Effective Date;

(e) Instruct LBS, LBC, S.A., or PIF to pay any distribution or exit proceeds to anyone other than the Church.

### 5.2 No Condition Subsequent

No event, circumstance, or change in condition shall cause this assignment to lapse, terminate, or revert. The Assignor cannot create a condition subsequent by any act or omission. The conditions in Section 1 are conditions precedent to execution only; once executed, the assignment is unconditional.

### 5.3 Assignment of Income Doctrine Defense

The irrevocability of this assignment is specifically designed to defeat any challenge under the assignment of income doctrine (Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111 (1930)). Because the Assignor retains zero economic interest, zero governance rights, and zero ability to redirect distributions, the Assignor does not "own" the income for federal tax purposes. The Church is the economic owner from the Effective Date forward.

---

## 6. No Retained Interest

### 6.1 Zero Interest

After the Effective Date, the Assignor retains **zero** economic or governance interest in the Assigned PPAs, LBS, or LBC. Specifically:

(a) The Assignor has no right to receive any distribution from LBS or LBC;

(b) The Assignor has no right to participate in any exit event;

(c) The Assignor has no right to any accumulation account balance;

(d) The Assignor has no right to exercise any governance, observer, or consent right under the Assigned PPAs;

(e) The Assignor has no right to access the books, records, or financial statements of LBS or LBC through the Assigned PPAs.

### 6.2 Church as Holder

From the Effective Date, the Church is the sole and exclusive holder of the Assigned PPAs and exercises all rights thereunder through its Spiritual Council or its designees. Combined with the assignment from Daniel Lawless (D01), the Church holds 40% of the economic interest in both LBS and LBC.

---

## 7. Consideration

### 7.1 Nature of Transfer

This assignment is made as an irrevocable gift and donation from the Assignor to the Church, a tax-exempt organization under IRC 508(c)(1)(A).

### 7.2 Charitable Deduction

Whether the Assignor may claim a charitable contribution deduction for this gift, and the valuation of such deduction, shall be determined by counsel. The Assignor acknowledges that the availability and amount of any deduction depends on the fair market value of the Assigned PPAs at the date of transfer and applicable IRS rules regarding gifts of partial interests and future income streams. Counsel to advise on Form 8283, qualified appraisal requirements, and gift tax implications.

### 7.3 No Quid Pro Quo

The assignment is not conditioned on the Assignor receiving any specific compensation, benefit, or consideration from the Church. The Assignor's compensation as Associate Pastor is determined independently by the Compensation Committee under the rebuttable presumption process (26 CFR 53.4958-6) and bears no contractual relationship to the distributions received by the Church under the Assigned PPAs.

---

## 8. Entity Consent

### 8.1 Consent and Acknowledgment

Each of LBS, LBC, S.A., and PIF hereby:

(a) **Consents** to the irrevocable assignment of the Assigned PPAs from the Assignor to the Church;

(b) **Acknowledges** the Church as the holder of the Assigned PPAs from the Effective Date;

(c) **Agrees** to pay all distributions, exit proceeds, accumulation account balances, and any other amounts due under the Assigned PPAs directly to the Church's designated PPA Distribution Account;

(e) **Agrees** to provide all financial statements, audit access, and information rights directly to the Church;

(f) **Waives** any right to refuse recognition of the Church as the PPA holder based on the identity of the original grantee.

### 8.2 No Offset

No entity may offset, deduct, or reduce any amount owed to the Church under the Assigned PPAs based on any claim against the Assignor personally.

---

## 9. Effective Date

(a) All distributions accruing under the Assigned PPAs are the property of the Church;

(b) All governance rights under the Assigned PPAs are exercisable by the Church;

(c) The Assignor has no further rights or obligations under the Assigned PPAs, except as set forth in this Agreement.

---

## 10. Survival

### 10.1 Survival Events

This assignment survives each of the following events without any effect on its validity, enforceability, or scope:

(a) **Death of the Assignor** — the Church retains the Assigned PPAs in perpetuity;

(c) **Departure of the Assignor from the Church** — voluntary resignation, removal for cause, or any other cessation of the Assignor's service as Associate Pastor;

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Conditional assignment enforceability:** Is a conditional assignment (conditions precedent to execution) enforceable in the same manner as an unconditional assignment? Once executed, the conditions have been satisfied and the assignment is irrevocable. Counsel to confirm that the conditional structure does not create an argument that the assignment is revocable or contingent.

2. **Ordination as condition precedent:** Does requiring ordination before assignment create any tax or legal issues? Could the IRS argue that the assignment is "compensation" for agreeing to be ordained, rather than a charitable gift? Counsel to advise on framing.

3. **Gift tax on assignment:** Same analysis as D01 — what is the fair market value of the 10% PPAs at the date of transfer? Gift tax may apply. Counsel to advise on Form 709 filing requirements.

4. **Assignment of income doctrine:** Same analysis as D01 — irrevocability and completeness are designed to defeat this challenge. The fact that Jason elected to assign (rather than being compelled) may strengthen the defense. Counsel to confirm.

5. **40% combined Church interest:** With Daniel's 30% and Jason's 10%, the Church holds 40% of both entities. Does this combined holding trigger any additional governance rights, consent thresholds, or regulatory implications in the UAE, Cook Islands, or Panama? Does the Church become a "significant interest holder" in any jurisdiction?

6. **Associate Pastor compensation:** Jason's compensation as Associate Pastor must be independently determined by the Compensation Committee using comparables, with no reference to the value of the assigned PPAs. Counsel to confirm that the rebuttable presumption process (26 CFR 53.4958-6) covers Associate Pastors and not just the Senior Pastor.

7. **Option C vs. Option D delta:** If Jason elects Option D (TE equity + church PPAs), he retains personal equity in TE entities while assigning the PPAs. Counsel to confirm there is no interaction between the personal equity and the assigned PPAs that could compromise the irrevocability or create an assignment of income issue.

8. **Multi-jurisdiction enforcement:** Same multi-jurisdiction analysis as D01 — US, UAE, Cook Islands, Panama. Counsel to confirm enforceability across all four jurisdictions.
