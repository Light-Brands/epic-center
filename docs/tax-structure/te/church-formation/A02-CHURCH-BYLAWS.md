# ARTICLE II — SENIOR PASTOR

## Section 1. Appointment

**Daniel Lawless** is the founding Senior Pastor of the Church of the Living Light. The Senior Pastor serves as Chairman of the Spiritual Council and chief spiritual officer of the Church.

## Section 2. Tenure

The Senior Pastor shall serve for life or until voluntary resignation. The Senior Pastor's tenure is not subject to term limits, periodic reconfirmation, or mandatory retirement.

## Section 3. Removal

The Senior Pastor may be removed only by **unanimous vote of all Spiritual Council members** (excluding the Senior Pastor from the vote) upon a documented finding of one or more of the following:

(a) **Felony conviction** in a court of law, after exhaustion of all appeals;

(b) **Proven moral turpitude** as determined by the Spiritual Council, defined as conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that is materially harmful to the Church's mission and reputation;

(c) **Permanent physical or mental incapacity** certified by two (2) licensed physicians, rendering the Senior Pastor unable to perform the essential duties of the office for a period exceeding twelve (12) consecutive months.

No other grounds shall constitute cause for the Senior Pastor's removal. Disagreement with the Senior Pastor's doctrinal decisions, theological positions, ministry direction, or governance votes shall not constitute grounds for removal.

## Section 4. Doctrinal Authority

The Senior Pastor is the sole and final authority on all matters of doctrine, theology, spiritual direction, ministry vision, and the interpretation of the Statement of Faith. No Spiritual Council resolution, committee decision, or congregational vote may override the Senior Pastor's doctrinal determinations.

The Senior Pastor's doctrinal authority extends to all ministry programs, content, partnerships, activities, and operations of the Church insofar as they relate to the Church's spiritual mission.

The Senior Pastor shall consult with the Co-Founder on matters of worship, community ministry, and congregational care before issuing doctrinal determinations in those areas. This consultation is advisory — the Senior Pastor retains final doctrinal authority. This consultation requirement may not be waived or eliminated without the Co-Founder's written consent.

## Section 5. Board Nomination Power

All nominations to the Spiritual Council shall originate from the Nominations Committee, which is chaired by the Senior Pastor. No person may be appointed to the Spiritual Council without the Senior Pastor's affirmative nomination. The Senior Pastor may veto any proposed appointment.

## Section 6. Budget Authority

The Senior Pastor shall propose the annual ministry budget to the Spiritual Council for approval. The Senior Pastor is authorized to approve expenditures up to **$[50,000]** per transaction without prior Council approval, provided such expenditures are within the approved annual budget and consistent with the Church's ministry mission.

## Section 7. Succession

The Senior Pastor shall have the right to designate a successor Senior Pastor by written instrument filed with the Spiritual Council. Upon the Senior Pastor's death, voluntary resignation, or permanent incapacity (as defined in Section 3(c)), the designated successor shall assume the role of Senior Pastor, subject to ratification by majority vote of the Spiritual Council.

If no designation exists or the designated successor is unable or unwilling to serve, the Spiritual Council shall select a successor Senior Pastor by two-thirds (2/3) vote from among the Church's ordained ministers.

## Section 8. Amendment Lock

No provision of this Article II may be amended, modified, or repealed without the prior written consent of the Senior Pastor. This Section 8 protects itself — it may not be amended without the Senior Pastor's written consent.

---

# ARTICLE IIA — CO-FOUNDER PROTECTIONS

## Section 1. Recognition

**Jennifer Lawless** is recognized as **Co-Founder** of the Church of the Living Light. Her contributions to the founding and establishment of the Church are foundational and permanent. The protections set forth in this Article are irrevocable except as expressly provided herein.

## Section 2. Life Tenure on the Spiritual Council

The Co-Founder shall serve on the Spiritual Council for life or until voluntary resignation. The Co-Founder's tenure is not subject to term limits, periodic reconfirmation, or mandatory retirement.

The Co-Founder may be removed only by **unanimous vote of all Spiritual Council members** (excluding the Co-Founder from the vote) upon a documented finding of one or more of the following:

(a) Felony conviction in a court of law, after exhaustion of all appeals;

(b) Proven moral turpitude as determined by the Spiritual Council;

(c) Permanent physical or mental incapacity certified by two (2) licensed physicians.

The standard for removal of the Co-Founder is identical to the standard for removal of the Senior Pastor.

## Section 3. Protected Role

The Co-Founder shall serve as **Director of Worship & Community Life**. This role encompasses leadership of worship services, congregational pastoral care, community outreach coordination, women's ministry, small group ministry, and community events.

This role, its title, scope, and ministry responsibilities may not be altered, diminished, merged, eliminated, or reassigned without the Co-Founder's prior written consent.

## Section 4. Acting Senior Pastor Designation

In the event of a Governance Pause (Article IIB), the Co-Founder shall serve as **Acting Senior Pastor** for the duration of the pause. This designation is structural and automatic — it does not require a Council vote upon invocation of a pause.

The Acting Senior Pastor exercises the operational authority of the Senior Pastor as set forth in Article IIB, Section 3, but does not acquire the Senior Pastor's structural protections under this Article II.

This designation survives any change in the marital status of the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder.

## Section 5. Governance Pause Trigger Authority

The Co-Founder may invoke a Governance Pause by filing a written Concern with the Spiritual Council, as set forth in Article IIB. The pause takes effect upon the concurrence of two (2) independent Council members.

This trigger authority survives any change in the marital status of the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder.

## Section 6. Compensation Protection

The Co-Founder's compensation, once established by the Compensation Committee, shall not be reduced, suspended, or terminated:

(a) Based on any change in the marital status of the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder;

(b) As retaliation for the Co-Founder's exercise of any right under this Article IIA, including triggering a Governance Pause;

(c) As retaliation for the Co-Founder's vote on any Council matter.

The Compensation Committee shall review the Co-Founder's compensation on the same annual basis as all other staff, based on her role and Church revenue, without regard to her marital status.

## Section 7. Nominations Committee Seat

The Co-Founder holds a permanent seat on the Nominations Committee. This seat may not be removed or reassigned without the Co-Founder's written consent.

## Section 8. Separation Clause

In the event that the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder are no longer married, **all** governance provisions, Council seats, protected roles, authority, compensation, and structural protections of each shall continue unaltered. Specifically:

(a) The Co-Founder's life tenure on the Spiritual Council shall continue;

(b) The Co-Founder's role as Director of Worship & Community Life shall continue;

(c) The Co-Founder's compensation shall continue, reviewed annually based on role and Church revenue;

(d) The Co-Founder's Acting Senior Pastor designation shall continue;

(e) The Co-Founder's Governance Pause trigger authority shall continue;

(f) The Co-Founder's Nominations Committee seat shall continue;

(g) The Co-Founder's amendment lock under Section 9 shall continue;

(h) Neither party may invoke the other's removal based on change in marital status;

(i) The Co-Founder may vote on the Senior Pastor's compensation if the Co-Founder and Senior Pastor no longer share a household (the prior recusal was based on shared household benefit, not the relationship itself);

(j) The marriage exception under Article III, Section 7 (Relationship Prohibition) terminates — both are subject to the same prohibition with respect to other Council members;

(k) The New Spouse Veto under Article III, Section 8 becomes operative — both Co-Founders must consent to the other's new partner joining the Council.

This provision may not be amended without the written consent of **both** the Senior Pastor **and** the Co-Founder.

## Section 9. Amendment Lock

No provision of this Article IIA may be amended, modified, or repealed without the prior written consent of the Co-Founder (Jennifer Lawless). This Section 9 protects itself — it may not be amended without the Co-Founder's written consent.

---

# ARTICLE IIB — GOVERNANCE PAUSE (CIRCUIT BREAKER)

- Lead or delegate worship services
- Represent the Church on the LBS board seat and LBC advisory board
- Bring a motion to the Council for the Senior Pastor's return (after the minimum period)

(b) The Senior Pastor **retains** all structural protections:
- Title of Senior Pastor
- Life tenure
- Doctrinal authority (dormant during pause — may not exercise)
- Board nomination power (dormant during pause)
- Amendment lock (active — cannot be circumvented during pause)
- Succession designation rights

- Designate a successor Senior Pastor

## Section 5. Return

(a) After the minimum thirty (30) day period has elapsed, the Senior Pastor may request return to full authority.

(b) The Spiritual Council votes on the Senior Pastor's return. The vote requires a **majority of the full Council (4 of 7)**. The Senior Pastor does not vote on the Senior Pastor's own return.

(c) If the Council denies return, the next review occurs thirty (30) days later. This cycle repeats until either (i) the Council approves return, or (ii) the 180-day maximum is reached.

(d) At Day 180, the Senior Pastor automatically returns to full authority regardless of any pending or denied vote.

## Section 6. Post-Return Cooling Off Period

(a) May not initiate removal proceedings against any Council member, except for criminal conduct or breach of fiduciary duty;

(b) May not propose amendments to these Bylaws;

(c) May not reorganize committee assignments or remove any member from any committee.

## Section 7. Reciprocal Pause

The same Governance Pause mechanism applies to the Co-Founder's operational authority. If the Council votes (5 of 6, excluding the Co-Founder) to invoke a pause on the Co-Founder:

(a) The Co-Founder steps back from the Director of Worship & Community Life operational duties;

(b) The Senior Pastor or another Council member assumes the Co-Founder's operational responsibilities temporarily;

(c) The same 30-180 day window applies;

(d) The same 1-year cooling off period applies to the Council's relationship with the Co-Founder;

(e) The Co-Founder retains all structural protections (life tenure, amendment lock, Council seat).

## Section 8. Fallback

If the Acting Senior Pastor (Co-Founder) is unable or unwilling to serve during a Governance Pause, the Spiritual Council shall elect an Acting Chair from among its remaining members by majority vote. The Compensation Committee Chair shall serve as interim Acting Chair until the Council elects.

## Section 9. Amendment Lock

No provision of this Article IIB may be amended, modified, or repealed without the prior written consent of the Senior Pastor. This Section 9 protects itself.

- **Sydney Griffith** — Chair
- **Iryna Voitenko** — Member
- **Angelina Adelaide** — Member

## Section 2. Independence Requirements

Each Compensation Committee member must satisfy **all** of the following:

(a) Not a family member of the Senior Pastor (spouse, sibling, child, parent, or their spouses) as defined in IRC 4958;

(b) Not an employee of the Church (Council service is voluntary or nominal stipend only);

(c) Not a business partner or financial counterparty of the Senior Pastor;

(d) Not receiving compensation from any entity in the Light Brands or Transformational Epicenter organizational structure;

(e) No financial interest that would be affected by any person's compensation determination.

## Section 3. Authority

The Compensation Committee has **sole authority** to determine compensation for all Church staff, including:

(a) Senior Pastor;
(b) Co-Founder / Director of Worship & Community Life;
(c) Associate Pastor (if applicable);
(d) All other compensated Church staff and Council members;
(e) Housing allowance designations under IRC 107;
(f) Retirement plan contributions;
(g) Church-owned asset acquisitions for minister use.

## Section 4. Process — Rebuttable Presumption (26 CFR 53.4958-6)

For every compensation determination, the Committee shall follow this process:

**Step 1 — Comparable Data:** Obtain compensation data from comparable organizations — churches of similar size, revenue, mission, and scope. Data sources include but are not limited to: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Lakewood Church, NACBA salary surveys, ECFA compensation benchmarks, ERI Nonprofit Compensation Database.

**Step 2 — Exclusion of Affected Person:** The person whose compensation is being determined must leave the room and may not be present during deliberation or voting. The Senior Pastor recuses from votes on the Senior Pastor's own compensation.

**Step 3 — Independent Deliberation:** The Committee reviews comparable data, discusses total package value (salary + housing + retirement + church-owned assets), and considers Church revenue, size, and the scope of the minister's role.

**Step 4 — Majority Vote:** The Committee approves the compensation package by majority vote (2 of 3).

**Step 5 — Documentation:** The Committee prepares a written resolution stating: (a) the compensation amount and components, (b) the comparable data relied upon, (c) the rationale for the determination, and (d) who was present and who was excluded.

**Step 6 — Filing:** The written resolution and meeting minutes are filed with the Church Secretary within sixty (60) days of the determination.

**If this process is followed, there is a rebuttable presumption under 26 CFR 53.4958-6 that the compensation is reasonable.** The burden shifts to the IRS to prove otherwise.

## Section 5. Annual Review

The Compensation Committee shall review all compensation packages annually before the start of each fiscal year. Housing allowance designations must be made **prospectively** — before the tax year to which they apply.

## Section 6. Recusal

(a) The Senior Pastor recuses from all votes on the Senior Pastor's compensation.

(b) The Co-Founder recuses from votes on the Senior Pastor's compensation while the Senior Pastor and Co-Founder share a household. If they no longer share a household, the Co-Founder may vote.

(c) Each Committee member recuses from votes on the Committee member's own compensation. The remaining two members determine the recused member's compensation.

(d) Timothy Lawless is a "disqualified person" under IRC 4958 (sibling) and does **not** sit on the Compensation Committee. Timothy votes on general Council matters only.

(e) Nancy Courchesne is a "disqualified person" under IRC 4958 (spousal attribution from Nicholas Courchesne) and does **not** sit on the Compensation Committee. Nancy serves the Church in her Director/Secretary role.

## Section 7. Charter

The detailed charter of the Compensation Committee, including meeting procedures, documentation requirements, and comparable data protocols, is set forth in [B01 Compensation Committee Charter](./B01-COMPENSATION-COMMITTEE-CHARTER.md).

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **State-specific reconciliation:** Reconcile all provisions with the nonprofit corporation act of the chosen state. Particular attention to: director removal thresholds, life tenure provisions, amendment lock enforceability, indemnification scope.
2. **Life tenure enforceability:** Confirm that irremovable director provisions are enforceable under state law. Some states have statutory removal rights that may override bylaws. Religious corporation statutes may provide broader latitude.
3. **Amendment lock validity:** Confirm that the triple amendment lock structure (Senior Pastor lock, Co-Founder lock, Mutual lock) is enforceable. Are there state-law limitations on restricting future boards from amending bylaws?
4. **Governance Pause — state law:** Is the Governance Pause mechanism (temporary suspension of operational authority without removal) recognized under state nonprofit corporation law? Or must it be framed as a "leave of absence" with specific statutory language?
5. **5/7 supermajority:** Is 83% (5 of 6 voting members) considered too high a removal threshold under state law? Would a 2/3 threshold be more defensible while still requiring a high bar?
6. **Relationship prohibition:** Is an outright ban on romantic relationships between board members enforceable? Should it be framed as a conflict-of-interest policy instead?
7. **New Spouse Veto:** Is a perpetual mutual veto on board appointments enforceable? What happens if one co-founder becomes incapacitated but is not deceased?
8. **Dollar thresholds:** All $[bracketed] amounts require state-specific review and founder input. These are placeholders.
