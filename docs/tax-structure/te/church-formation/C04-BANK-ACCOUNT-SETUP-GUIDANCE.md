## Preamble

Money is energy. Where it is stored, how it flows, and who guards it reveals the character of the institution that holds it. The Church of the Living Light does not treat its financial infrastructure as an administrative afterthought. Every account, every signatory, every threshold for dual authorization is a deliberate choice — designed to protect the mission, honor the seventh generation, and withstand any scrutiny that may come.

Three accounts. Three purposes. Complete segregation between what the Church receives from its commercial relationships and what the Church spends on its ministry. The PPA distributions that fund the Church's mission flow into a walled garden — a dedicated account that cannot be commingled with operating expenses, cannot be accessed by a single signatory, and cannot be drawn upon without a paper trail. This is not distrust. It is discipline. And discipline is the foundation of stewardship.

The banking structure described here is not merely operational guidance. It is a governance commitment — that the Church's financial architecture will be as intentional as its spiritual architecture, and that every dollar will be traceable from source to purpose.

## PART I — THREE REQUIRED BANK ACCOUNTS

### Section 1. Account Structure

The Church of the Living Light shall maintain three segregated bank accounts, as established by the Bylaws (Article V, Section 2):

---

#### Account 1: Operating Account

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Day-to-day ministry expenses: payroll, rent/utilities, ministry programs, supplies, insurance, travel, professional fees, charitable program costs, and all other operational expenditures |
| **Funding sources** | Transfers from PPA Distribution Account (authorized), tithes and donations, licensing royalties, conference/event revenue, other ministry income |
| **Signatories** | **Timothy Lawless** (Treasurer) + **Sydney Griffith** (Compensation Committee Chair) |
| **Signature requirements** | Single signature: transactions below $10,000. **Dual signature: transactions at or above $10,000.** |
| **Check/debit authority** | Treasurer has day-to-day access for routine transactions below $10,000 |
| **Online banking** | Full online access for both signatories; Treasurer manages day-to-day; Sydney reviews and co-authorizes as needed |

**Why Sydney Griffith as co-signatory.** Sydney is independent — not a family member of Daniel, not an employee, not a beneficiary of any Church compensation decision. Her signature on Operating Account transactions above $10,000 provides independent financial oversight, separate from the Lawless family's operational control. This is a governance choice, not a convenience.

---

#### Account 2: PPA Distribution Account

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Purpose** | **Receives all Profit Participation Agreement distributions from Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC (Dubai) and Light Brands Consulting Ltd (Cook Islands).** This is the Church's primary revenue account for PPA income. It is **strictly segregated** from the Operating Account. |
| **Funding sources** | PPA distributions from LBS (30% + 10% if applicable) and LBC (30% + 10% if applicable) — international wire transfers |
| **Signatories** | **Timothy Lawless** (Treasurer) + **Nancy Courchesne** (Secretary) |
| **Signature requirements** | **Dual signature required on ALL transactions — no exceptions.** Every withdrawal, every transfer, every wire from this account requires both signatures. |
| **Online banking** | Both signatories have view access; transactions require dual electronic authorization |
| **Permitted transactions** | (a) Receive incoming PPA distributions; (b) Transfer to Operating Account (authorized by Finance Committee or Council resolution); (c) Transfer to Reserve/Investment Account (authorized by Council resolution); (d) Direct payment of PPA-related expenses (e.g., PPA counsel fees, audit rights exercise) |
| **Prohibited transactions** | (a) Direct payment of Operating expenses (must transfer to Operating Account first); (b) Single-signatory transactions of any kind; (c) Cash withdrawals; (d) Debit card transactions |

**Why strict segregation.** The PPA distributions are the Church's primary revenue stream. Segregation serves three purposes:

(a) **Audit trail** — every PPA dollar is traceable from international receipt to ministry deployment;

(b) **Governance** — no single person can access PPA funds without a second signatory's authorization;

(c) **Defense** — if the IRS, a state AG, or any other party ever questions the Church's financial management, the segregated PPA account demonstrates that the Church treats PPA income as a distinct fiduciary obligation, not a personal piggy bank.

**PPA funds must never commingle with operating funds.** The transfer from PPA Distribution Account to Operating Account is the Church's internal "funding decision" — it requires dual authorization, and it creates a documented record that ministry leadership consciously decided how much PPA revenue to deploy for operations.

---

#### Account 3: Reserve / Investment Account

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Long-term reserves, surplus investment, emergency fund, and accumulation of funds for major future expenditures (property acquisition, capital improvements, endowment-building) |
| **Funding sources** | Transfers from PPA Distribution Account (authorized), Operating Account surplus (authorized), investment income, any other designated funds |
| **Signatories** | Any **two (2)** of: **Timothy Lawless** (Treasurer), **Daniel Lawless** (Senior Pastor), **Sydney Griffith** (Compensation Committee Chair) |
| **Signature requirements** | **Dual signature required on ALL transactions.** Any two of three signatories must authorize. |
| **Investment authority** | The Finance Committee shall recommend investment policy to the Spiritual Council. Investments shall be limited to: (a) FDIC-insured deposits, (b) U.S. Treasury securities, (c) investment-grade bonds, (d) diversified mutual funds, (e) other investments approved by Council resolution. No speculative investments. |
| **Withdrawal authority** | Withdrawals require Council resolution or standing Finance Committee authorization |

| **Articles of Incorporation** (certified copy) | State filing authority | Proves the Church is a legally formed corporation |
| **Church Bylaws** | Church records | Proves governance structure; bank may review signatory provisions |
| **Organizational meeting minutes** (Document A04) | Church records | Proves the Council authorized account opening and designated signatories |
| **Board resolution authorizing accounts** | Organizational meeting minutes (Section XI) | Specific resolution authorizing each account, naming signatories, and specifying signature requirements |
| **Government-issued photo ID** for all signatories | Each signatory | Required for identity verification; typically driver's license or passport |
| **Social Security Number or ITIN** for all signatories | Each signatory | Required for beneficial ownership and CDD (Customer Due Diligence) |

| **IRS determination letter** (if available) | IRS | Not required for 508(c)(1)(A) churches (automatic exemption), but some banks request it. Provide a letter from counsel explaining automatic church exemption status in lieu of a determination letter. |

### Section 5. Beneficial Ownership Reporting

Under the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rule, the bank must identify:

(a) Each individual who directly or indirectly owns 25% or more of the entity (for the Church, this is N/A — no individual owns any interest);

(b) One individual with significant managerial responsibility (typically the Senior Pastor or Treasurer).

The Treasurer shall complete the Beneficial Ownership Certification form, identifying:

| Field | Entry |
|-------|-------|
| Legal entity name | Church of the Living Light |
| Entity type | Nonprofit religious corporation |
| EIN | [To be obtained] |
| Individual with significant management responsibility | Timothy Lawless, Treasurer |
| Ownership interest holders | None — nonprofit corporation with no individual owners |

## PART IV — WIRE TRANSFER SETUP

### Section 6. International Wire Transfers

The Church will receive PPA distributions via international wire transfer from:

| Source | Jurisdiction | Sending Bank (anticipated) | Currency |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC** | Dubai, UAE | [UAE bank — to be confirmed] | USD (or AED converted to USD) |
| **Light Brands Consulting Ltd** | Cook Islands | [Cook Islands bank — to be confirmed] | USD (or NZD converted to USD) |

**Wire transfer setup requirements:**

(a) **Provide wire instructions to LBS and LBC** — the Church's PPA Distribution Account routing number, account number, SWIFT/BIC code, and bank address;

(b) **Confirm the bank can receive wires from UAE and Cook Islands** — some banks flag or delay wires from certain jurisdictions. Establish a relationship with the bank's international wire department in advance;

(c) **Set up wire notifications** — both signatories (Timothy and Nancy) should receive automatic email/text notifications when an international wire is received;

(d) **Establish expected wire amounts and frequency** — provide the bank's compliance department with a letter explaining the nature of the expected wire transfers (PPA distributions from commercial entities in which the Church holds profit participation interests). This proactive disclosure reduces the likelihood of compliance holds or suspicious activity reports;

(e) **Document each wire received** — match every incoming wire to the corresponding PPA distribution notice from LBS or LBC. File documentation in the PPA Distribution Account records.

### Section 7. Domestic Wire and ACH Transfers

For transfers between Church accounts and domestic transactions:

| Transfer Type | From | To | Authorization |
|--------------|------|-----|---------------|
| PPA to Operating | PPA Distribution Account | Operating Account | Dual authorization (Timothy + Nancy) |
| PPA to Reserve | PPA Distribution Account | Reserve / Investment Account | Dual authorization (Timothy + Nancy) + Council resolution |
| Operating to Reserve | Operating Account | Reserve / Investment Account | Treasurer (single, if under $10K) or dual (Timothy + Sydney, if $10K+) |
| Reserve to Operating | Reserve / Investment Account | Operating Account | Dual authorization (any 2 of 3 signatories) + Council resolution or Finance Committee authorization |

---

## PART V — INTERNATIONAL BANKING CONSIDERATIONS

### Section 8. FATCA Compliance

The **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)** requires foreign financial institutions to report information about accounts held by U.S. persons. The Church's relationship to FATCA is as follows:

(a) **The Church is a U.S. entity.** It holds U.S. bank accounts. It does not hold foreign bank accounts. FATCA applies primarily to U.S. persons with foreign accounts — not to the receipt of incoming wires from foreign entities.

(b) **LBS and LBC are foreign entities** paying distributions to the Church. The foreign banks may require the Church to provide a **W-9** (confirming U.S. taxpayer status) or a **W-8BEN-E** (certifying the Church's status as a tax-exempt entity). The Treasurer should be prepared to provide these forms.

(c) **FBAR filing:** If the Church holds any foreign bank account with a balance exceeding $10,000 at any point during the year, FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR) must be filed. Currently, the Church does not hold foreign accounts — all accounts are domestic. If this changes, FBAR compliance must be addressed.

### Section 9. Beneficial Ownership Reporting (Corporate Transparency Act)

The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) requires certain entities to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. **Churches and other 501(c)(3) organizations are currently exempt** from CTA reporting requirements. However:

(a) The Treasurer should confirm the Church's exemption with counsel;

(b) The exemption applies to the Church itself — it does not necessarily apply to other entities in the organizational structure;

(c) If the CTA exemption is modified or revoked, the Church must comply with reporting requirements.

### Section 10. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Considerations

Banks are required to maintain Anti-Money Laundering programs and may flag large or unusual transactions. To minimize compliance friction:

(a) **Proactive disclosure** — provide the bank with a written explanation of the Church's revenue model (PPA distributions from UAE and Cook Islands entities, tithes, donations, licensing royalties);

(b) **Consistent patterns** — establish expected distribution frequency and approximate amounts with the bank's compliance team;

(c) **Documentation** — maintain complete records of all PPA distributions, including distribution notices, wire confirmations, and PPA reconciliation records;

(d) **Respond promptly** — if the bank requests additional information regarding a transaction, respond through counsel promptly and completely.

## PART VI — ACCOUNT SEGREGATION IMPORTANCE

### Section 11. Why Segregation Matters

The segregation of PPA funds from operating funds is not an optional best practice. It is a governance requirement embedded in the Bylaws and this guidance for three reasons:

**1. Fiduciary integrity.** PPA distributions represent the economic return on Daniel's irrevocable assignment of his profit participation interests to the Church. They are the Church's primary revenue stream. Treating them with the same discipline as trust funds — segregated, dual-authorized, fully reconciled — demonstrates that the Church takes its fiduciary obligations seriously.

**2. Audit defense.** If the IRS initiates a church tax inquiry under IRC 7611, the first thing examined will be how the Church receives and deploys PPA income. A segregated PPA Distribution Account with dual-signature controls and a complete paper trail demonstrates intentional, disciplined financial management — the opposite of what the IRS would need to show to challenge the Church's exempt status.

**3. Governance accountability.** The segregated account structure ensures that no single individual can access PPA funds unilaterally. Even the Treasurer — who is Daniel's brother — cannot withdraw PPA funds without Nancy Courchesne's co-signature. This dual-signatory requirement between a Lawless family member (Timothy) and a non-Lawless family member (Nancy) creates a natural check on fund deployment.

### Section 12. Prohibited Commingling

The following are expressly prohibited:

(a) Depositing PPA distribution funds into the Operating Account or Reserve Account directly (all PPA funds must first be deposited into the PPA Distribution Account);

(b) Using the PPA Distribution Account to pay operating expenses directly (funds must be transferred to the Operating Account first);

(c) Using a single bank account for both PPA distributions and operating transactions;

(d) Allowing any signatory to access PPA funds without dual authorization;

(e) Holding PPA funds in any personal account, even temporarily.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Bank selection:** Does counsel have a recommendation for a specific bank with church banking experience and international wire capability from UAE and Cook Islands? Any banks to avoid?
2. **Compliance letter:** Should counsel prepare a letter to the bank explaining the Church's PPA revenue model, to be provided at account opening to preempt AML/compliance concerns?
3. **IRS determination letter alternative:** Some banks require an IRS determination letter for tax-exempt entities. Since 508(c)(1)(A) churches do not apply for a determination letter, should counsel prepare a legal opinion letter confirming the Church's automatic exempt status, to be provided to the bank in lieu of a determination letter?
4. **FATCA and CTA:** Confirm the Church's current obligations (or exemptions) under FATCA, FBAR, and the Corporate Transparency Act. If any reporting is required, add procedures to this document and to Document C01 (Audit Procedures).
5. **Deposit insurance:** If account balances exceed $250,000 FDIC limits, should the Church spread deposits across multiple banks or use IntraFi (formerly CDARS) for extended FDIC coverage?
6. **Investment policy:** Should the Church adopt a formal investment policy statement governing the Reserve/Investment Account? If so, should it be a standalone document or incorporated here?
