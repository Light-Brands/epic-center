## Overview

The Church of the Living Light obtains its Employer Identification Number (EIN) by filing **IRS Form SS-4**. As a 508(c)(1)(A) church, the church is **automatically tax-exempt** and does not need to file Form 1023 or Form 1023-EZ. The EIN is needed for bank accounts, employment, and operational purposes — not for tax-exempt status.

## What the Church Does NOT Need to File

| Form | Required? | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Form 1023 (Application for Recognition of Exemption)** | **NO** | Churches under IRC 508(c)(1)(A) are automatically exempt. No application required. |
| **Form 1023-EZ** | **NO** | Same — automatic exemption for churches. |
| **Form 990 (Annual Return)** | **NO** | Churches are specifically exempt from Form 990 filing under IRC 6033(a)(3)(A)(i). |
| **Form 990-N (e-Postcard)** | **NO** | Same exemption — churches do not file any variant of Form 990. |
| **State registration (charitable solicitation)** | **Check state law** | Some states exempt churches from charitable solicitation registration. Others require it. Counsel to advise for state of incorporation. |

## Important: Do NOT Apply for 501(c)(3) Determination Letter

The church does **not** need and should **not** apply for a formal IRS determination letter (Form 1023). Applying would:

1. Subject the church to the application review process unnecessarily
2. Potentially invite IRS scrutiny that does not otherwise exist
3. Create an expectation of Form 990 filing (which churches are exempt from)
4. Provide zero additional benefit — donors can deduct contributions to churches without a determination letter (IRC 170(b)(1)(A)(i))

The church is **already exempt** by operation of law under IRC 508(c)(1)(A). A determination letter is not needed for donors, banks, or any other purpose.

If a bank or vendor requests a "tax-exempt determination letter," provide instead:

1. A copy of the Articles of Incorporation (showing religious/charitable purpose)
2. A copy of the Bylaws (showing church governance structure)
3. A letter from the church attorney confirming 508(c)(1)(A) status
4. IRS Publication 557 (Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization) — pages referencing church automatic exemption

## Who Is the "Responsible Party"?

The IRS requires a **responsible party** — an individual (not entity) who controls, manages, or directs the entity and the disposition of its funds and assets. For the church:

**Primary responsible party:** Timothy Lawless (Treasurer and Director of Operations)

**Why Timothy, not Daniel:** While Daniel is Senior Pastor and Chairman, using the Treasurer as the responsible party is common practice for churches. It reflects the operational reality that the Treasurer manages the church's financial accounts. Counsel may advise differently.

**Alternative:** Daniel Lawless (Senior Pastor). Either is acceptable. The responsible party designation does not create tax liability — it is an administrative designation for IRS correspondence.

---

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **State of incorporation requirements:** Does the state require any additional filings concurrent with EIN application (e.g., state tax ID, employment registration)?
2. **Responsible party selection:** Confirm whether Timothy or Daniel should be listed. Consider Daniel's Dubai residency — does a non-US-resident responsible party create complications?
3. **State charitable solicitation:** Does the state of incorporation exempt churches from charitable solicitation registration? If not, file concurrently.
4. **Employment accounts:** Does the church need state unemployment insurance accounts? Churches are generally exempt from FUTA (IRC 3306(c)(8)) but state rules vary.
5. **Form 941/W-2 obligations:** Ministers are employees for income tax purposes but can elect out of FICA via Form 4361. Confirm payroll setup requirements.
