## Cross-References

| Document | Relationship |
|----------|-------------|
| [B01 Compensation Committee Charter](./B01-COMPENSATION-COMMITTEE-CHARTER.md) | The Charter that governs the Committee whose meetings this template documents |
| [B02 Initial Compensation Resolutions](./B02-INITIAL-COMPENSATION-RESOLUTIONS.md) | First compensation determinations documented using this template format |
| [E05 Board Meeting Minutes Template](./E05-BOARD-MEETING-MINUTES-TEMPLATE.md) | Companion template for full Spiritual Council meetings |

## Purpose

This template provides the standard format for recording the minutes of the **Compensation Committee** of the Spiritual Council. It is also adaptable for the Finance Committee, Nominations Committee, or any other standing or ad hoc committee of the Church.

### CRITICAL: 26 CFR 53.4958-6 Compliance

This template is **essential** for maintaining the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness under 26 CFR 53.4958-6 (Intermediate Sanctions). Every compensation decision made by the Compensation Committee must be documented in this format — or a format that captures at least this level of detail — to satisfy the contemporaneous documentation requirement.

If the Committee follows the six-step process set forth in the Compensation Committee Charter (B01) and documents it using this template, the burden of proving that compensation is unreasonable shifts to the IRS. If the Committee fails to document properly, the burden falls on the Church. The difference between these two positions is the difference between a defensible structure and a vulnerable one.

**There is no acceptable excuse for incomplete minutes.**

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Contemporaneous documentation sufficiency:** Confirm that this template, when completed in real time during the meeting, satisfies the contemporaneous documentation requirement of 26 CFR 53.4958-6(b)(3). Is there any additional element the IRS has identified in guidance or enforcement actions as necessary?
2. **Electronic records:** Can these minutes be maintained electronically (digital signatures, cloud storage), or does the Church need to maintain physical originals? What level of security is required for electronic storage of compensation records?
3. **Secretary presence during deliberation:** Confirm that the Secretary (Nancy Courchesne) may be present during compensation deliberations for record-keeping purposes only, notwithstanding her exclusion from the Committee due to IRC 4958 spousal attribution. Does her presence in any way compromise the independence of the deliberation?
4. **Comparable data attachment:** Should the comparable data summary be physically attached to the minutes, or is a reference to separately filed documents sufficient? What is the best practice for maintaining the evidentiary chain?
5. **Multiple determinations in one meeting:** When the Committee makes multiple compensation determinations in a single meeting (e.g., Senior Pastor + Co-Founder + Treasurer), should each determination be documented as a separate proceeding with separate exclusion confirmations, or is a single meeting with sequential determinations sufficient?
