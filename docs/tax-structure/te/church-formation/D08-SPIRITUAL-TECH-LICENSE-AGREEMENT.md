## Preamble

The spiritual technologies of the Church of the Living Light are the fruit of revelation and practice. They are not invented — they are received, tested, and refined through the lived experience of the Church's ministers. A healing framework is not a business methodology dressed in sacred language. It is the architecture of transformation itself — the way a human being moves from suffering to wholeness, from fragmentation to integration, from darkness to light.

When the Church licenses these spiritual technologies, it does so with the understanding that the work of healing is too important to be hoarded and too sacred to be given away without covenant. This license is the covenant. LBC receives the right to deploy the Church's proprietary spiritual practices in its consulting work. The Church receives royalty — not as payment for a commodity, but as the natural return of an investment of spirit. What the Church has poured into its healing frameworks, the universe returns through the economics of sacred exchange.

## 4. Licensed Technology

### 4.1 Scope of License

The Church hereby grants to LBC an exclusive license to use, deploy, adapt, and sublicense (within the TE entity ecosystem only) the following categories of spiritual technology (collectively, the "Licensed Technology"):

| Category | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **Spiritual methodologies** | Systematic approaches to spiritual development, transformation, and healing created by the Church's ministers, including step-by-step protocols, assessment frameworks, and progression models |
| **Healing frameworks** | Proprietary structures for facilitating physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, including energy work protocols, prayer-based healing sequences, somatic-spiritual integration practices, and trauma-informed spiritual care models |
| **Proprietary church practices** | Distinctive practices developed by the Church that are not part of the general public domain, including specific meditation sequences, breathwork protocols, ceremony structures, and integration techniques |
| **Spiritual technology** | Any systematized spiritual knowledge, tools, or techniques that the Church has developed, documented, and designated as proprietary, including digital applications of spiritual practices |

### 4.2 New Technology

The license shall automatically extend to new Licensed Technology created by the Church during the term of this Agreement that falls within the categories described in Section 4.1, unless the Church provides written notice excluding specific technology from the license within thirty (30) days of its creation.

### 4.3 Exclusivity

The license is exclusive to LBC and its affiliated TE entities. The Church shall not license the same Licensed Technology to any third party outside the TE ecosystem during the term of this Agreement. The Church retains the right to use the Licensed Technology for its own ministry purposes, including worship services, pastoral care, congregational healing, ordination training, and direct church activities.

## 5. Royalty

### 5.1 Royalty Rate

LBC shall pay to the Church a royalty equal to [__]% of Net Consulting Revenue derived from engagements that deploy Licensed Technology (the "Royalty").

**Counsel Note:** The royalty rate must be established through a transfer pricing study. Comparable rates for methodology licensing in the consulting, wellness, and professional services industries shall be documented. The rate must be arm's length — defensible under OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and applicable domestic tax law.

### 5.2 Royalty Calculation Methodology

```
Gross Revenue from LBC consulting engagements deploying Licensed Technology
  minus Direct engagement costs (subcontractor fees, travel, materials)
  minus Client refunds and credits
  = NET CONSULTING REVENUE

Royalty = [__]% x Net Consulting Revenue
```

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Deploying Licensed Technology** | A consulting engagement "deploys" Licensed Technology if the engagement uses, incorporates, or is materially based upon the Church's proprietary spiritual methodologies, healing frameworks, or practices |
| **Revenue allocation** | If a consulting engagement includes both Licensed Technology and non-church methodologies, revenue shall be allocated on a reasonable basis (e.g., proportional to methodology hours, deliverable components, or other verifiable metric). Allocation methodology to be agreed annually and documented. |
| **Minimum royalty** | [Counsel to advise — should there be a minimum annual royalty?] |

### 5.3 Payment Schedule

| Quarter | Period | Royalty Due Date |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Q1 | January 1 -- March 31 | May 15 |
| Q2 | April 1 -- June 30 | August 15 |
| Q3 | July 1 -- September 30 | November 15 |
| Q4 | October 1 -- December 31 | February 15 (following year) |

Each royalty payment shall be accompanied by a Royalty Statement detailing:
- Gross revenue from engagements deploying Licensed Technology
- Direct engagement cost deductions
- Net Consulting Revenue calculation
- Revenue allocation methodology (if applicable)
- Royalty amount due

### 5.4 Currency and Payment Method

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Currency** | United States Dollars (USD) |
| **Withholding** | Zero — Cook Islands IBCs are not subject to income tax or withholding tax on international payments |
| **Payment method** | Wire transfer to the Church's designated Royalty Account |

## 6. Applicable Bulletproof Principles

The following principles from the Governing Framework apply to this license with the same force as they apply to the PPA agreements.

### Principle 1: Profit Participation (via Royalty)

The Church participates in the economic success of LBC's consulting practice through its royalty. As LBC revenue grows from engagements deploying the Church's spiritual technology, the Church's royalty income grows proportionally.

### Principle 3: Distribution Parity

Royalty payments are made on the same quarterly schedule as PPA distributions. LBC shall not delay royalty payments while making other distributions to equity holders or PPA holders.

### Principle 5: Irrevocability

This license survives changes in leadership, entity restructuring, and any modification of the relationship between the parties. The license cannot be terminated by LBC without cause. The Church's IP ownership is permanent and irrevocable.

### Principle 7: Non-Subordination

LBC shall not incur debt, management fees, or intercompany charges that reduce the revenue base from which the Church's royalty is calculated, except for ordinary operating expenses. The royalty obligation ranks senior to management fees and advisory fees not classified as operating expenses.

### Principle 9: Audit Rights

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Church audit right** | The Church may engage its own auditor to examine LBC's books and records related to royalty calculation, at the Church's expense, once per fiscal year, with thirty (30) days' written notice |
| **Royalty verification** | The Church may request a detailed calculation of Net Consulting Revenue and royalty for any payment period |
| **Records retention** | LBC shall maintain complete records supporting royalty calculations for a minimum of seven (7) years |
| **Underpayment** | If an audit reveals underpayment of royalty by more than 5%, LBC shall pay the shortfall plus interest at [__]% per annum, and LBC shall bear the cost of the audit |

### Principle 10: Information Rights

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Quarterly royalty statement** | Detailed calculation per Section 5.3, within fifteen (15) days of quarter end |
| **Annual report** | Summary of all LBC engagements deploying Licensed Technology, revenue by engagement type, and aggregate royalty for the fiscal year |
| **Material event notification** | Prompt written notice of: new consulting service lines deploying Licensed Technology, discontinuation of service lines, material changes to pricing, regulatory actions |

### Principle 11: Specific Performance

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Remedy** | The Church may seek specific performance for any breach, including court-ordered royalty payment and compliance with license terms |
| **Injunctive relief** | The Church may seek injunctive relief to prevent unauthorized use of Licensed Technology or breach of exclusivity provisions |
| **Acceleration** | If LBC defaults on royalty payments for two (2) or more consecutive quarters, all accrued and estimated future royalties for the balance of the fiscal year accelerate and become immediately payable |
| **Costs** | The prevailing party in any dispute shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs |

### Principle 12: Survival

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Re-domiciliation** | If LBC moves to a new jurisdiction, all license terms survive and bind the successor entity |
| **Entity conversion** | If LBC changes legal form, all license terms survive |
| **Restructuring** | If LBC merges, spins off, or reorganizes, the license and royalty obligation attach to the successor or surviving entity |
| **Post-termination** | Upon termination, LBC shall cease all deployment of Licensed Technology within ninety (90) days. Royalty obligations for the period through termination survive. Audit rights survive for three (3) years post-termination. |

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Royalty rate:** What is the arm's-length royalty rate for methodology/spiritual technology licensing in the consulting industry? Counsel should commission a transfer pricing study. Comparable rates for proprietary methodology licensing in consulting and professional services typically range from 5-20% of engagement revenue — confirm with study.

2. **Derivative works:** The Agreement provides for joint ownership of derivative works (Church owns underlying methodology, LBC owns client-specific application). Is this the optimal structure? Should the Church own all derivative works outright?

3. **Revenue allocation methodology:** For engagements blending Licensed Technology with non-church methodologies, how should revenue be allocated? This allocation must be defensible under transfer pricing rules.

4. **Cook Islands enforceability:** Are specific performance and injunctive relief available under Cook Islands law for IP license breaches? What enforcement mechanisms are strongest in the Cook Islands High Court?

5. **UBIT analysis:** Confirm that royalty income from this license is exempt from Unrelated Business Income Tax under IRC 512(b)(2). If the Church provides training or consulting alongside the license, could the IRS recharacterize royalty as service income subject to UBIT?

6. **Interaction with D07 (Content License):** This agreement (spiritual technology to LBC) and D07 (spiritual content to Holdings) cover different IP categories going to different entities. Counsel should confirm there is no overlap in scope and that the transfer pricing for each license stands on its own arm's-length basis.

7. **Interaction with PPA:** The Church receives PPA distributions from LBC (D04, 30%) and royalty payments from LBC (this Agreement). These are separate economic streams — PPA is profit participation, royalty is IP compensation. Confirm no double-counting and that both are UBIT-exempt.

8. **Cook Islands withholding:** Confirm zero withholding on royalty payments from a Cook Islands IBC to a US 508(c)(1)(A) church. Cook Islands IBCs are exempt from income tax on international income — confirm this extends to royalty payments to foreign entities.
