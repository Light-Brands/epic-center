## Spiritual Preamble

*You were not chosen. You were recognized.*

*Ordination in the Church of the Living Light is not the conferring of authority from an institution to an individual. It is the recognition — by a community, by its pastors, by the Living Light itself — that a soul has heard its call and answered.*

*Sacred Law 46 — the Law of Dharmic Direction — teaches that each soul carries a unique calling. Some carry it quietly, expressed in the way they hold space for another's grief. Some carry it publicly, in the words they speak from the front of the room. Neither is greater. Both are necessary. The church's role is not to create ministers. It is to recognize the ministry that already lives within a person and to prepare them to serve with wisdom, integrity, and depth.*

*The Divine Value of Evolution reminds us that the soul's growth never stops. Ordination is not a destination. It is a beginning — the moment the student becomes the servant, the seeker becomes the shepherd, the one who was held becomes the one who holds.*

*Daniel and Jennifer designed this curriculum together because they believe that the ministers of the Living Light must be more than charismatic. They must be grounded. They must know the Sacred Laws not as theory but as lived experience. They must understand governance not as bureaucracy but as stewardship. They must be prepared to lead worship, to sit with suffering, to build community, and to carry the weight of sacred responsibility without breaking under it.*

*This is the path. Walk it with reverence.*

## PART I — PURPOSE AND IRS COMPLIANCE

### Section 1. Purpose

This document establishes the ordination program of the Church of the Living Light (the "Church"). The program provides a structured course of study, mentorship, and supervised ministry through which candidates are prepared for ordination as ministers of the Church.

### Section 2. IRS 14-Point Test Compliance

The ordination program directly satisfies two of the fourteen characteristics the IRS uses to identify churches:

| IRS Point | Characteristic | How This Program Satisfies |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Point 7** | Organization of ordained ministers | The Church maintains an organized body of ordained ministers who have completed this program |
| **Point 8** | Ordained ministers selected after completing prescribed studies | Ministers are ordained only after completing all seven curriculum modules, a mentorship period, and supervised ministry |

### Section 3. Tax Benefits for Ordained Ministers

Ordained ministers of the Church may qualify for the following tax provisions:

(a) **IRC 107 — Housing Allowance.** Ordained ministers who perform sacerdotal functions and conduct religious worship may exclude from gross income the amount designated by the Compensation Committee as a housing allowance, up to the lesser of (i) the amount designated, (ii) actual housing costs, or (iii) the fair rental value of the home (furnished, plus utilities).

(b) **Form 4361 — Exemption from Self-Employment Tax.** Ordained ministers may apply for exemption from FICA/SE tax by filing Form 4361, certifying conscientious opposition to acceptance of public insurance benefits based on religious principles.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **State-specific ordination requirements:** Do any states impose specific requirements for church ordination programs that must be satisfied for the minister to legally perform ceremonies (marriages, etc.)? Should the program include state-specific supplementary modules?
2. **IRC 107 eligibility confirmation:** Confirm that ministers ordained through this program, who perform sacerdotal functions and conduct religious worship for the Church, satisfy the IRS definition of "minister of the gospel" for purposes of the housing allowance exclusion.
3. **Form 4361 timing:** At what point in the ordination process should the Church advise newly ordained ministers of their right to file Form 4361? Is there a deadline relative to ordination?
4. **Online/digital ordination validity:** As the Church grows its digital ministry, can portions of this curriculum be completed remotely while still satisfying the IRS requirement that ministers are "selected after completing prescribed studies"?
5. **Ordination credential portability:** If an ordained minister leaves the Church, does the ordination remain valid for purposes of other religious organizations? Does this create any liability for the Church?
