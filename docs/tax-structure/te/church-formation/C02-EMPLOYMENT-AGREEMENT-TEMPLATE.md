## Preamble

To serve in the ministry of the Church of the Living Light is to accept a calling. But a calling does not excuse the church from its obligation to sustain the one who is called. The laborer is worthy of their hire, and the steward who gives their life to sacred work deserves a structure that honors that gift with clarity, dignity, and permanence.

This Employment Agreement is the instrument by which the Church fulfills its covenant with those it calls to serve. Every provision exists to protect both the minister and the mission. Compensation is set by an independent body, not by the one who benefits. Housing is designated before the tax year begins, as the law requires. Retirement is funded from the first year, because the seventh generation begins with how we treat the first.

This is not merely a legal document. It is a promise — that the Church will care for its ministers as faithfully as its ministers care for the Church.

(c) **Form 4361 opt-out:** Ordained ministers may apply to the IRS on Form 4361 for exemption from self-employment tax on ministerial earnings. The exemption is based on religious conscience or religious principle — not financial preference. Once approved, the exemption is permanent and irrevocable.

**11.2 Church Obligation.** The Church shall:

(a) Issue W-2 forms to all employees, including ministers;

(b) Report minister salary in Box 1 (wages, tips, other compensation);

(c) **Exclude** the designated housing allowance from Box 1 and report it in Box 14 (other information) with a notation "Housing Allowance — IRC 107";

(d) Not withhold or pay FICA on minister compensation (ministers are self-employed for FICA purposes);

(e) Provide reasonable assistance to ministers in understanding their tax obligations, including referral to a qualified tax advisor.

**11.3 Employee Acknowledgment.** The Employee acknowledges that the Employee is responsible for:

(a) Filing and paying all federal and state income taxes;

(b) Filing and paying self-employment tax (unless Form 4361 exemption is approved);

(c) Maintaining adequate records of housing expenses to substantiate the housing allowance exclusion;

(d) Consulting with a qualified tax advisor regarding the Employee's specific tax situation.

### ARTICLE 12 — GENERAL PROVISIONS

**12.1 Entire Agreement.** This Agreement, together with Schedules A and B, constitutes the entire agreement between the Church and the Employee regarding the terms of employment. All prior negotiations, representations, and understandings are superseded.

**12.3 Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of [State].

**12.4 Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **At-will vs. defined term:** For the Senior Pastor and Co-Founder positions, should the employment agreement provide for a defined term (e.g., lifetime) consistent with the Bylaws, or is at-will employment with Bylaws protections sufficient?
2. **Non-solicitation enforceability:** Confirm that a 12-month non-solicitation of church members and donors is enforceable in the state of incorporation. Some states limit non-solicitation provisions; religious organizations may have broader latitude.
3. **Minister dual-status confirmation:** Confirm the dual-status treatment (employee for income tax, self-employed for FICA) applies to all ordained ministers of the Church, including those ordained through the Church's own ordination program.
4. **Form 4361 timing:** Ministers must apply for the Form 4361 FICA exemption by the due date of the tax return for the second year in which they have $400+ of ministerial earnings. Confirm that the Church's employment onboarding process includes notification of this deadline.
5. **Housing allowance in retirement:** Confirm that 403(b)(9) plan distributions can be designated as housing allowance for retired ministers, providing tax-free withdrawals. This is a critical component of the retirement strategy (see Document C03).
6. **Arbitration clause:** Is mandatory binding arbitration appropriate for a church employment agreement? Should there be a carve-out for claims that cannot be arbitrated under applicable law?
7. **State-specific employment provisions:** Review for compliance with the employment laws of the state where the Employee will perform services, including wage payment timing, leave requirements, and termination notice requirements.
