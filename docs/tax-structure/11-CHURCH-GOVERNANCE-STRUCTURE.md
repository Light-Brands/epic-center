# Church of the Living Light — Governance & Bylaws Framework

> **Status:** Draft — requires religious nonprofit attorney review before formation
> **Last Updated:** February 2026
> **Entity Type:** 508(c)(1)(A) Church (automatic tax exemption, no IRS application required)
> **Model:** Kenneth Copeland Ministries governance structure

---

## 1. TL;DR

The Church of the Living Light is structured so that **Daniel Lawless is the irremovable founding Senior Pastor with life tenure, doctrinal authority over all ministry decisions, board nomination power, budget authority, and succession rights.** The Spiritual Council (board) includes three Lawless family members, one aligned co-founder representative (Nancy Courchesne), and three independent members. The Compensation Committee (Sydney Griffith, Chair; Iryna Voitenko; Angelina Adelaide) operates by majority vote — all three are genuinely independent with no family or financial ties to Daniel. Daniel's bylaws protections cannot be amended without his consent. The board is majority female (5 of 7).

Daniel is **invisible** to the entire corporate structure except as an employee of LBS (Dubai) for FEIE purposes. The church is the only entity Daniel controls — and through the bylaws, he controls it absolutely.

## 2. Legal Foundation

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Entity Name** | Church of the Living Light |
| **Legal Basis** | IRC 508(c)(1)(A) — automatic tax exemption for churches |
| **State Formation** | [TBD — counsel to advise on optimal state: Texas, Wyoming, Nevada] |
| **IRS Application** | **None required.** Churches are automatically exempt. No Form 1023 needed. |
| **Form 990** | **Not required.** Churches are specifically exempt from Form 990 filing (IRC 6033(a)(3)(A)(i)). No public financial disclosure. |
| **IRS Audit** | Protected by Church Audit Procedures Act (IRC 7611). IRS must follow heightened procedures: Treasury-level approval, written notice, limited scope, time restrictions. |
| **14-Point Test** | Church must meet IRS 14-point criteria for church status (see Section 14 below). |
| **Annual Cost** | ~$500-2,000 (state filing + registered agent). No federal filing fees. |

### Why 508(c)(1)(A) Instead of 501(c)(3)

| | 508(c)(1)(A) Church | 501(c)(3) Nonprofit |
|---|---|---|
| **IRS application** | None — automatic | Must apply (Form 1023) |
| **Form 990** | Not required | Required annually (public) |
| **Financial disclosure** | None | Public |
| **IRS audit** | Church Audit Procedures Act protections | Standard audit rules |
| **Donor deductions** | Yes — same as 501(c)(3) | Yes |
| **UBIT** | Same exemptions (IRC 512(b)) | Same |
| **Governance scrutiny** | Minimal (First Amendment) | Standard nonprofit rules |
| **Board independence** | No specific requirements | State-specific requirements |

**The church structure gives maximum privacy, minimum disclosure, and maximum governance flexibility.**

```

**Two separate vote tracks:** Governance decisions go through the full council (family bloc controls). Compensation decisions go through the independent committee only (Daniel has zero influence).

### 4.3 Why This Composition Works

**Lawless family (3 of 7):** Daniel + Jennifer + Timothy = 3 seats. Not a standalone majority, but with Nancy Courchesne (aligned — represents the Courchesne family interest) = 4 votes on governance matters — a practical majority for ministry direction, budget approval, property acquisition, hiring, and strategic decisions. Daniel's bylaw protections (life tenure, doctrinal authority, amendment lock, veto on appointments) do not depend on vote counts — they are structurally embedded and cannot be changed without Daniel's written consent.

**Nancy Courchesne as Director / Secretary (Seat 4):** Nancy is the wife of Nicholas Courchesne (Light Brands co-founder, 30% PPA holder). She represents the Courchesne family interest on the Spiritual Council and serves as Director of Outreach & Programs and Church Secretary — an active operational role with record-keeping duties. She is deliberately NOT on the Compensation Committee — under IRC 4958, Nancy is a disqualified person through spousal attribution to Nicholas (co-founder with substantial influence). Having a non-Lawless-family member as Church Secretary strengthens governance credibility — official records are maintained by someone outside the immediate family.

**Independent compensation committee (3 of 3, majority vote):** Sydney Griffith (Chair), Iryna Voitenko, and Angelina Adelaide set all compensation by majority vote. All three are genuinely independent — no family ties to Daniel, no financial interest in Light Brands or TE entities. Three independent members following the 26 CFR 53.4958-6 process (comparable data + independent deliberation + documentation) gives the strongest possible rebuttable presumption. Decisions require 2-of-3 majority.

**Board composition: 5 women, 2 men.** Jennifer, Nancy, Sydney, Iryna, and Angelina. Daniel and Timothy are the only male members. This is strong optics for a modern church governance structure.

**The Copeland precedent:** KCM's board includes Kenneth Copeland (founder/chairman), Gloria Copeland (wife), George Pearsons (son-in-law), and additional members. This structure has operated for 50+ years without IRS challenge to governance.

### 4.4 Council Terms and Appointment

| Provision | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Senior Pastor** | Life tenure (see Section 5) |
| **Family members** | Appointed by Senior Pastor. No term limit. Serve at Senior Pastor's discretion. |
| **Independent members** | Nominated by Senior Pastor via Nominations Committee. Confirmed by majority council vote. 3-year renewable terms. |
| **Removal — Family** | Senior Pastor may remove and replace at any time for any reason. |
| **Removal — Independent** | Senior Pastor may recommend removal for "doctrinal misalignment" or by 2/3 council vote for cause. |
| **Vacancies** | Filled by Senior Pastor nomination + majority council vote. |
| **Quorum** | 4 of 7 members (Senior Pastor counts toward quorum). |

### 4.5 What "Independent" Means for IRS Purposes

Independent council members must satisfy ALL of the following:

- Not a family member of Daniel Lawless (spouse, sibling, child, parent, or their spouses)
- Not an employee of the church (council service is voluntary or has nominal stipend only)
- Not a business partner or financial counterparty of Daniel
- Not receiving compensation from any entity in the Light Brands / TE structure
- No financial interest that would be affected by Daniel's compensation

**Compensation Committee (all independent, majority vote):**
- **Sydney Griffith (Chair)** — No family or financial ties to Daniel. Close friend, not a family member under IRC 4958.
- **Iryna Voitenko** — No family or financial ties to Daniel. No financial interest in Light Brands or TE entities.
- **Angelina Adelaide** — No family or financial ties to Daniel.

**Not on Compensation Committee:**
- **Nancy Courchesne** — serves as Director/Secretary. Excluded from Compensation Committee due to spousal attribution from Nicholas Courchesne (co-founder of Light Brands, 30% PPA holder). IRC 4958 disqualified person.

**Key insight:** All three committee members are chosen BY Daniel (he controls the Nominations Committee). He selects people he trusts and who share his vision. They must be genuinely independent for IRS purposes — no family ties, no financial entanglement. Compensation decisions require 2-of-3 majority vote.

## 5. Senior Pastor Protections (The Copeland Shield)

These provisions are embedded in the church bylaws and **cannot be amended without the Senior Pastor's written consent**.

        L7["LAYER 7: AMENDMENT LOCK<br/>Protected articles CANNOT be changed<br/>without Senior Pastor's written consent.<br/>This clause protects itself."]
    end

    L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L4 --> L5 --> L6 --> L7

    style L1 fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style L2 fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style L3 fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style L4 fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style L5 fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style L6 fill:#533483,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
    style L7 fill:#c9770a,stroke:#ffd700,color:#fff
```

**Layer 7 is the master lock.** Even if all other protections were somehow circumvented, the amendment lock prevents anyone from changing the rules without Daniel's consent. And the lock protects itself — it cannot be removed without Daniel's consent either.

### 5.1 Life Tenure

> *"The Senior Pastor shall serve for life or until voluntary resignation. The Senior Pastor may only be removed by unanimous vote of ALL Spiritual Council members (excluding the Senior Pastor) upon a documented finding of: (a) felony conviction in a court of law, (b) proven moral turpitude as determined by the Spiritual Council, or (c) permanent physical or mental incapacity certified by two licensed physicians."*

**What this means:** Daniel cannot be fired. Period. The only paths to removal require unanimity (all 6 other members — including 3 family members — must agree) plus an extreme triggering event. Family members would never vote to remove Daniel, making removal practically impossible.

### 5.2 Doctrinal Authority

> *"The Senior Pastor is the sole and final authority on all matters of doctrine, theology, spiritual direction, ministry vision, and the interpretation of the church's Statement of Faith. No Spiritual Council resolution, committee decision, or congregational vote may override the Senior Pastor's doctrinal determinations. The Senior Pastor's doctrinal authority extends to all ministry programs, content, partnerships, and activities of the church."*

**What this means:** Since everything the church does relates to its spiritual mission, doctrinal authority = operational authority. Want to buy a parsonage? Doctrinal decision (housing the minister is a spiritual function). Want to fund a mission trip? Doctrinal. Want to license spiritual content? Doctrinal. Courts cannot review doctrinal decisions — First Amendment, *Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich* (1976, SCOTUS).

### 5.3 Board Nomination Power

> *"All nominations to the Spiritual Council shall originate from the Nominations Committee, which is chaired by the Senior Pastor. No person may be appointed to the Spiritual Council without the Senior Pastor's affirmative nomination. The Senior Pastor may veto any proposed appointment."*

**What this means:** Nobody gets on the board without Daniel's approval. He controls who sits in every seat.

### 5.4 Board Removal Power

> *"The Senior Pastor may recommend the removal of any Spiritual Council member whose service no longer aligns with the church's doctrinal vision as determined by the Senior Pastor. Upon the Senior Pastor's recommendation, the council shall vote on removal within 30 days. Removal requires a majority vote of the remaining council members."*

**What this means:** If any board member becomes problematic, Daniel recommends removal. With family + aligned members holding 4 of 7 seats (Daniel, Jennifer, Timothy, Nancy), the vote passes automatically.

### 5.5 Budget Authority

> *"The Senior Pastor shall propose the annual ministry budget to the Spiritual Council for approval. The Senior Pastor is authorized to approve expenditures up to $[50,000] per transaction without prior council approval, provided such expenditures are within the approved annual budget and consistent with the church's ministry mission."*

**What this means:** Day-to-day spending decisions are Daniel's. The council approves the overall budget (which Daniel proposes and family majority approves).

### 5.6 Succession

> *"The Senior Pastor shall have the right to designate a successor Senior Pastor by written instrument filed with the Spiritual Council. Upon the Senior Pastor's death, resignation, or incapacity, the designated successor shall assume the role of Senior Pastor subject to ratification by majority council vote. If no designation exists, the Spiritual Council shall select a successor by 2/3 vote from among the church's ordained ministers."*

**What this means:** Daniel decides who leads the church after him. The council ratifies (family majority ensures this).

### 5.7 Amendment Protection (The Master Lock)

> *"No amendment to Article [X] (Senior Pastor), Article [Y] (Doctrinal Authority), or Article [Z] (Succession) of these bylaws shall be valid without the prior written consent of the Senior Pastor. This provision itself may not be amended without the Senior Pastor's consent."*

**What this means:** The rules that protect Daniel cannot be changed without Daniel's agreement. This is the ultimate safeguard — even if the entire board turned against him (impossible with family majority), they cannot strip his protections without his consent.

## 6. Family Roles — Detailed

Each family member holds a genuine ministry role with real responsibilities. These are not ceremonial titles.

### 6.1 Jennifer Lawless — Director of Worship & Community Life

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Council Seat** | Seat 2 |
| **Relationship** | Daniel's wife |
| **Ministry Role** | Leads worship services, manages congregation community, oversees women's ministry, plans community events |
| **Responsibilities** | Weekly worship planning, congregational pastoral care, community outreach coordination, small group ministry |
| **Compensation** | Set by Compensation Committee (Sydney, Iryna, Angelina). Reasonable for role. Separate from Daniel's package. |
| **Recusal** | Recuses from votes on Daniel's compensation (shared household benefit). Votes on all other matters. |

### 6.2 Timothy Lawless — Director of Operations & Administration / Church Treasurer

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Council Seat** | Seat 3 |
| **Relationship** | Daniel's brother |
| **Ministry Role** | Manages church operations, finances, facilities, administration. Serves as Church Treasurer. |
| **Responsibilities** | Financial oversight, vendor management, facility maintenance, compliance calendar, banking relationships, bookkeeping oversight |
| **Compensation** | Set by Compensation Committee. Reasonable for role. |
| **Special Authority** | Co-signatory on church bank accounts (with Sydney Griffith or Nancy Courchesne). Chairs Finance Committee. |
| **Recusal** | Recuses from votes on own compensation. Votes on all other matters including Daniel's compensation (separate household). |

**Note on Timothy's compensation vote for Daniel:** Timothy is a "disqualified person" under IRC 4958 (sibling of person with substantial influence). However, the Compensation Committee (Sydney, Iryna, Angelina) makes the compensation determination. Timothy does NOT sit on the Compensation Committee. Timothy votes on general council matters only. This preserves the rebuttable presumption.

### 6.3 Nancy Courchesne — Director of Outreach & Programs / Church Secretary

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Council Seat** | Seat 4 |
| **Relationship** | Wife of Nicholas Courchesne (Light Brands co-founder, 30% PPA holder). Represents the Courchesne family interest on the council. |
| **Ministry Role** | Manages outreach programs, strategic partnerships, external mission work. Serves as Church Secretary (official record-keeper). |
| **Responsibilities** | Program development, mission trip coordination, strategic partnerships, community outreach, council meeting minutes, record-keeping, maintaining bylaws and resolutions |
| **Compensation** | Council service is voluntary or nominal stipend. If compensated in future, set by Compensation Committee. |
| **Special Authority** | Official record-keeper. Maintains council minutes, resolutions, and bylaws. Co-signatory on PPA Distribution Account (with Timothy). |
| **Comp Committee** | **NOT on Compensation Committee** — excluded due to IRC 4958 spousal attribution from Nicholas (co-founder with substantial influence). Votes on all other council matters. |

**Why Nancy as Secretary strengthens governance:** Having a non-Lawless-family member maintain official church records adds credibility. The IRS sees that meeting minutes, compensation resolutions, and financial decisions are documented by someone outside the immediate Lawless family — reducing any appearance that records are self-serving. Nancy's connection to the Courchesne family interest also provides a governance check — she has a vested interest in proper documentation because her family's PPAs depend on the same entities.

### 6.4 Sydney Griffith — Council Member, Compensation Committee Chair

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Council Seat** | Seat 6 |
| **Relationship** | Independent — close friend of Daniel (not a family member under IRC 4958) |
| **Ministry Role** | Council governance + **Compensation Committee Chair.** Leads all compensation deliberations. Presents comparable data. Chairs annual reviews for all church staff compensation. |
| **Responsibilities** | Leads Compensation Committee (annual review, comparable data analysis, documented deliberations), council governance, program review, Nominations Committee member |
| **Compensation** | Council service is voluntary or nominal stipend. If compensated, amount set by the other two Compensation Committee members (Iryna + Angelina) — Sydney recuses from votes on her own compensation. |
| **Independence** | No family relationship with Daniel. No financial interest in Light Brands or TE entities. Genuinely independent for 26 CFR 53.4958-6 purposes. |

### 6.5 Jason Sparks — Associate Pastor (If Options C/D)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Council Seat** | None initially — can be added as Seat 8 if council expands. Advisory role. |
| **Ministry Role** | Associate Pastor. Assists Senior Pastor in ministry. Focuses on [specific ministry area TBD]. |
| **Responsibilities** | Preaching rotation, ministry content creation, community engagement, [specific programs] |
| **Compensation** | Set by Compensation Committee. Proportionate to ministry role (~1/3 of Daniel's, reflecting 10% vs 30% PPA). |
| **PPA** | 10% PPA in LBS + LBC irrevocably assigned to church (same as Daniel's 30%). |

## 7. The Compensation Committee — IRS Compliance Engine

This is the most critical governance body for tax purposes. It must operate flawlessly.

### 7.1 Composition

| Member | Role | Independence |
|---|---|---|
| **Sydney Griffith (Chair)** | Leads compensation deliberations, presents comparable data, chairs annual reviews | No family ties to Daniel (close friend, not family under IRC 4958). No Light Brands / TE financial interest. Genuinely independent. |
| **Iryna Voitenko** | Reviews compensation, participates in deliberations | No family ties to Daniel. No Light Brands / TE financial interest. Genuinely independent. |
| **Angelina Adelaide** | Reviews compensation for reasonableness | No family ties to Daniel. No Light Brands / TE financial interest. Genuinely independent. |

**Three members, all genuinely independent.** No family members. No church employees. No co-founders. No one with any financial interest affected by compensation decisions. Decisions by **2-of-3 majority vote**. Nancy Courchesne is deliberately excluded from this committee due to spousal attribution from Nicholas Courchesne (co-founder) — she serves the church as Director/Secretary instead.

### 7.2 Process (26 CFR 53.4958-6 Rebuttable Presumption)

The Compensation Committee must follow this exact process for every compensation decision:

| Step | Action | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Comparable Data** | Committee obtains compensation data from comparable organizations (churches of similar size, revenue, and mission) | Written summary of data sources: Copeland Ministries, Lakewood Church, other megachurch compensation surveys, ERI Nonprofit Salary Database |
| **2. Independent Deliberation** | Committee meets without the Senior Pastor (or any person whose compensation is being reviewed) present | Meeting minutes documenting who was present, who was excluded, and the deliberation |
| **3. Decision** | Committee determines compensation amount based on comparables | Written resolution stating the amount, the comparable data relied upon, and the rationale |
| **4. Documentation** | All of the above is documented in contemporaneous meeting minutes | Minutes filed with Church Secretary within 60 days |

**If this process is followed, there is a REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION that the compensation is reasonable.** The IRS must prove it's unreasonable — the burden shifts to them.

### 7.3 What Compensation Covers

The Compensation Committee reviews and approves ALL of the following for each minister:

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Minister salary** | Cash salary, taxable as ordinary income |
| **Housing allowance designation (IRC 107)** | Amount designated as housing — must be prospective (before the tax year). Tax-free. |
| **Retirement plan contributions** | 403(b)(9) employer contributions, 457(b), 457(f) deferred comp |
| **Church-owned assets used by minister** | Parsonage, vehicles, technology, travel — committee approves each asset acquisition |
| **Discretionary spending authority** | Any church funds used for minister's benefit |
| **Total package value** | Sum of all above. Committee reviews total against comparables. |

### 7.4 Comparable Data Sources

| Source | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| Kenneth Copeland Ministries | $7M church-owned parsonage, private jets, extensive minister compensation. Survived Congressional investigation. |
| Joel Osteen / Lakewood Church | $10.5M residence, $200K+ salary, book revenue channeled through church |
| Creflo Dollar / World Changers | $2.5M residence, $69M Gulfstream (donor-funded) |
| National Association of Church Business Administration (NACBA) | Annual compensation survey by church size/revenue |
| Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) | Compensation benchmarks |
| ERI Nonprofit Compensation Database | Searchable salary data by role, org size, location |

**The comparable data justifies large packages.** If Copeland's church provides a $7M parsonage, Daniel's church providing a $500K-1M parsonage is conservative by comparison.

### 8.1 Bank Accounts

| Account | Signatories | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Operating Account** | Timothy Lawless (Treasurer) + Sydney Griffith (Comp Committee Chair, dual signature above $[10,000]) | Day-to-day ministry expenses |
| **PPA Distribution Account** | Timothy Lawless (Treasurer) + Nancy Courchesne (Secretary, dual signature) | Receives PPA distributions from LBS and LBC. Segregated from operating funds. |
| **Reserve / Investment Account** | Timothy Lawless (Treasurer) + Daniel Lawless + Sydney Griffith (any two of three) | Long-term reserves, investment of surplus funds |

### 8.2 Spending Authority

| Amount | Authorization Required |
|---|---|
| Under $5,000 | Senior Pastor alone |
| $5,000 - $50,000 | Senior Pastor + Timothy Lawless (Treasurer) |
| $50,000 - $250,000 | Spiritual Council majority vote |
| Over $250,000 | Spiritual Council supermajority (5 of 7) |

### 8.3 Asset Acquisition Process

For church-owned assets used by ministers (parsonage, vehicles, technology):

1. Senior Pastor proposes acquisition to Spiritual Council (doctrinal justification: ministry use)
2. Finance Committee reviews affordability and funding source
3. Compensation Committee reviews whether the asset constitutes part of minister compensation (it does — include in total package comparables analysis)
4. Spiritual Council votes to approve (family majority)
5. Asset titled in church name
6. Minister use documented (ministry purpose log)

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Daniel's PPA distributions (30% LBS + LBC) | ~$60,000 | ~$150,000 | ~$300,000 | Exempt — IRC 512(b)(2) |
| Jason's PPA distributions (10% LBS + LBC) | ~$20,000 | ~$50,000 | ~$100,000 | Exempt — IRC 512(b)(2) |
| Content license royalty (TE Holdings) | ~$10,000 | ~$30,000 | ~$75,000 | Exempt — IRC 512(b)(2) |
| Spiritual tech royalty (CI IBC) | ~$10,000 | ~$25,000 | ~$50,000 | Exempt — IRC 512(b)(2) |
| Tithes & donations | ~$10,000 | ~$50,000 | ~$100,000 | Exempt — donations |
| Conference/event revenue | ~$0 | ~$10,000 | ~$50,000 | Exempt if related to mission |
| **Total church revenue** | **~$110,000** | **~$315,000** | **~$675,000** | **100% tax-exempt** |

**This revenue base supports the minister compensation packages.** The Compensation Committee uses total church revenue as context when setting compensation — as revenue grows, compensation can grow proportionally.

|---|---|---|---|
| Panama PIF | None — excluded as beneficiary | Invisible | None |
| Panamanian Holdings S.A. | None | Invisible | None |
| TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) | None | Invisible | None |
| Light Brands Studio (Dubai) | Employee (executive role, salary) | **Visible as employee only** | None (no ownership, no directorship) |
| Light Brands Consulting (Cook Islands) | None | Invisible | None |
| **Church of the Living Light** | **Senior Pastor, Chairman, Founder** | **Visible — this is Daniel's entity** | **Total control via bylaws** |

**The church is Daniel's sole control point.** It is the only entity where Daniel has authority. All economic flows to Daniel come either from LBS (salary, for FEIE) or from the church (minister compensation). The church itself receives revenue from PPAs and royalties — contractual flows from entities Daniel does not own, direct, or control.

## 12. Who Daniel Needs to Appoint — Summary Checklist

### Immediate Appointments (Formation)

| # | Position | Person | Action Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Senior Pastor & Chairman** | **Daniel Lawless** | Named in founding bylaws |
| 2 | **Director of Worship & Community Life** | **Jennifer Lawless** | Named in founding bylaws as council member |
| 3 | **Director of Operations & Treasurer** | **Timothy Lawless** | Named in founding bylaws as council member |
| 4 | **Director of Outreach & Secretary** | **Nancy Courchesne** | Named in founding bylaws as council member. NOT on Compensation Committee (spousal attribution from Nicholas). |
| 5 | **Council Member, Compensation Committee** | **Iryna Voitenko** | Confirm availability and willingness to serve. Independence verified. |
| 6 | **Compensation Committee Chair** | **Sydney Griffith** | Named in founding bylaws as council member. Independence verified. Chairs Compensation Committee with Iryna + Angelina. |
| 7 | **Compensation Committee Member** | **Angelina Adelaide** | Confirm availability and willingness to serve. Independence verified. |

### Independence Requirements for Compensation Committee (Sydney + Iryna + Angelina)

All three Compensation Committee members must satisfy ALL of the following:

| Requirement | Sydney Griffith | Iryna Voitenko | Angelina Adelaide |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Not a family member of Daniel** | ✓ (not family — close friend) | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Not an employee of the church** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **No financial interest in Light Brands / TE entities** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **No financial interest affected by Daniel's compensation** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Willingness to serve genuinely** | Confirm | Confirm | Confirm |
| **Comfortable approving Copeland-scale compensation when supported by comparables** | Confirm | Confirm | Confirm |

**Nancy Courchesne** is NOT on the Compensation Committee. As the wife of Nicholas Courchesne (Light Brands co-founder with 30% PPAs in LBS/LBC), she is a disqualified person under IRC 4958 through spousal attribution. She serves the church in an operational role (Director of Outreach / Secretary) where her knowledge of the Courchesne family interest is valuable without creating any independence concerns.

### Formation Documents Needed

| # | Document | Prepared By | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Articles of Incorporation** | Religious nonprofit attorney | Critical |
| 2 | **Bylaws (with all protections from Section 11)** | Religious nonprofit attorney | Critical |
| 3 | **Statement of Faith** | Daniel + counsel | Critical |
| 4 | **Organizational Meeting Minutes** | Nancy Courchesne (Secretary) | Critical |
| 5 | **EIN Application (Form SS-4)** | Attorney or Daniel | Critical |
| 6 | **Compensation Committee Charter** | Attorney | Critical |
| 7 | **Initial Compensation Resolutions** | Compensation Committee | Before first tax year |
| 8 | **Housing Allowance Designation** | Compensation Committee | Before first tax year |
| 9 | **PPA Assignment Agreement (Daniel → Church)** | Attorney | With PPA execution |
| 10 | **PPA Assignment Agreement (Jason → Church)** | Attorney | If Jason chooses Option C/D |
| 11 | **Bank Account Opening Documents** | Timothy Lawless (Treasurer) | Within 30 days of EIN |
| 12 | **Church Audit Procedures Manual** | Internal | Month 2 |

---

## 13. Family Compensation — What's Defensible

Each family member receives compensation for their church role. The Compensation Committee (independents only) sets all compensation. Comparable data from churches of similar size supports the following ranges:

| Role | Y1 Range | Y3 Range | Y5 Range | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Jennifer Lawless** — Director of Worship & Community Life | $30,000-50,000 | $50,000-80,000 | $80,000-120,000 | Part-time→full-time as church grows. Comparable to worship directors at mid-size churches. |
| **Timothy Lawless** — Director of Operations & Treasurer | $40,000-60,000 | $60,000-100,000 | $100,000-150,000 | Operations/finance role. Comparable to church administrators. |
| **Nancy Courchesne** — Director of Outreach & Secretary | Voluntary / nominal | $30,000-50,000 | $50,000-80,000 | Non-Lawless-family director. Represents Courchesne family interest. Church compensation optional, set by Comp Committee. |
| **Sydney Griffith** — Compensation Committee Chair | Voluntary / nominal | $25,000-40,000 | $40,000-60,000 | Independent governance + Compensation Committee Chair. Scales as church grows. If compensated, set by Iryna + Angelina (Sydney recuses). |
| **Iryna Voitenko** — Compensation Committee | Voluntary / nominal | $20,000-35,000 | $35,000-55,000 | Independent governance + Compensation Committee. If compensated, set by Sydney + Angelina (Iryna recuses). |

**Key rules:**
- Each family member's compensation is set by the Compensation Committee (independents)
- Each must have genuine, documented ministry responsibilities
- Compensation must be reasonable for the role and church size
- Each family member recuses from votes on their own compensation
- Comparable data from NACBA salary surveys supports the ranges above

**Council members can also receive housing allowance (IRC 107) if ordained.** If Jennifer, Timothy, Nancy, Sydney, or Iryna become ordained ministers of the church, they qualify for tax-free housing allowance on the same basis as Daniel. This is a significant additional tax benefit. Counsel to advise on ordination requirements and timing.

## 14. IRS 14-Point Church Test

The IRS uses these 14 characteristics to determine church status. The Church of the Living Light must satisfy a majority (not all) of these:

| # | Characteristic | Church of the Living Light |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Distinct legal existence | Yes — incorporated with articles, bylaws, EIN |
| 2 | Recognized creed and statement of faith | Yes — Statement of Faith (spiritual wellness, healing, community) |
| 3 | Definite and distinct ecclesiastical government | Yes — Senior Pastor + Spiritual Council + committees |
| 4 | Formal code of doctrine and discipline | Yes — Statement of Faith + member covenant |
| 5 | Distinct religious history | Building from formation — document origin story and doctrinal development |
| 6 | Membership not associated with any other church | Yes — distinct membership |
| 7 | Organization of ordained ministers | Yes — Senior Pastor (Daniel) + Associate Pastor (Jason, if applicable) |
| 8 | Ordained ministers selected after completing prescribed studies | Yes — ordination program with curriculum |
| 9 | Literature of its own | Yes — spiritual wellness content, devotionals, educational materials |
| 10 | Established places of worship | Yes — can be home church, rented space, or digital ministry initially |
| 11 | Regular congregations | Yes — weekly services (in-person or digital) |
| 12 | Regular religious services | Yes — weekly worship, prayer, teaching |
| 13 | Sunday schools or equivalent for young | Future — educational programs as church grows |
| 14 | Schools for preparation of ministers | Future — training programs for ministry leaders |

**Meeting 10+ of 14 is generally sufficient.** The church satisfies at least 12 from formation.

**Red = hard bright lines** (violation directly triggers IRS exposure). **Orange = operational discipline** (violation weakens defense posture).

| Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---|---|
| **Compensation Committee must be 100% independent** | Loss of rebuttable presumption. Excess benefit risk. |
| **Compensation must be set BEFORE services rendered** | IRS can recharacterize retroactive pay as distributions. |
| **Housing allowance must be designated BEFORE the tax year** | Invalid designation = fully taxable. |
| **Church must maintain genuine charitable activity** | Cannot exist solely to benefit the founder. Must have programs, community service, charitable giving proportional to revenue. |
| **Council meeting minutes must be contemporaneous** | Minutes after-the-fact lose evidentiary value. Document in real-time. |
| **No private inurement** | Church revenue cannot be distributed to individuals as "profit." All compensation must be for services rendered. |
| **No circular cash flows** | Daniel donates to church → church pays Daniel back ≠ allowed. Church revenue from PPAs/royalties → church compensates Daniel for ministry ✓ allowed. The distinction: PPA revenue is the church's independent income, not recycled personal income. |
| **Church-owned assets must have ministry purpose documented** | Annual log of ministry use for each asset (parsonage, vehicles, tech, travel). |
| **Daniel must recuse from own compensation votes** | Cannot vote on or approve own compensation package. |
| **No Form 990 required — but keep records as if one were** | Internal financial records should be audit-ready even though no public filing is required. If the IRS ever invokes Church Audit Procedures Act, records must be available. |

**Two income channels to Daniel:** (1) LBS salary — foreign employer, qualifies for FEIE ($130K tax-free), and (2) Church minister compensation — salary, tax-free housing, tax-deferred retirement, church-owned assets. The church's income (PPAs + royalties) flows from entities Daniel does not own or control.

## 17. Agreement Architecture — Equity Without Equity

The church's economic power comes from contractual agreements, not ownership. Each agreement must be drafted to give the church **every economic right that equity would provide** — without a single share being issued. This is what makes the entire structure work: the church acts like a 30% (or 40%) shareholder in every way that matters, while legally holding zero equity.

**The church gets everything equity provides except the legal label.** That missing label is what eliminates CFC/GILTI, eliminates Form 5471, and preserves the PIF's asset protection layer. The agreements must be drafted so that no court, no IRS agent, and no counterparty can argue the church is being shortchanged — or that the arrangements are really "equity in disguise" for attribution purposes.

### 17.2 The 14 Bulletproof Principles

Every agreement the church enters — PPAs, license agreements, royalty agreements — must be built on these principles. Counsel should treat this as a checklist when drafting.

### 17.3 Principle-by-Principle Detail

#### Principle 1: Profit Participation

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Calculation** | Church receives X% of distributable profits, calculated identically to how equity distributions would be calculated |
| **Distribution frequency** | Quarterly, within 45 days of quarter end |
| **Distributable profit definition** | Net revenue minus operating expenses minus board-approved reserves. Same waterfall as equity: expenses → reserves → pro-rata distributions |
| **Currency** | USD or AED equivalent at prevailing rate |
| **Withholding** | Zero — no WHT on contractual payments from UAE or Cook Islands to US entity |

**Why this matters:** The church's revenue stream must be predictable and calculated on the same basis as if it held actual shares. Any deviation creates an argument that the PPA is "less than equity" — which could undermine the structure's purpose.

#### Principle 2: Exit Participation

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Trigger events** | Sale of entity, sale of substantially all assets, IPO/listing, merger, liquidation, wind-down |
| **Calculation** | Church receives X% of net exit proceeds (gross price minus transaction costs minus creditor payoffs) |
| **Timing** | Paid simultaneously with equity holders, from the same closing proceeds |
| **Escrow** | If exit includes escrow/holdback, church's share is held and released on the same terms as equity |
| **Earnout** | If exit includes earnout, church participates pro-rata on same terms |

**Why this matters:** Without exit participation, the PPA is just an income stream — it isn't equity-equivalent. Exit participation is what makes a 30% PPA worth the same as 30% equity. If LBS sells for $50M, the church receives $15M. Period.

#### Principle 3: Distribution Parity

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Timing** | PPA distributions paid at the same time as any equity distributions |
| **Priority** | PPA distributions rank pari passu (equal priority) with equity distributions — not junior, not senior |
| **No selective distributions** | Entity cannot distribute to equity holders while withholding from PPA holders, or vice versa |
| **Shortfall** | If distributable profits are insufficient to pay all holders in full, distributions are reduced pro-rata across all PPA and equity holders equally |

**Why this matters:** If the entity can pay equity first and PPA holders second, the PPA is subordinated — making it more like debt than equity. Parity ensures the church is treated as a co-owner in every economic sense.

#### Principle 4: Accumulation Account

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Tracks undistributed profits attributable to each PPA holder |
| **Calculation** | Each quarter: PPA holder's share of distributable profits minus actual distributions paid = net addition to accumulation account |
| **Exit relevance** | Accumulation account balance is included in exit valuation — church receives both its share of exit proceeds AND any undistributed accumulation balance |
| **Reporting** | Accumulation account balance reported to church quarterly |

**Why this matters:** If the entity retains earnings for growth (instead of distributing), the church's share of those retained earnings isn't lost — it accumulates and is paid out on exit. Without this, the entity could retain all earnings, grow in value, sell, and argue the church only gets a share of the sale price minus retained earnings. The accumulation account closes that gap.

#### Principle 5: Irrevocability

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Assignment** | Daniel's PPA is irrevocably assigned to the church. Cannot be reclaimed. |
| **Termination** | PPA cannot be terminated without the church's written consent |
| **Modification** | PPA terms cannot be modified to the church's detriment without the church's written consent |
| **Entity action** | Neither the entity, the PIF, nor Panamanian Holdings S.A. can unilaterally cancel the PPA |
| **Founder action** | Daniel cannot revoke the assignment, even if he leaves the church or ceases to be Senior Pastor |

**Why this matters for IRS:** The irrevocability is what makes the PPA assignment to the church legitimate. If Daniel could reclaim the PPA, the IRS would argue he still "owns" it (assignment of income doctrine). Irrevocability means the church — not Daniel — is the economic owner. Full stop.

#### Principle 6: Anti-Dilution

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **New equity** | Entity cannot issue new shares or equity interests without church's written consent |
| **New PPAs** | Entity cannot create new profit participation agreements without church's written consent (or pro-rata participation rights) |
| **Restructuring** | Any restructuring that would reduce the effective percentage of the church's PPA requires church consent |
| **Pre-emptive rights** | If new economic interests are created, church has the right to maintain its pro-rata share |

**Why this matters:** Without anti-dilution, the entity could issue new shares to a third party, diluting the church's 30% down to 15% or less. Anti-dilution ensures the church's economic interest is permanent and cannot be eroded by corporate actions.

#### Principle 7: Non-Subordination

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Debt** | Entity cannot incur new debt that takes priority over PPA distributions without church consent |
| **Management fees** | Entity cannot pay management fees or intercompany charges that reduce distributable profits below a reasonable threshold without church consent |
| **New investors** | Future investors cannot receive liquidation preferences that subordinate the church's PPA |
| **Contractual priority** | PPA distributions rank pari passu with equity distributions and senior to management/advisory fees |

**Why this matters:** A common way to undermine phantom equity is to load the entity with debt or management fees, reducing distributable profits to zero. Non-subordination prevents this — the church's distributions cannot be squeezed out by new obligations.

#### Principle 8: Change of Control Protection

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Sale of entity, merger, change of >50% of equity, change of board majority, sale of substantially all assets |
| **Effect** | Church's exit participation is triggered automatically — church receives its pro-rata share of proceeds |
| **Put right** | On certain trigger events (key person departure, material breach, prolonged non-distribution), church can demand buyout of PPA at fair market value |
| **Tag-along** | If PIF/S.A. sells its equity, church participates on same terms |
| **Drag-along** | If holders of 75%+ of PPAs approve a sale, all holders participate |

**Why this matters:** Without change of control protection, the PIF could sell the entity's shares to a buyer, pocket the proceeds at the PIF level, and argue the PPA holders have no claim on the sale. Change of control protection ensures the church always gets its exit proceeds regardless of how the sale is structured.

#### Principle 9: Audit Rights

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Annual audit** | Entity provides audited (or reviewed) financial statements within 90 days of fiscal year end |
| **Church audit right** | Church may engage its own auditor to examine entity books at church's expense, once per year, with 30 days notice |
| **Distribution verification** | Church may request detailed calculation of distributable profits and its share for any distribution period |
| **Records access** | Entity must maintain books and records and make them available for inspection on reasonable notice |

#### Principle 10: Information Rights

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Quarterly financials** | Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow — within 30 days of quarter end |
| **Annual budget** | Provided before start of fiscal year |
| **Material events** | Prompt notification of: litigation, regulatory action, key person departure, M&A activity, material contracts, debt incurrence |
| **Board materials** | Church representative (board seat or advisory board) receives all board materials |

#### Principle 11: Specific Performance

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Remedy** | Church may seek specific performance (court-ordered compliance) in addition to monetary damages |
| **Injunctive relief** | Church may seek injunctive relief to prevent entity from taking actions that violate the PPA |
| **Jurisdiction** | Disputes resolved in entity's jurisdiction: DIFC Courts (LBS/Dubai), Cook Islands courts (LBC), or by arbitration (LCIA/ICC) at neutral venue |
| **Acceleration** | If entity defaults on distributions for 2+ consecutive quarters, all accrued and future distributions accelerate and become immediately payable |

#### Principle 12: Survival

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Re-domiciliation** | If entity moves to a new jurisdiction, PPA follows — all terms survive |
| **Entity conversion** | If entity changes legal form (e.g., FZ-LLC to Ltd), PPA terms survive |
| **Restructuring** | If entity merges, spins off, or reorganizes, church's PPA attaches to the successor entity |
| **Dissolution** | If entity dissolves, church receives its pro-rata share of net assets after creditors |

#### Principle 13: Governance Rights

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Board representation** | Church holds one board seat on LBS (Dubai). Advisory board seat on LBC (Cook Islands, where nominee directors are required). |
| **Veto rights** | Church consent required for: sale/merger, new debt above threshold, related-party transactions, new PPA issuance, change of business, executive compensation above threshold |
| **Appointment** | Church's board representative is appointed by the Spiritual Council (Daniel as Senior Pastor nominates) |
| **Observer rights** | Church representative may attend all board meetings, even for matters not requiring PPA holder vote |

**Who sits on entity boards for the church?** The Spiritual Council appoints the church's representative. In practice, this will be Daniel (who serves on the LBS board as the church's appointee) or another council member. This is a governance role, not an ownership role — Daniel sits on the LBS board as a representative of a PPA holder, not as a shareholder.

#### Principle 14: Most-Favored-Nation

| Element | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | If entity grants any other PPA holder (current or future) more favorable terms on any provision |
| **Effect** | Church's PPA automatically receives the same improved terms |
| **Scope** | Covers all economic terms: distribution frequency, exit calculation, anti-dilution formulas, information rights, governance rights |
| **Notification** | Entity must notify church within 30 days of granting improved terms to any other party |

**Why this matters:** Prevents the church from being left with a weaker agreement if the entity later negotiates better terms with a new participant. The church's PPA is always at least as strong as the best PPA in existence.

### 17.4 Agreement-by-Agreement Summary

| Agreement | Counterparty | Church Gets | Key Principles | Governing Law |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Content License** | TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) | Ongoing royalty for spiritual content licensed to TE platform | Principles 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 (economic + enforcement) | Cayman Islands |
| **Spiritual Tech License** | Light Brands Consulting Ltd (Cook Islands) | Ongoing royalty for spiritual technology / methodology | Principles 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 (economic + enforcement) | Cook Islands |

### 17.5 The Assignment Mechanism

The PPAs don't originate with the church — they originate with Daniel (and Jason). The critical legal step is the **irrevocable assignment** from founder to church.

```

**Assignment agreement must include:**

| Clause | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Assignor** | Daniel Lawless (individual) |
| **Assignee** | Church of the Living Light, a 508(c)(1)(A) church |
| **Interest assigned** | 100% of Daniel's rights under the PPA — profit distributions, exit participation, governance rights, all ancillary rights |
| **Irrevocability** | Assignment is permanent and irrevocable. Assignor waives all right to reclaim, modify, or redirect the PPA. |
| **No retained interest** | Assignor retains zero economic or governance interest in the PPA after assignment. |
| **Consideration** | Assignment is a gift/donation to a tax-exempt church (charitable contribution — but Daniel should not claim a charitable deduction to avoid complexity; counsel to advise). |
| **Entity consent** | LBS, LBC, and Panamanian Holdings S.A. each consent to the assignment and agree to pay all distributions directly to the church. |
| **Effective date** | Assignment effective upon execution. All distributions from the effective date forward are the church's property. |
| **Survival** | Assignment survives Daniel's death, incapacity, departure from church, or any change in Daniel's relationship with the church. |

### 17.6 License Agreements — Church as IP Licensor

The church also earns revenue by licensing spiritual content and methodologies to TE entities. These are arm's-length license agreements, not PPAs.

| Agreement | What's Licensed | From | To | Royalty Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Content License** | Spiritual wellness content, devotional materials, faith-based curriculum created by the church's ministers | Church | TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) | % of revenue from products incorporating church content |
| **Spiritual Tech License** | Spiritual methodologies, healing frameworks, proprietary church practices | Church | LBC (Cook Islands) | % of consulting revenue derived from church methodologies |

**Key license terms:**
- License is exclusive to TE entities (they can't get it elsewhere)
- Royalty rate is arm's-length (comparable to content licensing in the wellness/spiritual space)
- Church retains all IP ownership — it licenses, not assigns
- License survives entity restructuring
- Church can audit royalty calculations
- License can be terminated by church if entity materially breaches

**Why arm's-length matters:** If the IRS reviews these agreements, the royalty rates must be justifiable by comparables. Too high → IRS argues it's disguised profit distribution. Too low → church is being shortchanged (private inurement argument reversed). Counsel should establish transfer pricing documentation for each license.

### 17.9 Questions for Counsel — Agreements

| # | Question | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Can the PPA assignment from Daniel to the church be structured as a gift without triggering gift tax? If the PPA has zero tax basis at assignment (no distributions received yet), is the gift tax value zero? | Critical |
| 2 | Should the church be a direct party to the PPA (three-party: entity + S.A. + church), or should the PPA remain bilateral (entity + Daniel) with a separate assignment agreement? Which structure is stronger? | Critical |
| 3 | Does DIFC law (Dubai) or Cook Islands law provide stronger enforcement mechanisms for PPA holders? Should we include parallel arbitration clauses? | Important |
| 4 | Can the church's PPA audit rights be exercised by the church's own accountant, or must it be an independent third-party auditor? | Important |
| 5 | If an entity restructures (e.g., LBS migrates from Dubai to another jurisdiction), what mechanism ensures the PPA survives without requiring a new agreement? | Important |
| 6 | For content/tech licenses: what comparable royalty rates in the wellness/spiritual content industry support the rates we set? Should we commission a transfer pricing study? | Important |
| 7 | Can the acceleration clause (default on 2+ quarters of distributions → all future amounts due immediately) be enforced in DIFC and Cook Islands courts? | Important |
| 8 | If the PIF or S.A. attempts to sell entity shares without triggering PPA change-of-control provisions, what legal remedies does the church have? Can we add a lien or security interest? | Forward |

## 19. Questions for Counsel (Church-Specific)

| # | Question | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Optimal state of incorporation for a 508(c)(1)(A) church with these governance protections? (Texas, Wyoming, Nevada, other?) | Critical |
| 2 | Can the Senior Pastor irremovability clause survive a state attorney general challenge? What language is strongest? | Critical |
| 3 | Can family members be ordained as ministers of the church and receive IRC 107 housing allowance? What ordination process is sufficient? | Important |
| 4 | Is there a maximum ratio of minister/family compensation to total church revenue that triggers IRS scrutiny? | Important |
| 5 | Should the church engage an independent auditor from Year 1, even though not required, to strengthen defense? | Important |
| 6 | Can the church hold real estate in multiple jurisdictions (US parsonage + Dubai property for international ministry)? | Forward |
| 7 | If the church receives PPA exit proceeds (entity sale), can those proceeds fund minister retirement plans or must they be retained as church assets? | Important |
| 8 | Review draft bylaws for compliance with state nonprofit corporation act and IRS requirements. | Critical |
| 9 | Nancy Courchesne (wife of Nicholas Courchesne, co-founder of Light Brands, 30% PPA holder) serves as Director/Secretary but is NOT on the Compensation Committee (excluded via IRC 4958 spousal attribution). Confirm this structure eliminates any independence concern. Does her role as Secretary (record-keeper for compensation decisions she doesn't vote on) create any issues? | Important |

*This document outlines a proposed governance structure for the Church of the Living Light modeled on Kenneth Copeland Ministries' 50+ year precedent. The bylaws framework provides maximum founder protection within the legal boundaries available to churches under the First Amendment and IRC 508(c)(1)(A). All governance provisions, bylaws, and compensation structures must be reviewed and finalized by a qualified religious nonprofit attorney before formation. Nothing in this document constitutes legal advice.*
