# PART I — LEAVING THE US

## 1. Current Situation

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Dan** | US citizen, planning to renounce |
| **Wife** | US citizen, planning to remain US citizen |
| **Net worth** | Under $2M (critical — see Section 2) |
| **Average annual tax (last 5 years)** | Under $190K (critical — see Section 2) |
| **Residence** | Currently abroad / planning abroad |
| **Income sources** | Light Brands entities (Studio + Consulting) |
| **Church plans** | Will establish internationally, NOT as US 508(c)(1)(a) |
| **Team** | 100% remote, developers worldwide |

---

## 2. Covered Expatriate Avoidance — The Window {#2-covered-expatriate-avoidance}

This is the single most time-sensitive decision. You must renounce **before** your net worth crosses $2M.

### What Triggers "Covered Expatriate" Status

You become a covered expatriate if **any one** of these is true on the date of renunciation:

| Test | Threshold | Your Status |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Net worth | > $2,000,000 | **Under — ACT NOW** |
| Average annual income tax (5 years) | > $190,000 (2026 inflation-adjusted) | **Under** |
| Failed to certify 5-year tax compliance | Failed to file all returns | **Must be compliant** |

### Why Covered Expatriate Status Is Catastrophic

If you are classified as a covered expatriate:

1. **Exit tax (mark-to-market):** IRS treats you as selling all worldwide assets the day before renunciation. Capital gains tax on unrealized gains (minus $866K exclusion).

2. **Permanent transfer tax on gifts to US persons:** Any gift or bequest FROM you TO any US citizen or resident (including your wife, children, future children) faces a **~40% transfer tax** on amounts exceeding $18K/year. **This never expires. Even if you regain citizenship.**

3. **Retirement account withholding:** 30% withholding on distributions from US retirement accounts.

### Why Avoiding It Matters for Your Wife

If you are NOT a covered expatriate:
- You can gift unlimited amounts to your wife with **zero tax consequences**
- You can fund her lifestyle, buy property together, transfer assets freely
- She reports gifts from a foreign person over $100K on Form 3520 (informational, not a tax)

If you ARE a covered expatriate:
- Every gift over $18K/year faces ~40% transfer tax
- A $100K gift costs ~$33K in tax
- This applies for **the rest of your life**

### The Action

| Step | Detail | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| Confirm net worth is under $2M | Include all worldwide assets: real estate, investments, business interests, crypto, retirement accounts | **This week** |
| Confirm 5-year tax compliance | All returns filed for 2021-2025. No late penalties or unfiled returns | **This week** |
| Engage US expat tax attorney | Model the exact numbers. Confirm no hidden assets that inflate net worth | **Week 1** |
| Obtain second citizenship FIRST | Grenada ($235-265K, 4-6 months) — cannot be stateless | **Months 1-6** |
| Renounce BEFORE net worth crosses $2M | If LB entities appreciate rapidly, the window closes | **Within 12 months** |

**The math is simple:** If your LB PPA interest (30% of LBS + LBC) becomes worth $2M+ at the time of renunciation, you're a covered expatriate. If LB is still pre-revenue or early revenue, the PPA's fair market value is minimal. **Every month of revenue growth narrows the window.**

---

## 3. Renunciation Timeline {#3-renunciation-timeline}

### Prerequisites (All Must Be Complete)

- [ ] Second citizenship in hand (Grenada passport)
- [ ] 5 years of US tax returns filed and current
- [ ] Net worth confirmed under $2M
- [ ] Average annual tax confirmed under $190K
- [ ] Wife understands and agrees to the plan
- [ ] Expat tax attorney engaged and has signed off

### The Process

```
MONTH 0:  Begin Grenada CBI application ($235-265K)
          Begin Paraguay residency ($8K, parallel track)
          Engage US expat tax attorney

MONTHS 1-6:  Grenada due diligence + processing
             Continue LB operations normally
             Prepare renunciation documents

MONTH 6-7:  Receive Grenada citizenship + passport
            YOU NOW HAVE A SECOND CITIZENSHIP

MONTH 7-8:  Schedule renunciation appointment at US embassy
            (San Jose, Costa Rica or wherever you are)

MONTH 8-9:  Attend appointment
            Complete forms: DS-4079, DS-4080, DS-4081, DS-4083
            Take oath of renunciation
            Pay $2,350 fee
            Surrender US passport

MONTH 9-15: File final US tax return (partial year)
            File Form 8854 (expatriation statement)
            Pay exit tax if applicable ($0 if under $2M)
            Receive Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN)

YOU ARE NO LONGER A US CITIZEN.
```

### After Renunciation

| Obligation | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Future US tax returns | **None** |
| FBAR | **None** |
| FATCA | **None** |
| Form 5471 | **None** |
| Worldwide income reporting | **None** |
| US tax on foreign income | **$0** |
| US tax on business income | **$0** |

Your only US tax obligation going forward: 30% withholding on US-source income (dividends from US companies, rental income from US property, etc.). If you have no US-source income, you owe nothing.

---

## 4. Wife Stays: Her Obligations and Income {#4-wife-stays}

Your wife remains a US citizen. The US taxes her worldwide income. Here's how to minimize it.

### Her Tax Obligations (Ongoing, Every Year)

| Filing | Required? | Detail |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Form 1040 | Yes | Annual US tax return |
| Form 2555 | Yes | FEIE claim ($130K exclusion on earned income) |
| FBAR (FinCEN 114) | Yes | Report foreign accounts > $10K aggregate |
| Form 8938 | Yes | Report foreign financial assets > $200K (overseas filer) |
| Form 3520 | If applicable | Report gifts from foreign persons (you) > $100K |
| Form 5471 | **Only if she owns 10%+ of a foreign corp** | See Section 14 |
| State tax return | Depends | If she maintains ties to a US state |

### FEIE Strategy (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion)

The FEIE excludes the first **$130,000** (2026) of earned income from federal tax if she:

1. Has a **tax home** in a foreign country (lives abroad), AND
2. Meets **either:**
   - **330-day test:** Present in a foreign country 330+ days in a 12-month period (can't spend more than 35 days in the US), OR
   - **Bona fide residence test:** Established genuine residence in a foreign country for a full calendar year

**Critical:** If she visits the US more than 35 days/year, the 330-day test fails. She'd need to qualify under the bona fide residence test instead (which is a facts-and-circumstances determination — more ambiguous).

### Her Income — Optimized

| Scenario | Salary | FEIE Exclusion | Taxable | Federal Tax | Effective Rate |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Conservative** | $130,000 | $130,000 | $0 | **$0** | **0%** |
| **Moderate** | $175,000 | $130,000 | $45,000 | ~$5,600 | **3.2%** |
| **Aggressive** | $250,000 | $130,000 | $120,000 | ~$21,400 | **8.6%** |

**Recommendation:** Set her salary at or near $130K to achieve **zero federal income tax**. Fund the household from your 0%-taxed income instead.

### Foreign Tax Credit Alternative

If she lives in a country with income tax (not Costa Rica/Panama), she can potentially use Foreign Tax Credits instead of FEIE. However, since the recommended residence countries (Costa Rica, Panama) have territorial tax systems that don't tax foreign income, FEIE is the better option.

---

## 5. The Marriage as Safety Net {#5-marriage-safety-net}

### Why She Should Stay a US Citizen

Her US citizenship is your permanent, unconditional door back to the US:

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Spousal petition (I-130)** | She can petition for you as an "immediate relative" — no visa caps, no backlog, fastest family-based pathway |
| **Timeline to green card** | 12-18 months from filing |
| **Timeline to citizenship** | ~4.5-5.5 years from filing (3 years residency + naturalization) |
| **Cost** | ~$5,700-$11,700 total |
| **Available when?** | Anytime — 1 year from now, 10 years from now, or never |

### Why Staying Married Is Superior to Divorce/Remarry

| Factor | Stay Married | Divorce + Remarry |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Immigration fraud risk | None | High — USCIS trained to spot pattern |
| Spousal petition available | Yes, anytime | Only after remarriage |
| USCIS scrutiny | Standard | Elevated |
| Criminal exposure | None | Potential federal charges |
| Timeline to green card | 12-18 months | 12-18 months AFTER remarriage + delays |
| Cost | ~$5-10K | $20-50K+ |

---

## 6. Gifts and Transfers Post-Renunciation {#6-gifts-and-transfers}

### If You Avoid Covered Expatriate Status (Net Worth < $2M)

| Transfer Type | Tax to You | Tax to Her | Reporting |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Cash gift to wife (any amount) | $0 | $0 (gifts are not income) | She files Form 3520 if > $100K from foreign person |
| Pay shared living expenses | $0 | $0 | None |
| Buy property together | $0 | $0 | Standard property reporting |
| Fund joint lifestyle | $0 | $0 | None |

**No limits. No transfer tax. Complete freedom.**

### If You Become a Covered Expatriate (Net Worth > $2M)

| Transfer Type | Tax | Impact |
|---------------|-----|--------|
| Gift to wife > $18K/year | ~40% transfer tax | $100K gift costs ~$33K in tax |
| Bequest (at death) | ~40% estate tax | Applies to entire estate left to US persons |
| Duration | **Permanent** | Never expires, even if you regain citizenship |

**This is why Section 2 is the most important section in this document.**

---

## 7. Divorce Protections {#7-divorce-protections}

### What's Divisible in Divorce (Per Marriage Agreement)

| Asset | Owner | Divisible? | Notes |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Joint personal property | Both | Yes | Standard marital property |
| Joint bank accounts | Both | Yes | Standard |
| Her salary/income | Her | N/A | Hers regardless |
| Your PPA (30% LBS + LBC) | You (personally held) | **Yes** | This is your contractual right — subject to the marriage agreement |
| Panama PIF assets | PIF (independent legal person) | **Protected** | PIF is not your property. Panama does not recognize foreign judgments against PIFs |
| Panamanian Holdings S.A. | Owned by PIF | **Protected** | Same — PIF layer protects |
| CI IBC assets/revenue | Owned by S.A. (owned by PIF) | **Protected** | Three layers of separation |
| Her PPA (if she has one) | Her | N/A | Hers regardless — independent contractual right |

### Key Protection: The PIF

The Panama PIF is an independent legal person under Law 25 of 1995. It has no "owner." Assets transferred to the PIF are legally separate from your personal estate. Panama:

- Does **not** recognize foreign divorce judgments against PIFs
- Requires creditors (including divorce claimants) to litigate in Panama under Panamanian law
- Protects beneficiary identities (private regulations)

**Your PPA is the vulnerability.** Without the church holding it, the PPA is your personal asset. Options to protect it:

1. **Assign the PPA to the PIF** — distributions flow through the PIF (0% tax post-renunciation), protected by Panama asset protection
2. **Structure the PPA through the S.A.** — add a contractual layer
3. **Accept the exposure** — the PPA generates income, and the marriage agreement covers it

### Her Independent Income Stream

If she holds her own PPA (even a small one — 5%) or has an employment contract with the LB entity, she has income that is **independent of the marriage.** This protects her and gives her security regardless of the marriage status.

# PART II — SIMPLIFIED LIGHT BRANDS STRUCTURE

## 8. Why the Current Structure Is Over-Engineered {#8-why-simplify}

The current Light Brands architecture was designed around specific constraints that **no longer apply** once you renounce US citizenship:

| Current Constraint | Why It Existed | Status Post-Renunciation |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| FEIE requirement (330 days abroad) | Shelter $130K of UAE salary from US tax | **Irrelevant** — you're not a US person |
| Dubai Golden Visa | Needed for FEIE bona fide residence | **Unnecessary for tax** — get residency wherever you want |
| Dubai Studio FZ-LLC (QFZP) | Employs team for substance + 0% QFZP tax | **Unnecessary** — CI IBC is already 0% with no substance requirement |
| Shared service center model (Studio builds for both TE + LB) | DEMPE substance for TE Holdings IP + QFZP qualification | **LB doesn't need TE's structure** if LB operates independently |
| CFC/GILTI avoidance | US founder can't own foreign corporations | **Irrelevant** — you're not a US person |
| Form 5471 avoidance | $10K penalty for non-filing of foreign corp ownership | **Irrelevant** — no US filing obligations |
| Church-held PPA | Sheltered PPA income from US tax | **Irrelevant** — your income isn't US-taxable |

**Every piece of complexity in the current LB structure exists to navigate the US tax code.** Remove the US citizen, remove the complexity.

### What Dubai Costs vs. What It Provides (For LB Only)

| Dubai Studio (Current) | Cost/Effort |
|------------------------|-------------|
| DIC trade license | ~$11-16K setup + ~$8-12K/yr renewal |
| Office space (mandatory for FZ-LLC) | ~$12-24K/yr |
| Employment visas for team | ~$3-5K per person |
| QFZP annual audit | ~$5-10K/yr |
| QFZP compliance filing | ~$3-5K/yr |
| Annual bookkeeping | ~$5-10K/yr |
| **Total Dubai overhead** | **~$35-65K/yr + ~$15K setup** |

**For a 100% remote team with no US tax constraints, this is pure overhead.**

### Three Entities. That's It.

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Tax | Purpose | Annual Cost |
|--------|-------------|-----|---------|-------------|
| **Panama PIF** | Panama | 0% | Ownership, asset protection, beneficiary distributions | ~$2-4K/yr |
| **Panamanian Holdings S.A.** | Panama | 0% (territorial) | Holds CI IBC equity, operational banking, contractor payments | ~$2-4K/yr |
| **Light Brands Ltd** | Cook Islands | 0% (unconditional) | Revenue, IP, client contracts | ~$3-5K/yr |
| **Total** | | | | **~$7-13K/yr** |

**Compare to current structure:** PIF + S.A. + Dubai Studio + CI IBC = ~$45-80K/yr in entity maintenance alone.

**Savings: ~$35-70K/yr in overhead.**

### Why One CI IBC Instead of Two

The current structure splits LB into two entities: LB Consulting (CI IBC, client-facing) and LB Studio (Dubai FZ-LLC, builds everything). This existed because Dubai needed to employ the team for QFZP substance.

With a 100% remote contractor model:
- No team to "employ" → no need for Studio as an employer
- CI IBC can pay contractors directly → no need for a service center
- One entity signs contracts, owns IP, collects revenue, pays contractors

If consulting revenue and SaaS/product revenue need separate tracking (for PPA calculations or liability isolation), use **internal revenue streams** within one entity rather than maintaining two separate entities with their own compliance, banking, and overhead.

**Exception:** If you want liability isolation between consulting and SaaS (so a consulting client dispute can't reach SaaS revenue), keep two CI IBCs. The marginal cost is ~$3-5K/yr — worth it if the businesses are meaningfully different.

---

## 10. Remote Team Management {#10-remote-team}

### Contractor Model

All team members are independent contractors, not employees. The CI IBC has zero employees by design.

| Method | Best For | How It Works |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Direct contractor agreements** | Senior developers, specialists, long-term team | CI IBC signs contractor agreement directly. Contractor invoices monthly. CI IBC pays via bank transfer or Wise |
| **Deel / Remote (EOR)** | Team members in countries with strict labor laws (EU, Brazil, etc.) | Deel legally employs the person in their country. CI IBC pays Deel. Deel handles payroll, benefits, taxes, compliance. ~$500-700/month per person |
| **Deel / Remote (Contractor)** | Contractors who want simple payment processing | Deel manages contracts and payments. ~$49/month per person |

### Permanent Establishment Risk

The main risk with remote contractors: if a contractor in a specific country works exclusively for the CI IBC, that country could argue the CI IBC has a **permanent establishment** (PE) there, subjecting CI IBC profits to that country's tax.

**Mitigation:**

| Strategy | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Use EOR (Deel/Remote) for high-risk countries | EOR is the legal employer — the CI IBC has no PE |
| Ensure contractors are genuinely independent | Multiple clients, own equipment, flexible schedule, not integrated into CI IBC's org |
| Avoid concentration | Don't have 80% of your team in one country |
| No physical office anywhere | The CI IBC has no office — contractors work from home/coworking |
| Board decisions made in Cook Islands (nominee director) | Governance/management not in any contractor's country |

### Recommended Team Structure

```
Light Brands Ltd (CI IBC)
    │
    ├── Dan (contractor/director) — Costa Rica or Panama
    │
    ├── Wife (contractor) — same location as Dan
    │
    ├── Senior developers (direct contracts)
    │   └── Paid via CI IBC Singapore bank → Wise
    │
    ├── EU-based team (via Deel EOR)
    │   └── Deel employs them locally, CI IBC pays Deel
    │
    └── Other contractors (via Deel Contractor or direct)
        └── Global, flexible
```

---

## 11. Banking and Payments {#11-banking}

### Primary Banking: Singapore

CI IBCs are well-accepted by Singapore banks. Recommended setup:

| Account | Bank | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **CI IBC primary** | DBS / OCBC / Statrys (Singapore) | Client revenue collection, contractor payments |
| **S.A. operational** | Banco General / Banistmo (Panama) | Backup banking, Panama-based payments |
| **PIF account** | Singapore or Panama | Distributions to beneficiaries |

### Payment Processing

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Stripe** (connected to Singapore bank) | SaaS subscriptions, recurring billing, online sales |
| **Wise Business** | International contractor payments (best FX rates), multi-currency receiving |
| **Direct bank transfer** | Large consulting engagements, enterprise clients |
| **Deel** | Contractor and EOR payments (handles FX, compliance, tax docs) |

### Revenue Flow

```
Client pays invoice
    │
    ▼
Light Brands Ltd (CI IBC) — Singapore bank — 0% tax
    │
    ├── Pay contractors (via Wise or Deel)
    ├── Pay SaaS/infra costs (Stripe fees, AWS, etc.)
    ├── Retain profit
    │
    ▼
Distribute to S.A. (dividends, 0% WHT from CI)
    │
    ▼
Distribute to PIF (dividends, 0% Panama territorial)
    │
    ▼
Distribute to Dan (beneficiary distribution, 0% WHT)
    │
    ▼
Dan receives in Costa Rica/Panama — 0% personal tax (territorial)
```

**Total tax on this entire chain: $0**

---

## 12. IP Ownership {#12-ip-ownership}

### How IP Gets Created and Owned

```
Contractor builds software/framework/product
    │
    ▼
IP assigned to Light Brands Ltd (CI IBC)
via contractor agreement IP assignment clause
    │
    ▼
CI IBC owns all IP — can license, sell, distribute
```

**Key contract clauses for every contractor agreement:**

1. **Work-for-hire / IP assignment:** All work product and IP created during the engagement belongs to Light Brands Ltd
2. **Pre-existing IP exclusion:** Contractor retains their own pre-existing tools/frameworks (specifically enumerated)
3. **Moral rights waiver:** Where applicable (varies by jurisdiction)

**No separate IP entity needed.** The CI IBC owns the IP directly. There's no need for a Delaware IPCo or separate holding entity — that structure was only useful for treaty routing from Mexico (REFIPRE avoidance). LB has no Mexican operations.

---

## 13. How Dan Gets Paid {#13-dan-compensation}

Post-renunciation, Dan has three channels, all at 0%:

### Channel 1: Contractor/Director Fee from CI IBC

## 14. How Wife Gets Paid {#14-wife-compensation}

She is a US citizen. The US taxes her worldwide income. Strategy: keep her earned income at or below the FEIE threshold.

### Recommended Structure

| Income Source | Amount | Tax Treatment |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| **Contractor fee from CI IBC** | $130,000/yr | Fully excluded by FEIE (Form 2555) |
| **Her own PPA (optional, 5%)** | ~$10,000 → $65,000/yr (growing) | Taxed at marginal rate (10-22%) |
| **Gifts from Dan (post-renunciation)** | Unlimited (if not covered expatriate) | Not income. Report on Form 3520 if > $100K |

### Her Tax at $130K Salary Only

| Filing | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Gross income | $130,000 |
| FEIE exclusion | ($130,000) |
| Taxable income | **$0** |
| Federal tax | **$0** |
| State tax | **$0** (if no state ties) |

**If she also has PPA income:**

| Scenario | Salary | PPA Income | Total | FEIE | Taxable | Tax | Rate |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|------|---------|-----|------|
| Y1 | $130,000 | $10,000 | $140,000 | $130,000 | $10,000 | ~$1,000 | 0.7% |
| Y3 | $130,000 | $33,000 | $163,000 | $130,000 | $33,000 | ~$3,700 | 2.3% |
| Y5 | $130,000 | $65,000 | $195,000 | $130,000 | $65,000 | ~$7,400 | 3.8% |

### Should She Own Equity in the CI IBC?

**No.** If she owns 10%+ of a foreign corporation, she must file Form 5471 annually ($10K penalty for non-filing). If she plus other US persons own >50%, it becomes a CFC with GILTI/Subpart F inclusions.

**Keep her as a contractor only.** No equity, no Form 5471, no CFC risk. She can hold a PPA (contractual right, not equity) if counsel confirms PPAs don't trigger Form 5471 for US persons. This is the same analysis from the current structure — PPAs are contractual, not equity.

### Critical: Wife Must NOT Be a PIF Beneficiary

She is a US citizen. If she is named as a PIF beneficiary:
- The IRS may argue she has a beneficial interest in a foreign trust/entity
- Potential Form 3520-A reporting (foreign trust)
- Potential CFC attribution issues
- Complex, expensive compliance

**Keep her completely outside the ownership structure.** She gets money through: (1) her contractor fee, (2) her PPA, and (3) gifts from Dan.

## 15. PPA Adjustments {#15-ppa-adjustments}

### Current PPA Structure (Four Founders)

| Founder | LBS Share | LBC Share |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Daniel Lawless | 30% | 30% |
| Nicholas Courschesne | 30% | 30% |
| Andreas Demou | 30% | 30% |
| Jason Sparks | 10% | 10% |

### Simplified PPA (Single Entity)

If LBS and LBC merge into a single **Light Brands Ltd** (CI IBC):

| PPA Holder | Share of Light Brands Ltd Profits |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Daniel Lawless | 30% |
| Nicholas Courschesne | 30% |
| Andreas Demou | 30% |
| Jason Sparks | 10% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

The PPA mechanics remain identical — quarterly distributions based on distributable profit. The simplification is that there's one profit pool instead of two.

### Dan's PPA: Personal vs. PIF-Held

| Option | Tax | Asset Protection | Divorce Exposure |
|--------|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Hold PPA personally | 0% (post-renunciation) | Low — personal asset | High — divisible per marriage agreement |
| Assign PPA to PIF | 0% (PIF distributes to Dan) | Maximum — PIF protected | Low — PIF is independent legal person |

**Recommendation:** Assign the PPA to the PIF. The economics are identical (0% either way), but the PIF provides asset protection and divorce insulation. The PIF's Foundation Council manages the PPA interest and distributes to Dan as beneficiary.

### Wife's PPA (Optional)

If the wife holds a small PPA (5%), it would be carved from Dan's 30%:

| PPA Holder | Share |
|------------|-------|
| Daniel Lawless (via PIF) | 25% |
| Wife (personal) | 5% |
| Nicholas | 30% |
| Andreas | 30% |
| Jason | 10% |

This gives her independent income that survives divorce.

## 18. Open Questions for Counsel {#18-open-questions}

### Critical (Before Formation)

1. **PPA and Form 5471 for wife:** If wife holds a 5% PPA in the CI IBC, does the IRS treat the PPA as "ownership" requiring Form 5471? PPAs are contractual, not equity — but confirm.

2. **Covered expatriate net worth calculation:** Does Dan's 30% PPA interest in LB count toward the $2M threshold? If so, what is the FMV of a 30% PPA in a pre-revenue / early-revenue company?

3. **PIF beneficiary and wife's US tax:** Confirm that Dan being a PIF beneficiary post-renunciation creates zero US tax exposure for wife (she is NOT a beneficiary).

4. **Gifts from covered vs. non-covered expatriate:** Confirm the exact mechanics of Form 3520 reporting for gifts from Dan (non-US person) to wife (US person). Any dollar limits?

5. **CI IBC PE risk:** With contractors in multiple countries, what specific measures prevent PE creation? Is Deel/Remote sufficient?

6. **Single CI IBC vs. two:** Any legal/tax reason to maintain separate LBC and LBS entities? Or is one CI IBC with internal revenue streams cleaner?

### Important (During Formation)

7. **Panama S.A. as payment agent:** Can the S.A. make contractor payments on behalf of the CI IBC without creating substance/PE issues in Panama?

8. **Singapore banking for CI IBC:** Which banks currently accept CI IBCs with Panama PIF ultimate ownership? DBS, OCBC, Statrys?

9. **Wife's FEIE and contractor classification:** Does wife working as a contractor (not employee) of the CI IBC qualify for FEIE? FEIE requires "earned income" — contractor income qualifies if it's for services performed.

10. **PPA assignment to PIF:** What are the mechanics of assigning Dan's PPA interest to the PIF? Does this create any gift tax or transfer tax event? (Should be none — Dan is transferring to a PIF he's a beneficiary of.)

*This document describes a legal tax optimization strategy combining US citizenship renunciation, Cook Islands IBC tax neutrality, Panama PIF asset protection, and FEIE for the remaining US citizen spouse. All mechanisms cited are explicit provisions of the relevant tax codes. Implementation requires validation by qualified US expat tax counsel, Cook Islands registered agent, Panama PIF counsel, and immigration attorney. The religious organization is planned for international establishment and is not part of this tax structure. This is not legal or tax advice.*
