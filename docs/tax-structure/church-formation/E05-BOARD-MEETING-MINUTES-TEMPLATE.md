## Purpose

This template provides the standard format for recording the minutes of the Spiritual Council (Board of Directors) of the Church of the Living Light. Consistent, contemporaneous documentation of all Council proceedings is essential for governance integrity and IRS compliance.

### CRITICAL: Contemporaneous Documentation

Section 15 of the Governing Framework establishes the bright line:

> **"Meeting minutes are contemporaneous — Real-time documentation. Not after-the-fact."**

Minutes must be drafted **during the meeting itself** or immediately thereafter. After-the-fact reconstruction of minutes weakens every governance action taken at the meeting, undermines the rebuttable presumption for any compensation decision reported, and creates vulnerability in any IRS examination.

The Secretary (Nancy Courchesne) — or her designee — shall take notes in real time during every Council meeting and prepare the formal minutes within **fourteen (14) days** of the meeting.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Contemporaneous documentation standard:** Confirm that the 14-day preparation window satisfies the contemporaneous documentation requirement referenced in Section 15 of the Governing Framework and 26 CFR 53.4958-6(b)(3).
2. **Executive session minutes:** Should executive session minutes be maintained separately from the general minutes? What level of detail should be recorded for executive session proceedings? How should executive session minutes be secured?
3. **Remote participation documentation:** Is the current attendance format sufficient to document remote participation for quorum purposes? Should the template include a statement confirming that remote participants could hear and be heard?
4. **Electronic distribution:** Can minutes be distributed electronically (email, secure portal), or should physical copies be provided? What constitutes adequate distribution under the state of incorporation's nonprofit statute?
