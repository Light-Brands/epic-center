## Preamble

A church that cares only for its ministers' present needs and ignores their future has misunderstood stewardship. The seventh generation begins with the first retirement contribution. What we set aside today becomes the foundation on which our ministers' later years are built — years that should be lived in dignity, in security, and in the continued warmth of the Light that called them to serve.

The retirement plan structure described in this document is not a financial optimization exercise. It is a moral commitment. The Church of the Living Light will provide its ministers with retirement security that matches the depth of their service. The tax advantages available to church retirement plans are not loopholes — they are the law's recognition that those who dedicate their lives to spiritual service deserve exceptional provision.

Three retirement vehicles, layered together, create a structure that no secular employer can replicate. The 403(b)(9) church retirement income account. The 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. The 457(f) ineligible deferred compensation plan. Together, they allow the Church to defer compensation far beyond what any corporate 401(k) could achieve — and, in the case of the 403(b)(9), to provide distributions that may be **tax-free for life** when designated as housing allowance in retirement.

This is the architecture of sacred provision.

## PART I — THREE RETIREMENT PLAN VEHICLES

### Section 1. Overview

The Church of the Living Light shall establish and maintain three complementary retirement plan vehicles for its ministers and eligible employees:

| Vehicle | IRC Reference | Annual Limit (2025) | Tax Treatment | ERISA Status | Key Feature |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **403(b)(9)** | IRC 403(b)(9) | Up to $70,000/year (employee + employer combined) | Tax-deferred contributions; distributions taxable unless designated as housing allowance | **Exempt from ERISA** (church plan) | Distributions can be designated as housing allowance in retirement = **TAX-FREE withdrawals for life** |
| **457(b)** | IRC 457(b) | $23,500/year (2025 limit) | Tax-deferred until distribution | **Exempt from ERISA** (church plan) | Stacks on top of 403(b)(9) — separate limit |
| **457(f)** | IRC 457(f) | **UNLIMITED** | Tax-deferred until vesting | **Exempt from ERISA** (church plan) | Must have substantial risk of forfeiture; no dollar cap on contributions |

### Section 2. The 403(b)(9) — Church Retirement Income Account

**What it is.** The 403(b)(9) is a retirement plan available exclusively to churches and church-controlled organizations. It is a subset of the broader 403(b) plan category, but Section 403(b)(9) specifically provides for "retirement income accounts" maintained by churches. It is the most powerful retirement vehicle available to church ministers.

**Contribution limits (2025).** The combined employee and employer contribution limit for 403(b) plans is the lesser of:

(a) $70,000 per year (combined employee elective deferrals + employer contributions); or

(b) 100% of the employee's includible compensation.

The employee elective deferral limit is $23,500 (2025). The employer may contribute additional amounts up to the combined $70,000 limit.

Ministers age 50+ may make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 (2025).

**Tax treatment of contributions.** All contributions are tax-deferred. The employee pays no current income tax on amounts contributed.

**Tax treatment of distributions — the critical feature.** For ordained ministers, distributions from a 403(b)(9) plan can be **designated as housing allowance** under IRC 107. This means:

(a) The distribution is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes;

(b) The exclusion applies to the extent the distribution is used for housing expenses (same limits as active housing allowance — actual housing costs, fair rental value);

(c) **This creates tax-free retirement income for life**, as long as the minister has housing expenses.

This is the single most valuable tax benefit available to church ministers. Contributions go in tax-free (deferred). Distributions come out tax-free (housing allowance). The result is **double tax avoidance** — a benefit unavailable in any secular retirement plan.

**ERISA exemption.** Church plans are exempt from ERISA under the church plan exemption. The Supreme Court confirmed this unanimously in **Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton, 581 U.S. 468 (2017)** — church plans include plans maintained by church-affiliated organizations, and the original establishment by a church is not required. The ERISA exemption means:

(a) No ERISA reporting requirements (Form 5500 not required);

(b) No ERISA fiduciary liability exposure;

(c) No ERISA funding requirements;

(d) No ERISA vesting schedule requirements (church sets its own);

(e) Simplified plan administration.

### Section 3. The 457(b) — Eligible Deferred Compensation

**What it is.** A 457(b) plan allows eligible employees of tax-exempt organizations (including churches) to defer additional compensation beyond the 403(b) limit. The 457(b) has its own separate contribution limit, which **stacks on top** of the 403(b) limit.

**Contribution limit (2025).** $23,500 per year. This is separate from and in addition to the 403(b)(9) limit.

Special catch-up: In the three years before normal retirement age, the limit doubles to $47,000 (2025).

**Tax treatment.** Contributions are tax-deferred. Distributions are taxable as ordinary income (no housing allowance designation available for 457(b) distributions — this benefit is unique to 403(b)(9)).

**Stacking effect.** A minister contributing the maximum to both plans defers:

| Plan | Employee Deferral | Employer Contribution | Total |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 403(b)(9) | $23,500 | Up to $46,500 | Up to $70,000 |
| 457(b) | $23,500 | — | $23,500 |
| **Combined** | **$47,000** | **Up to $46,500** | **Up to $93,500** |

**ERISA exemption.** Same as 403(b)(9) — church plans are ERISA-exempt.

### Section 4. The 457(f) — Ineligible Deferred Compensation (Unlimited)

**What it is.** A 457(f) plan is an "ineligible" deferred compensation arrangement — meaning it does not comply with the 457(b) limits. Because it is ineligible, it has **no statutory dollar cap**. The Church can contribute unlimited amounts.

**Contribution limit.** **None.** The Church may contribute any amount it can afford and the Compensation Committee deems reasonable as part of the total compensation package.

**Tax treatment.** Contributions are tax-deferred until the **substantial risk of forfeiture** lapses (i.e., until the benefit vests). Upon vesting, the full vested amount is taxable as ordinary income in the year of vesting.

**Substantial risk of forfeiture.** To maintain tax deferral, the 457(f) benefit must be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. This means the benefit must be conditioned on:

(a) **Continued service** — the minister must complete a specified period of service (e.g., 5 years, 10 years) before the benefit vests; or

(b) **Performance conditions** — the benefit vests upon achievement of specified ministry goals; or

(c) **A combination** of service and performance conditions.

If the minister leaves before the vesting condition is satisfied, the benefit is **forfeited** — it returns to the Church. This forfeiture risk is what creates the tax deferral.

**ERISA exemption.** Church plans are exempt from ERISA, including 457(f) plans. This is critically important because secular 457(f) plans are subject to ERISA's fiduciary, reporting, and funding requirements. The church plan exemption eliminates all of these.

**Design considerations.** The Compensation Committee, with counsel, shall design the 457(f) plan vesting schedule to:

(a) Create a genuine substantial risk of forfeiture (not merely nominal);

(b) Align vesting with the Church's long-term ministry goals;

(c) Provide meaningful retention incentive for key ministers;

(d) Be reasonable in light of the Church's revenue and comparable data.

## PART II — YEAR-BY-YEAR RETIREMENT PROJECTIONS

### Section 5. Cumulative Retirement Savings Projections

The following projections assume maximum or near-maximum contributions across all three vehicles, subject to Church revenue supporting the contributions and Compensation Committee approval. Actual amounts will be determined annually by the Compensation Committee.

| Year | 403(b)(9) Contribution | 457(b) Contribution | 457(f) Contribution | Cumulative Total (Simple) |
|------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Year 1** | $23,500 (employee deferral only — Church revenue limited) | $23,500 | $0 (established after revenue grows) | **$47,000** |
| **Year 2** | $35,000 (employee + partial employer) | $23,500 | $0 | **$105,500** |
| **Year 3** | $50,000 (employee + growing employer) | $23,500 | $50,000 (initial 457(f) contribution) | **$229,000** |
| **Year 4** | $60,000 | $23,500 | $75,000 | **$387,500** |
| **Year 5** | $70,000 (maximum) | $23,500 | $100,000 | **$581,000** |

**Notes on projections:**

(a) Year 1 assumes Church revenue of approximately $110,000; total compensation must be reasonable relative to revenue;

(b) Employer 403(b)(9) contributions increase as Church revenue grows;

(c) 457(f) contributions begin in Year 3 when Church revenue is projected at approximately $315,000;

(d) 457(f) contributions increase as revenue grows to approximately $675,000 by Year 5;

(e) These projections do not include investment returns — actual account values will be higher with positive returns;

(f) All contribution levels are subject to Compensation Committee approval following the rebuttable presumption process.

### Section 6. Long-Term Accumulation

| Year | Projected Cumulative Contributions | With 7% Annual Return (Estimated) |
|------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Year 5 | $581,000 | ~$650,000 |
| Year 10 | ~$1,500,000 | ~$2,100,000 |
| Year 15 | ~$2,500,000 | ~$4,200,000 |
| Year 20 | ~$3,500,000 | ~$7,200,000 |

**The 403(b)(9) housing allowance designation transforms these accumulations.** A minister retiring with $4M+ in a 403(b)(9) account who designates distributions as housing allowance receives **tax-free retirement income** — potentially $150,000-$200,000 per year, tax-free, for life.

## PART III — PLAN ESTABLISHMENT

### Section 7. Plan Establishment Steps

| Step | Action | Owner | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Engage church plan attorney** — experienced with 403(b)(9), 457(b), and 457(f) for church plans | Senior Pastor + Treasurer | Month 1 |
| 2 | **Select plan administrator** — church plan specialist (see Section 8) | Treasurer + Finance Committee | Month 1-2 |
| 3 | **Draft plan documents** — 403(b)(9) plan document and adoption agreement | Church plan attorney | Month 2-3 |
| 4 | **Draft 457(b) plan document** | Church plan attorney | Month 2-3 |
| 5 | **Compensation Committee approves contribution levels** — initial contributions as part of total compensation package determination | Compensation Committee | Before first tax year |
| 6 | **Execute plan documents** — adopted by Spiritual Council resolution | Spiritual Council | Month 3 |
| 7 | **Open plan investment accounts** — with selected custodian/administrator | Treasurer | Month 3-4 |
| 8 | **Enroll eligible employees** — provide plan summaries, enrollment forms, beneficiary designations | Treasurer | Month 3-4 |
| 9 | **Begin contributions** — first payroll deductions and employer contributions | Treasurer | With first payroll |
| 10 | **457(f) plan establishment** — deferred until Church revenue supports meaningful contributions (estimated Year 3) | Church plan attorney + Compensation Committee | Year 3 |

### Section 8. Plan Administrator Selection

The plan administrator should be a firm specializing in church retirement plans. Selection criteria:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Church plan expertise** | Must have specific experience with 403(b)(9) church retirement income accounts |
| **ERISA exemption knowledge** | Must understand and confirm the church plan ERISA exemption |
| **Housing allowance designation** | Must support designation of 403(b)(9) distributions as housing allowance in retirement |
| **457(b) and 457(f) capability** | Must be able to administer all three plan types |
| **Investment options** | Must offer a range of investment options (mutual funds, target-date funds, fixed income) |
| **Fees** | Competitive fee structure appropriate for the Church's plan size |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly statements, annual plan summary, online access |

**Recommended providers to evaluate:**

(a) GuideStone Financial Resources (Southern Baptist-affiliated; largest church retirement plan administrator);

(b) Envoy Financial (specializes in 403(b)(9) church plans; supports housing allowance designations in retirement);

(c) Brotherhood Mutual / Church Pension Group;

(d) MMBB Financial Services (American Baptist-affiliated);

(e) National church plan administrators recommended by counsel.

## PART IV — VESTING SCHEDULES

### Section 9. 403(b)(9) and 457(b) Vesting

(a) **Employee contributions** — immediately 100% vested (required by law);

(b) **Employer contributions (403(b)(9))** — the Church may set a vesting schedule for employer contributions. Recommended: 3-year cliff vesting (0% vested until 3 years of service, then 100% vested) or 5-year graded vesting (20% per year);

(c) **457(b)** — employee deferrals are immediately 100% vested.

### Section 10. 457(f) Vesting — Substantial Risk of Forfeiture

The 457(f) vesting schedule must create a genuine substantial risk of forfeiture. Recommended structures:

| Structure | Description | Forfeiture Risk |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Service-based cliff** | Benefit vests upon completion of [5 / 7 / 10] years of continuous service | If minister leaves before cliff, 100% forfeited |
| **Rolling cliff** | Each year's contribution vests [5] years after it is made | Staggered forfeiture creates ongoing retention incentive |
| **Performance-based** | Benefit vests upon achievement of specified ministry milestones (congregation size, program launch, revenue targets) | If milestones not achieved, benefit forfeited |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of service and performance — e.g., 5 years of service AND ministry program operational | Dual condition increases forfeiture risk |

**Counsel must design the vesting schedule.** The IRS scrutinizes 457(f) forfeiture provisions. A vesting condition that is virtually certain to be met (e.g., "continue breathing for 1 year") will be treated as not creating a substantial risk of forfeiture, and the entire benefit will be taxable immediately.

The vesting schedule should:

(a) Represent a genuine, non-trivial possibility of forfeiture;

(b) Be consistent with the Church's long-term ministry needs;

(c) Be documented in the plan document and the Compensation Committee resolution;

(d) Be reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee.

## PART V — TAX TREATMENT SUMMARY

### Section 11. Combined Tax Treatment

| Event | 403(b)(9) | 457(b) | 457(f) |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Contribution** | Tax-deferred (no current tax) | Tax-deferred (no current tax) | Tax-deferred until vesting |
| **Investment growth** | Tax-deferred | Tax-deferred | Tax-deferred until vesting |
| **Vesting** | N/A (contributions vest per schedule) | N/A (employee deferrals immediately vested) | **Taxable upon vesting** (entire vested amount included in income in year of vesting) |
| **Distribution (general)** | Taxable as ordinary income | Taxable as ordinary income | Already taxed at vesting; no additional tax on distribution |
| **Distribution (housing allowance)** | **TAX-FREE** if designated as housing allowance and used for housing expenses | Not eligible for housing allowance designation | Not eligible for housing allowance designation |

### Section 12. The 403(b)(9) Housing Allowance Advantage

The ability to designate 403(b)(9) distributions as housing allowance in retirement is the **single most significant tax benefit** in the Church's compensation architecture. To illustrate:

| Scenario | Secular 401(k) | Church 403(b)(9) |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Contribution | $70,000/year, tax-deferred | $70,000/year, tax-deferred |
| Growth | Tax-deferred | Tax-deferred |
| Distribution ($200,000/year in retirement) | Taxable as ordinary income — ~$40,000-$50,000 in federal tax | Designated as housing allowance — **$0 federal income tax** |
| Annual tax savings in retirement | $0 | **$40,000-$50,000** |
| Over 20 years of retirement | $0 | **$800,000-$1,000,000** |

This is not aggressive tax planning. This is the plain text of IRC 107 and IRC 403(b)(9), applied as Congress intended. The Church Audit Procedures Act (IRC 7611) ensures that the IRS can challenge this treatment only through the heightened church examination procedures.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **ERISA exemption confirmation:** Confirm that the Church of the Living Light, as a 508(c)(1)(A) church, satisfies the church plan exemption under ERISA 3(33) as interpreted by the Supreme Court in *Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton* (2017). Does the Church need to adopt a specific resolution affirming church plan status?
2. **457(f) forfeiture risk design:** What vesting conditions create a substantial risk of forfeiture that will withstand IRS scrutiny? Is a 5-year service cliff sufficient, or should the plan include performance conditions? What happens if the minister is terminated without cause before vesting — is the benefit forfeited or accelerated?
3. **403(b)(9) housing allowance in retirement:** Confirm that distributions from a 403(b)(9) church retirement income account can be designated as housing allowance under IRC 107 for retired ministers. What is the process for making this designation? Must it be done annually? Can the plan administrator handle the designation automatically?
4. **Contribution timing:** Can the Church make a lump-sum employer contribution to the 403(b)(9) at year-end, or must contributions be made on a payroll basis?
5. **457(f) funding:** Must the 457(f) be funded (assets set aside) or can it be an unfunded promise to pay? If unfunded, what protections does the minister have? If funded, does funding trigger current taxation?
6. **Plan document requirements:** What are the minimum requirements for the 403(b)(9) and 457(b) plan documents? Church plans have simplified requirements — but what must be included?
7. **Beneficiary designations:** What happens to plan benefits upon the death of the minister? Can the surviving spouse continue to receive distributions designated as housing allowance?
8. **State tax treatment:** Do all states follow the federal housing allowance exclusion for 403(b)(9) distributions? If the minister retires in a state that does not recognize the exclusion, what is the impact?
