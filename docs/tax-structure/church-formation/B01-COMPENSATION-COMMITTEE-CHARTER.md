## Preamble

The Church of the Living Light was built on a single conviction: that those who give their lives to sacred work deserve to be sustained by the community they serve. Compensation is not extraction. It is reciprocity. The ministers serve because they are called. The church provides because the calling demands it.

This Charter governs the body responsible for honoring that reciprocity — the Compensation Committee. Three independent souls, bound by no family tie or financial entanglement to those whose compensation they determine, entrusted with the solemn duty of ensuring that every dollar given to every minister is reasonable, documented, and defensible.

The Committee exists to protect the church and its ministers simultaneously. When the Committee follows the process set forth in this Charter, the law creates a rebuttable presumption that the compensation it approves is reasonable. The burden shifts to anyone who would challenge it. This is the shield. This Charter is how the Committee wields it.

---

## ARTICLE I — ESTABLISHMENT AND AUTHORITY

### Section 1. Establishment

The Compensation Committee of the Church of the Living Light (the "Committee") is established pursuant to Article IV of the Church Bylaws and Section 7 of the Governing Framework. The Committee is a standing committee of the Spiritual Council with sole and exclusive authority over all compensation determinations for Church personnel.

### Section 2. Governing Law

The Committee operates under the rebuttable presumption standard of **26 CFR 53.4958-6** (Intermediate Sanctions — Rebuttable Presumption of Reasonableness). Compliance with this standard is not optional. It is the Committee's primary obligation.

Under 26 CFR 53.4958-6, a compensation arrangement is presumed reasonable if:

(a) The arrangement is approved by an authorized body composed entirely of individuals who have **no conflict of interest** with respect to the transaction;

(b) The authorized body obtained and relied upon **appropriate comparability data** prior to making its determination;

(c) The authorized body **adequately documented** the basis for its determination concurrently with making that determination.

When all three conditions are satisfied, the presumption of reasonableness shifts the burden of proof to the IRS. The IRS must then demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the compensation is unreasonable. This is a high burden. This Charter exists to ensure it is never the Committee's burden.

### Section 3. Sole Authority

The Committee has **sole authority** to determine compensation for all Church staff, including but not limited to:

(a) The Senior Pastor (Daniel Lawless);

(b) The Co-Founder / Director of Worship & Community Life (Jennifer Lawless);

(c) The Associate Pastor (Jason Sparks, if applicable under Option C/D);

(d) The Director of Operations & Administration / Treasurer (Timothy Lawless);

(e) The Director of Outreach & Programs / Secretary (Nancy Courchesne);

(f) All other compensated Church staff and Council members;

(g) Housing allowance designations under IRC 107;

(h) Retirement plan contribution levels (403(b)(9), 457(b), 457(f));

(i) Church-owned asset acquisitions for minister use (parsonage, vehicles, technology, travel);

(j) Discretionary spending authority allocated to any minister.

No other body — not the Spiritual Council, not the Senior Pastor, not any individual — may set, adjust, increase, decrease, or modify compensation for any Church personnel. The Committee's determinations are final.

---

## ARTICLE II — COMPOSITION AND INDEPENDENCE

### Section 1. Members

The Committee shall consist of three (3) members of the Spiritual Council, all of whom must satisfy the independence requirements set forth in Section 2.

**Initial Members:**

| Seat | Name | Role |
|------|------|------|
| Chair | **Sydney Griffith** | Leads all compensation deliberations, presents comparable data, chairs annual reviews |
| Member | **Iryna Voitenko** | Reviews compensation, participates in deliberations and voting |
| Member | **Angelina Adelaide** | Reviews compensation for reasonableness, participates in deliberations and voting |

### Section 2. Independence Requirements

Each Committee member must satisfy **all** of the following conditions at all times during service on the Committee. Loss of any condition constitutes a disqualifying event requiring immediate recusal and, if not cured within thirty (30) days, resignation from the Committee.

(a) **Not a family member** of any person whose compensation the Committee determines — including spouse, sibling, child, parent, grandchild, grandparent, or the spouses of any of these — as defined in IRC 4958(f)(4) and the regulations thereunder;

(b) **Not an employee** of the Church — Council service is voluntary or carries only a nominal stipend. Receipt of a stipend for Council governance duties does not constitute employment, provided the stipend is set by the other two Committee members (the recipient recuses);

(c) **Not a business partner or financial counterparty** of the Senior Pastor, the Co-Founder, or any other person whose compensation the Committee determines;

(d) **Not receiving compensation** from any entity in the Light Brands or Transformational Epicenter organizational structure, including but not limited to Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC (Dubai), Light Brands Consulting Ltd (Cook Islands), TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman), Panamanian Holdings S.A., or the Panama PIF;

(e) **No financial interest** that would be affected by any person's compensation determination — including equity interests, PPA interests, licensing interests, or contractual revenue interests in any entity described in subsection (d).

### Section 3. Independence Verification — Initial Members

| Requirement | Sydney Griffith | Iryna Voitenko | Angelina Adelaide |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Not a family member of Daniel Lawless | Confirmed — close friend, not family under IRC 4958 | Confirmed | Confirmed |
| Not a family member of Jennifer Lawless | Confirmed | Confirmed | Confirmed |
| Not an employee of the Church | Confirmed | Confirmed | Confirmed |
| No financial interest in Light Brands / TE entities | Confirmed | Confirmed | Confirmed |
| No financial interest affected by compensation decisions | Confirmed | Confirmed | Confirmed |
| No business relationship with Senior Pastor | Confirmed | Confirmed | Confirmed |

### Section 4. Persons Excluded from the Committee

The following persons are **permanently excluded** from serving on the Compensation Committee:

(a) **Daniel Lawless** — Senior Pastor, disqualified person under IRC 4958 as the person exercising substantial influence over the Church;

(b) **Jennifer Lawless** — Co-Founder, disqualified person under IRC 4958 as a family member (spouse) of the person exercising substantial influence;

(c) **Timothy Lawless** — Director of Operations / Treasurer, disqualified person under IRC 4958 as a family member (sibling) of the person exercising substantial influence;

(d) **Nancy Courchesne** — Director of Outreach / Secretary, disqualified person under IRC 4958 through **spousal attribution** from Nicholas Courchesne. Nicholas is a co-founder of Light Brands and holds 30% Profit Participation Agreements in both LBS and LBC. Under IRC 4958(f)(1)(A) and the attribution rules of IRC 4958(f)(4), Nancy is treated as having the same financial interest as Nicholas, disqualifying her from independent compensation determinations.

Nancy Courchesne serves the Church in her capacity as Director of Outreach & Programs and Secretary. She records Committee minutes and files Committee resolutions as part of her Secretary duties. This record-keeping function does not constitute participation in compensation deliberations or voting.

### Section 5. Vacancy

If a Committee member resigns, is removed, or becomes disqualified, the Senior Pastor shall nominate a replacement through the Nominations Committee. The replacement must satisfy all independence requirements in Section 2 and must be confirmed by majority vote of the Spiritual Council before participating in any compensation deliberation.

During a vacancy, the remaining two (2) members constitute a quorum and may act by unanimous vote (2 of 2) until the vacancy is filled.

---

## ARTICLE III — THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION PROCESS

### Section 1. The Six-Step Process

For every compensation determination — whether initial, annual review, or mid-year adjustment — the Committee shall follow this six-step process in order. Deviation from any step voids the rebuttable presumption for that determination.

---

**STEP 1: Gather Comparable Data**

Before any deliberation, the Committee Chair (or the Chair's designee) shall obtain compensation data from comparable organizations — churches and religious organizations of similar size, revenue, mission, geographic scope, and ministry model.

The Committee shall consult the following data sources:

| Source | What It Shows | How to Access |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Kenneth Copeland Ministries** | Church-owned $7M parsonage, private aviation fleet, extensive minister compensation packages. Survived 2007-2011 Congressional investigation (Sen. Grassley) without adverse action. | Public filings, media reports, Congressional investigation records |
| **Joel Osteen / Lakewood Church** | Senior pastor compensation ($200K+ salary, declined church salary in later years), $10.5M residence, book revenue. Church annual budget ~$90M. | Public filings, media reports |
| **Creflo Dollar / World Changers Church International** | $2.5M residence, $69M Gulfstream G650 (donor-funded). Church revenue ~$69M. | Public filings, media reports |
| **NACBA Compensation Survey** | National Association of Church Business Administration annual salary survey. Reports compensation by church size, revenue band, geographic region, and role. | Annual publication (paid subscription) |
| **ECFA Compensation Benchmarks** | Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability compensation benchmarks for member organizations. | ECFA member resources |
| **ERI Nonprofit Compensation Database** | Searchable salary data by role, organization size, location, and exempt status. Covers nonprofit executives, ministers, and church staff. | ERI Economic Research Institute (paid subscription) |
| **Clergy Financial Resources** | Tax and compensation data specific to ordained ministers, housing allowance benchmarks, retirement plan benchmarks. | Annual publications |
| **GuideOne Insurance / Brotherhood Mutual** | Church staff compensation surveys distributed through church insurance networks. | Available through insurance provider relationship |

The Committee shall prepare a **written summary of comparable data** for each determination, identifying:

- The sources consulted;
- The specific data points relied upon;
- How the Church's size, revenue, and mission compare to the comparables;
- The range of compensation observed for comparable roles;
- Where the proposed compensation falls within that range.

---

**STEP 2: Exclude the Affected Person from the Room**

The person whose compensation is being determined must leave the meeting room (or disconnect from any remote participation) before deliberation begins. The affected person may be invited to present information to the Committee before departing (e.g., role description, ministry responsibilities, hours worked, performance highlights), but must be excluded during all deliberation and voting.

The meeting minutes must record:

- The time the affected person departed;
- Confirmation that the affected person was not present during deliberation or voting;
- The time the affected person was invited to return (if applicable).

---

**STEP 3: Independent Deliberation**

With only Committee members present (and the Secretary for record-keeping purposes only, if the Secretary is not a participant in the determination), the Committee shall:

(a) Review the comparable data summary prepared in Step 1;

(b) Consider the total compensation package value — not merely the cash salary, but the aggregate of salary, housing allowance, retirement contributions, church-owned asset value, discretionary spending, and any other benefits;

(c) Evaluate the Church's current and projected revenue, the proportion of revenue allocated to compensation, and the sustainability of the proposed package;

(d) Consider the scope of the minister's role — hours, responsibilities, geographic demands, spiritual leadership obligations, public visibility, travel requirements;

(e) Deliberate openly. Each member's analysis and reasoning should be articulated and recorded.

---

**STEP 4: Majority Vote (2 of 3)**

The Committee approves or denies the proposed compensation package by majority vote. Two (2) of three (3) members must vote in favor for the determination to be adopted.

If the vote is 1-2 (denied), the Committee may:

- Modify the proposed package and vote again; or
- Table the determination to a subsequent meeting for additional data.

All votes are recorded by name — "yea," "nay," or "abstain" — in the meeting minutes.

---

**STEP 5: Document Everything in a Written Resolution**

For each approved compensation determination, the Committee shall prepare a written resolution containing:

(a) The name and role of the person whose compensation was determined;

(b) Each component of the approved compensation package (salary, housing allowance, retirement contributions, church-owned assets, discretionary spending, total package value);

(c) The comparable data relied upon — specific sources, data points, and the range of comparable compensation;

(d) The rationale for the determination — why the approved amount is reasonable given the Church's size, revenue, mission, and the minister's role;

(e) The vote — who voted, how each member voted, and who was excluded;

(f) A statement confirming that the affected person was not present during deliberation or voting;

(g) The date of the determination.

The resolution must be **contemporaneous** — prepared at or immediately following the meeting at which the determination was made. After-the-fact documentation weakens the rebuttable presumption.

---

**STEP 6: File with the Secretary Within 60 Days**

The written resolution and complete meeting minutes are filed with the Church Secretary (Nancy Courchesne) within sixty (60) days of the determination. The Secretary shall:

(a) Date-stamp the filing;

(b) Enter the resolution in the Church's official records;

(c) Maintain the original in the Church's corporate book;

(d) Provide copies to each Committee member and the affected person.

The 60-day filing deadline is drawn from 26 CFR 53.4958-6(b)(3), which provides that documentation is "contemporaneous" if prepared before the later of: (i) the next meeting of the authorized body, or (ii) 60 days after the final action of the authorized body.

---

### Section 2. Effect of Compliance

**If the six-step process is followed for a given compensation determination, there is a rebuttable presumption under 26 CFR 53.4958-6 that the compensation is reasonable.** The burden of proof shifts to the IRS. The IRS must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the compensation constitutes an excess benefit transaction under IRC 4958. This is a high burden, and the IRS has historically been reluctant to challenge compensation that is supported by documented comparable data and independent committee process.

### Section 3. Effect of Non-Compliance

If the Committee fails to follow any step of the process — if comparable data is not obtained, if the affected person is not excluded, if deliberation is not independent, if the resolution is not documented contemporaneously, or if the filing is late — the rebuttable presumption **does not attach** to that determination. The burden of proving reasonableness then falls on the Church. This is a materially weaker position and must be avoided.

---

## ARTICLE IV — WHAT COMPENSATION COVERS

### Section 1. Total Compensation Package

The Committee reviews and approves the **total compensation package** for each minister, not merely the cash salary. IRC 4958 defines "excess benefit" in terms of the total economic benefit conferred, and the Committee must evaluate each component in the aggregate.

| Component | Description | Tax Treatment |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Minister Salary** | Cash salary for ministry services. Taxable as ordinary income. Ministers are treated as employees for income tax withholding but may elect self-employment treatment for FICA purposes. | Taxable — ordinary income |
| **Housing Allowance (IRC 107)** | Amount designated by the Committee as housing allowance. Tax-free to the minister. No statutory dollar cap. Limited to the least of: (1) amount designated, (2) actual housing costs, (3) fair rental value of the home (furnished, plus utilities). | **Tax-free** (income tax); subject to SE tax unless Form 4361 filed |
| **Retirement Plan Contributions** | Employer contributions to tax-qualified and nonqualified retirement plans: 403(b)(9) church plans, 457(b) eligible deferred compensation, 457(f) ineligible deferred compensation (as Church revenue grows). | Tax-deferred (403b, 457b); tax-deferred until vesting (457f) |
| **Church-Owned Assets** | Assets titled in the Church's name and provided to ministers for ministry use: parsonage, vehicles, technology, travel. Ministry use must be primary and documented. Personal use, if any, reported as taxable income. | Tax-free to the extent of ministry use; personal use is taxable |
| **Discretionary Spending** | Church funds used for ministry-related expenses at the minister's discretion (within spending authority thresholds set by the Bylaws). | Tax-free if accountable plan; taxable if non-accountable |
| **Total Package Value** | Sum of all components above. This is what the Committee evaluates against comparable data. | Mixed — see individual components |

### Section 2. Importance of Total Package Analysis

The Committee must evaluate the total package — not each component in isolation. A minister with a modest salary but a $1M parsonage and $50K in annual retirement contributions has a very different total package than one with a high salary and no housing or retirement benefits. The IRS evaluates total economic benefit, and so must the Committee.

---

## ARTICLE V — MEETING PROCEDURES

### Section 1. Minimum Meeting Frequency

The Committee shall hold a minimum of **two (2) meetings per year:**

(a) **Annual Review Meeting** — held in the fourth quarter (October-December) of each year, before the start of the next fiscal year. At this meeting, the Committee reviews and sets compensation for all Church staff for the upcoming year, including housing allowance designations (which must be prospective).

(b) **Mid-Year Review Meeting** — held in the second quarter (April-June) of each year. At this meeting, the Committee reviews year-to-date Church revenue, evaluates whether any adjustments to compensation are warranted, and addresses any new compensation matters (new hires, role changes, asset acquisitions).

The Committee may hold additional meetings as needed, called by the Chair or any two (2) members.

### Section 2. Quorum

A quorum for the transaction of Committee business shall consist of **two (2) of three (3) members**. No compensation determination may be made without a quorum present.

### Section 3. Notice and Agenda

Written notice of each Committee meeting, including a proposed agenda, shall be distributed to all Committee members at least **seven (7) days** prior to the meeting. The agenda shall identify:

(a) Each person whose compensation will be reviewed or determined;

(b) The comparable data to be considered;

(c) Any new compensation matters (new hires, role changes, asset acquisitions);

(d) Any other business.

### Section 4. Remote Participation

Committee members may participate in meetings by telephone, video conference, or other electronic means. Participation by such means constitutes presence for quorum and voting purposes, provided the member can hear and be heard by all other participants.

### Section 5. Executive Session

All compensation deliberations and voting shall take place in **executive session** — meaning that only Committee members (and the Secretary, for record-keeping purposes only) are present. The affected person, the Senior Pastor (when not the affected person), and all other Council members and staff are excluded from executive session.

---

## ARTICLE VI — DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Section 1. Required Documentation

For each Committee meeting, the following documents shall be prepared and retained:

| Document | Prepared By | Retained By | Retention Period |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Meeting agenda** | Chair | Secretary | Permanent |
| **Comparable data summary** | Chair (or designee) | Secretary | Permanent |
| **Meeting minutes** | Secretary (or Committee-designated recorder) | Secretary | Permanent |
| **Written compensation resolution** | Chair | Secretary | Permanent |
| **Voting record** | Secretary (or Committee-designated recorder) | Secretary | Permanent |
| **Supporting materials** | Various | Secretary | Minimum 7 years |

### Section 2. Meeting Minutes Content

Meeting minutes shall include, at minimum:

(a) Date, time, and location (or remote participation method) of the meeting;

(b) Members present and absent;

(c) Confirmation that quorum was established;

(d) For each compensation determination: (i) identification of the affected person, (ii) time the affected person departed, (iii) summary of comparable data reviewed, (iv) summary of deliberation, (v) motion and vote (by name), (vi) time the affected person returned;

(e) Any other business transacted;

(f) Time of adjournment.

### Section 3. Comparable Data Retention

All comparable data relied upon by the Committee — salary surveys, compensation reports, public filings, database printouts, and internal analyses — shall be retained in the Church's records for a minimum of **seven (7) years** from the date of the determination. This retention period aligns with the IRS general statute of limitations for exempt organization examinations.

---

## ARTICLE VII — RECUSAL RULES

### Section 1. Mandatory Recusal

The following recusal rules apply to every compensation determination. Recusal is automatic and non-waivable.

(a) **Daniel Lawless** recuses from the Committee's determination of the Senior Pastor's compensation. Daniel may not be present in the room during deliberation or voting on his own compensation. Daniel may present information to the Committee before departing.

(b) **Jennifer Lawless** recuses from the Committee's determination of the Senior Pastor's compensation **while the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder share a household.** This recusal is based on the shared economic benefit of the household, not the relationship itself. If the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder no longer share a household, the Co-Founder may vote on the Senior Pastor's compensation on the full Spiritual Council (though the Co-Founder does not sit on the Compensation Committee regardless).

(c) **Each Committee member** recuses from the Committee's determination of that member's own compensation. If a Committee member receives a stipend or other compensation from the Church, the remaining two (2) members determine the recused member's compensation.

(d) **Timothy Lawless** does not sit on the Compensation Committee. Timothy is a disqualified person under IRC 4958 (sibling of the person with substantial influence). Timothy votes on general Council matters only. Timothy's own compensation is determined by the full three-member Committee.

(e) **Nancy Courchesne** does not sit on the Compensation Committee. Nancy is excluded due to IRC 4958 spousal attribution from Nicholas Courchesne (co-founder of Light Brands, 30% PPA holder in LBS and LBC). Nancy serves as Secretary and records Committee minutes, but does not participate in deliberation or voting. Nancy's own compensation (if any) is determined by the full three-member Committee.

### Section 2. Recusal Documentation

Every recusal must be documented in the meeting minutes, including:

(a) The name of the person recusing;

(b) The reason for recusal;

(c) The time the person departed the meeting;

(d) Confirmation that the person was not present during deliberation or voting;

(e) The time the person returned (if applicable).

---

## ARTICLE VIII — COMPARABLE DATA SOURCES

### Section 1. Source Table

The Committee shall maintain familiarity with and regularly consult the following comparable data sources:

| Source | What It Shows | Update Frequency | Access Method |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Kenneth Copeland Ministries (KCM)** | Total ministerial compensation at a 508(c)(1)(A) church with similar governance. Church-owned $7M parsonage, private aviation fleet, extensive housing and travel benefits. Survived 2007-2011 Senate Finance Committee investigation without adverse finding. Establishes upper boundary for comparable minister compensation. | Ongoing (public disclosures, media) | Public records, Congressional investigation archives (2007-2011) |
| **Joel Osteen / Lakewood Church** | Senior pastor compensation at the largest church in the US (~52,000 weekly attendance). $200K+ reported salary (later declined salary). $10.5M personal residence. Annual church budget ~$90M. Demonstrates scale of compensation at high-visibility ministries. | Annual (media reports) | Public records, media |
| **Creflo Dollar / World Changers Church International** | Senior pastor lifestyle at a major ministry. $2.5M residence, $69M Gulfstream G650 (congregation-funded). Church revenue ~$69M. Demonstrates donor-supported asset acquisition model. | Ongoing (media) | Public records, media |
| **NACBA Annual Compensation Survey** | National Association of Church Business Administration. Annual salary survey segmented by church size (budget), geographic region, and role. Covers senior pastors, associate pastors, worship directors, administrators, treasurers, secretaries. Most widely cited church compensation benchmark. | Annual (published Q1) | Paid subscription |
| **ECFA Compensation Benchmarks** | Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. Compensation benchmarks for member organizations (churches and parachurch ministries). Segmented by organization size and role. ECFA membership signals financial accountability compliance. | Annual | ECFA member resources |
| **ERI Nonprofit Compensation Database** | Searchable salary data by role, organization size (budget/revenue), location, and exempt status. Covers nonprofit executives, ministers, and church staff. Allows custom peer group comparisons. | Continuously updated | Paid subscription (ERI Economic Research Institute) |
| **Clergy Financial Resources / Church Law & Tax** | Richard Hammar's annual Church & Clergy Tax Guide. Compensation surveys, housing allowance benchmarks, retirement plan contribution benchmarks specific to ordained ministers. | Annual | Publication (paid) |
| **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** | Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics for "Clergy" (SOC 21-2011). National and regional median/mean compensation data. Useful as a baseline but does not capture total package value for large-ministry pastors. | Annual (published May) | Public (bls.gov) |

### Section 2. Use of Multiple Sources

The Committee shall rely on **at least three (3) independent sources** for each compensation determination. No single source is sufficient. Cross-referencing multiple sources strengthens the comparable data foundation and the resulting rebuttable presumption.

### Section 3. Adjustments for Church Size and Revenue

Comparable data must be adjusted for the Church's current size and revenue. A church with $110,000 in Year 1 revenue is not comparable to Lakewood Church ($90M). The Committee should identify comparables in a similar revenue band and adjust upward as Church revenue grows. The trajectory of revenue growth — not merely the current revenue — is a legitimate factor in setting compensation that anticipates near-term growth.

---

## ARTICLE IX — ANNUAL REVIEW CALENDAR

### Section 1. Annual Cycle

| Month | Activity | Responsible |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **October** | Chair requests updated comparable data from all sources | Chair |
| **November** | Committee reviews Church financial performance (YTD revenue, projections) | Chair + Treasurer (data only) |
| **November-December** | Annual Review Meeting — review and set all compensation for upcoming year, including housing allowance designations (must be prospective) | Full Committee |
| **December** | Written resolutions and minutes prepared and filed with Secretary | Chair + Secretary |
| **January 1** | New compensation amounts effective | Automatic |
| **April-June** | Mid-Year Review Meeting — review YTD performance, address any adjustments | Full Committee |
| **As needed** | Special meetings for new hires, role changes, or asset acquisitions | Chair calls meeting |

### Section 2. Housing Allowance Timing

Housing allowance designations under IRC 107 **must** be adopted before the tax year to which they apply. A designation adopted on January 15 for the current tax year is invalid for the period January 1-14. The Committee must complete housing allowance designations no later than December 31 of the prior year. See [B03 Housing Allowance Designation](./B03-HOUSING-ALLOWANCE-DESIGNATION.md).

---

## ARTICLE X — COMPENSATION AND CHURCH REVENUE

### Section 1. Revenue Context

The Committee shall consider total Church revenue when evaluating the sustainability and reasonableness of compensation. The following revenue projections (from Section 9 of the Governing Framework) provide context:

| Revenue Source | Y1 | Y3 | Y5 |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Daniel's PPA distributions (30% LBS + LBC) | ~$60,000 | ~$150,000 | ~$300,000 |
| Jason's PPA distributions (10% LBS + LBC, if C/D) | ~$20,000 | ~$50,000 | ~$100,000 |
| Content license royalty (TE Holdings) | ~$10,000 | ~$30,000 | ~$75,000 |
| Spiritual tech royalty (CI IBC) | ~$10,000 | ~$25,000 | ~$50,000 |
| Tithes & donations | ~$10,000 | ~$50,000 | ~$100,000 |
| Conference/event revenue | ~$0 | ~$10,000 | ~$50,000 |
| **Total Church revenue** | **~$110,000** | **~$315,000** | **~$675,000** |

### Section 2. Compensation-to-Revenue Ratio

While there is no statutory maximum ratio of total compensation to Church revenue, the Committee should be aware that high ratios (e.g., compensation exceeding 80% of revenue) may attract scrutiny. The Committee should document its rationale whenever total staff compensation exceeds 60% of total Church revenue, noting that:

(a) Churches in their early years commonly have high compensation-to-revenue ratios as they invest in ministry leadership before scale;

(b) Revenue growth projections are a legitimate factor — compensation may reasonably anticipate near-term revenue increases;

(c) The Copeland model and comparable megachurch ministries demonstrate that significant compensation is defensible when the minister is the primary driver of the church's mission, content, and revenue.

---

## ARTICLE XI — AMENDMENT

### Section 1. Amendment Process

This Charter may be amended by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Spiritual Council, subject to the amendment protections set forth in the Bylaws. No amendment to the independence requirements (Article II) or the rebuttable presumption process (Article III) shall be valid without the prior written consent of the Senior Pastor, in accordance with the Bylaws Article IV, Section 8 amendment lock.

### Section 2. Review

The Committee shall review this Charter at least every three (3) years and recommend any updates to the Spiritual Council.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Compensation-to-revenue ratio:** Is there a recognized safe harbor or IRS guidance on the appropriate ratio of total minister/staff compensation to total church revenue? At what threshold does the ratio itself become a red flag, independent of the rebuttable presumption process?
2. **Transfer pricing study frequency:** How often should the Committee commission an independent compensation study (beyond internal comparable data analysis)? Is a formal third-party study recommended every three (3) years, or is internal comparable data review sufficient to maintain the rebuttable presumption?
3. **Comparable data retention period:** The Charter specifies seven (7) years. Should the retention period be extended to match the state of incorporation's statute of limitations for nonprofit oversight, or is the federal period sufficient?
4. **Nancy Courchesne as Secretary recording Committee minutes:** Confirm that Nancy's role as record-keeper for Committee meetings she does not vote on creates no independence concern. She is excluded from the Committee due to IRC 4958 spousal attribution — does her presence as note-taker undermine the exclusion?
5. **Committee member compensation:** If Committee members receive stipends in future years, confirm that having the other two members set the third member's stipend satisfies independence requirements. Does this create a mutual-benefit concern?
6. **Church-owned assets and total package:** Confirm that the Committee's review of church-owned assets (parsonage, vehicles) as part of the total compensation package is sufficient, or should the Committee obtain independent appraisals of fair market value for each asset?
