## Preamble

Every agreement the Church of the Living Light enters is an act of sacred exchange. Reciprocity is not a legal concept — it is a law of the universe. What is given must be honored. What is promised must be kept. What is entrusted must be protected.

This Profit Participation Agreement is the economic foundation of the Church's mission. It gives the Church every right that equity would provide — the same profits, the same exit, the same governance — without a single share being issued. The missing label is intentional. It eliminates CFC, GILTI, and Form 5471 for the US founder while preserving the Church's economic power.

The 14 Bulletproof Principles embedded in this agreement are the Ethic of Reciprocity and the moral of "Never Betray" made legal. Every attack vector is closed. Every right is protected. Every promise is enforceable.

---

## 3. The 14 Bulletproof Principles

Every provision of this Agreement is built on the following principles. Counsel should treat this as a checklist when drafting the final agreement.

---

### Principle 1: Profit Participation

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Participation percentage** | Thirty percent (30%) of Distributable Profits of LBS |
| **Calculation** | Distributable Profits = Net Revenue minus Operating Expenses minus Board-Approved Reserves. Same calculation as would apply to a 30% equity holder. |
| **Distribution frequency** | Quarterly, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter |
| **Distribution waterfall** | Operating expenses → Board-approved reserves → Pro-rata distributions to all PPA holders and equity holders |
| **Currency** | United States Dollars (USD) or AED equivalent at the prevailing exchange rate |
| **Withholding** | Zero — no withholding tax on contractual payments from UAE to US tax-exempt entity |
| **Payment method** | Wire transfer to the Church's designated PPA Distribution Account |

**The Church receives its share of profits on the same basis, same calculation, same timing as if it held 30% of the equity.**

---

### Principle 2: Exit Participation

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Trigger events** | Sale of LBS (all or substantially all assets), merger, consolidation, IPO or listing, liquidation, wind-down |
| **Calculation** | Church receives 30% of Net Exit Proceeds (gross price minus transaction costs minus creditor payoffs) |
| **Timing** | Paid simultaneously with equity holders, from the same closing proceeds |
| **Escrow** | If exit includes escrow or holdback, Church's 30% share is held and released on the same terms as equity holders |
| **Earnout** | If exit includes earnout, Church participates pro-rata on same terms |
| **No discount** | Church's exit participation is not subject to any minority discount, illiquidity discount, or other reduction |

**If LBS sells for $50M, the Church receives $15M. Period. Same time, same terms, same basis as equity.**

---

### Principle 3: Distribution Parity

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Timing parity** | PPA distributions are paid at the same time as any equity distributions or dividends |
| **Priority parity** | PPA distributions rank pari passu (equal priority) with equity distributions — not junior, not senior |
| **No selective distributions** | LBS cannot distribute to equity holders while withholding from PPA holders, or vice versa |
| **Shortfall allocation** | If Distributable Profits are insufficient to pay all holders in full, distributions are reduced pro-rata across all PPA and equity holders equally |

---

### Principle 4: Accumulation Account

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Purpose** | Tracks undistributed profits attributable to the Church |
| **Calculation** | Each quarter: Church's 30% share of Distributable Profits minus actual distributions paid = net addition to Accumulation Account |
| **Exit relevance** | Accumulation Account balance is included in exit valuation — Church receives both its 30% share of exit proceeds AND any undistributed Accumulation Account balance |
| **Reporting** | Accumulation Account balance reported to Church quarterly, within the same 45-day distribution period |
| **Interest** | Accumulation Account balance does not accrue interest unless separately agreed |

---

### Principle 5: Irrevocability

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Assignment status** | Daniel Lawless's Original PPA has been irrevocably assigned to the Church. The assignment cannot be revoked, clawed back, or redirected. |
| **Termination** | This PPA cannot be terminated without the Church's prior written consent |
| **Modification** | PPA terms cannot be modified to the Church's detriment without the Church's prior written consent |
| **Entity action** | Neither LBS, S.A., nor PIF may unilaterally cancel, suspend, or modify this PPA |
| **Founder action** | Daniel Lawless cannot revoke the assignment, even if Daniel leaves the Church, ceases to be Senior Pastor, or undergoes any change in personal circumstances |
| **Survival of assignment** | The assignment survives Daniel's death, incapacity, departure from the Church, or any change in Daniel's relationship with the Church |

**The irrevocability is what makes the PPA assignment to the Church legitimate for IRS purposes. If Daniel could reclaim the PPA, the IRS would argue he still "owns" it (assignment of income doctrine). Irrevocability means the Church — not Daniel — is the economic owner.**

---

### Principle 6: Anti-Dilution

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **New equity** | LBS and S.A. cannot issue new shares, membership interests, or equity interests without the Church's prior written consent |
| **New PPAs** | LBS and S.A. cannot create new Profit Participation Agreements or other economic interests without the Church's prior written consent (or pro-rata participation rights) |
| **Restructuring** | Any restructuring that would reduce the effective percentage of the Church's PPA requires the Church's prior written consent |
| **Pre-emptive rights** | If new economic interests are created, the Church has the right to participate pro-rata to maintain its 30% share |

---

### Principle 7: Non-Subordination

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Debt** | LBS cannot incur new debt that takes priority over PPA distributions without the Church's prior written consent |
| **Management fees** | LBS cannot pay management fees or intercompany charges that reduce Distributable Profits below a reasonable threshold without the Church's prior written consent |
| **New investors** | Future investors cannot receive liquidation preferences that subordinate the Church's PPA |
| **Contractual priority** | PPA distributions rank pari passu with equity distributions and senior to management, advisory, or consulting fees not approved as operating expenses |

---

### Principle 8: Change of Control Protection

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Trigger events** | Sale of LBS, merger, change of more than 50% of equity in S.A. or PIF, change of board majority of LBS, sale of substantially all assets |
| **Automatic exit** | Church's exit participation is triggered automatically on any Change of Control event — Church receives its 30% pro-rata share of proceeds |
| **Put right** | On certain trigger events (key person departure, material breach of this PPA, non-distribution for two or more consecutive quarters), the Church may demand buyout of its PPA interest at fair market value |
| **Tag-along** | If PIF or S.A. sells its equity in LBS, the Church participates on the same terms — effectively, PIF/S.A. must distribute exit proceeds per PPAs before any PIF-level distribution |
| **Drag-along** | If holders of 75% or more of PPA interests approve a sale, all PPA holders must participate on the same terms |

---

### Principle 9: Audit Rights

|---------|------|
| **Annual financial statements** | LBS provides audited (or reviewed) financial statements to the Church within ninety (90) days of fiscal year end |

| **Board materials** | The Church's board representative receives all LBS board materials |

---

### Principle 11: Specific Performance

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Remedy** | The Church may seek specific performance (court-ordered compliance) in addition to monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement |
| **Injunctive relief** | The Church may seek injunctive relief to prevent LBS, S.A., or PIF from taking actions that violate this PPA |
| **Jurisdiction** | Disputes shall be resolved in the DIFC Courts (Dubai International Financial Centre) or by arbitration under LCIA Rules at a neutral venue (London or Singapore) |
| **Acceleration** | If LBS defaults on distributions for two (2) or more consecutive quarters, all accrued and future distributions accelerate and become immediately payable |
| **Costs** | The prevailing party in any dispute shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs |

|---------|------|

---

## 4. Distributable Profit Calculation

```
Gross Revenue (LBS)
  minus Operating Expenses (salaries, rent, technology, professional fees, insurance, etc.)
  minus Intercompany Service Fees (cost-plus to TE Holdings, if applicable)
  minus Board-Approved Reserves (minimum: [3] months operating expenses)
  = DISTRIBUTABLE PROFITS

Church receives: 30% × Distributable Profits
```

| Item | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| **Revenue** | All revenue recognized by LBS from all sources |
| **Operating expenses** | Ordinary and necessary business expenses at arm's length |
| **Reserves** | Board-approved reserves — minimum [3] months operating expenses. Reserve policy reviewed annually. |
| **Capital expenditure** | Funded from reserves or revenue before distribution. CapEx above $[amount] requires PPA holder notification. |
| **Tax** | LBS operates at 0% corporate tax (QFZP). If tax status changes, taxes paid reduce Distributable Profits. |

---

## 5. Distribution Schedule

| Quarter | Period | Distribution Due Date |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Q1 | January 1 – March 31 | May 15 |
| Q2 | April 1 – June 30 | August 15 |
| Q3 | July 1 – September 30 | November 15 |
| Q4 | October 1 – December 31 | February 15 (following year) |

Each distribution shall be accompanied by:
- Statement of Distributable Profits calculation
- Accumulation Account balance
- Variance from prior quarter (if >10%, explanation required)

---

## 6. Vesting

| Parameter | Term |
|-----------|------|
| **Vesting period** | Four (4) years from PPA effective date |
| **Cliff** | One (1) year — 25% vests at 12 months |
| **Monthly vesting** | Remaining 75% vests monthly over 36 months |
| **Acceleration** | Single-trigger on Change of Control (100% vests immediately on entity sale) |
| **Good leaver** | Retains vested portion; unvested portion forfeited |
| **Bad leaver** | Forfeits all (vested + unvested) — repurchased at lower of cost or FMV |
| **Church assignment** | Vesting schedule applies to the Original PPA. Upon irrevocable assignment to the Church, vested portion transfers. Unvested portion vests per schedule with the Church as holder. |

**Note:** Since Daniel's PPA is irrevocably assigned to the Church, vesting mechanics apply to the Church as holder. The Church cannot be a "bad leaver" — it is a permanent institutional holder. Counsel to confirm that assignment does not reset or affect vesting.

---

## 7. Valuation

| Scenario | Method |
|----------|--------|
| **Annual valuation** | Independent third-party valuation or formula-based (revenue multiple agreed herein: [X]x trailing 12-month revenue) |
| **Exit event** | Actual transaction price |
| **Put right buyback** | Most recent independent valuation or formula, whichever is higher |
| **Dispute** | Each party appoints a valuator. If valuations differ by more than 15%, a third independent valuator is jointly appointed and the third valuation is binding. |

---

## 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Governing law** | Laws of the UAE and, where applicable, the DIFC |
| **Primary jurisdiction** | DIFC Courts (Dubai International Financial Centre) |
| **Alternative** | Arbitration under LCIA Rules, seated in London or Singapore, with three arbitrators |
| **Language** | English |
| **Interim relief** | Either party may seek interim or conservatory measures from any court of competent jurisdiction |

---

## 9. Representations and Warranties

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Three-party vs. bilateral:** Should the Church be a direct party to the PPA (four-party: LBS + S.A. + PIF + Church), or should the PPA remain bilateral (LBS + Daniel) with a separate assignment? Which is stronger for enforcement?
2. **DIFC vs. onshore UAE:** Is DIFC the correct governing law and jurisdiction? Would onshore UAE or another jurisdiction provide better enforcement for the Church?
3. **Vesting post-assignment:** Does the irrevocable assignment to the Church reset or affect the vesting schedule? Can an institutional holder (church) be subject to vesting?
4. **Put right mechanics:** What specific trigger events should activate the Church's put right? What valuation method for the buyback?
5. **Acceleration enforceability:** Can the acceleration clause (default on 2+ quarters = all future amounts due) be enforced in DIFC courts?
6. **MFN retroactivity:** Is automatic retroactive amendment enforceable under UAE/DIFC law?
7. **Tax treatment:** Confirm that PPA distributions from a UAE FZ-LLC to a US 508(c)(1)(A) church are (a) not subject to UAE withholding tax, and (b) UBIT-exempt under IRC 512(b)(2).
8. **Gift tax on assignment:** Can the PPA assignment from Daniel to the Church be structured to avoid gift tax? If PPA has zero basis at assignment, what is the gift tax value?
