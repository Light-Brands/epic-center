## Preamble

The church provides because the ministers serve. Among the most ancient expressions of this sacred reciprocity is the provision of housing — a home, a place of rest, a sanctuary from which the minister carries out the work of the spirit. From the Levitical cities to the parsonages of the American frontier, the principle has endured: those who dedicate their lives to the sacred should not bear the burden of shelter alone.

Section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code honors this tradition. It provides that a minister of the gospel may exclude from gross income the amount designated by the employing church as a housing allowance, to the extent that the allowance is used for actual housing costs and does not exceed the fair rental value of the home. There is no statutory dollar cap. The exclusion has been part of the tax code since 1921, and its constitutionality was upheld by the Seventh Circuit in *Gaylor v. Mnuchin* (2019).

This document contains the Church's housing allowance designation resolution and the operational framework for administering the benefit in compliance with IRC 107.

## SECTION 1 — LEGAL FOUNDATION

### 1.1 IRC 107 — The Minister's Housing Allowance

Internal Revenue Code Section 107 provides:

> *"In the case of a minister of the gospel, gross income does not include -- (1) the rental value of a home furnished to him as part of his compensation; or (2) the rental allowance paid to him as part of his compensation, to the extent used by him to rent or provide a home and to the extent such allowance does not exceed the fair rental value of the home, including furnishings and appurtenances such as a garage, plus the cost of utilities."*

### 1.2 Three Limitations on the Exclusion

IRC 107 provides no dollar cap, but the exclusion is limited to the **least** of the following three amounts:

| Limitation | Description | Practical Implication |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **(1) Amount Designated** | The amount officially designated by the church as housing allowance before the tax year begins | The church controls this amount through prospective resolution |
| **(2) Actual Housing Costs** | The minister's actual housing expenses during the tax year (rent/mortgage, utilities, furnishings, insurance, repairs, maintenance, property taxes, etc.) | The minister must track and document actual costs |
| **(3) Fair Rental Value** | The fair rental value of the home, furnished, plus utilities | Requires appraisal or comparable rental analysis |

The minister excludes only the **lowest** of these three amounts. Any excess above the lowest amount is taxable income.

### 1.3 Constitutional Validity

The constitutionality of IRC 107 was challenged and **upheld** in:

**Gaylor v. Mnuchin** (7th Circuit, 2019): The Freedom from Religion Foundation challenged IRC 107 as an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The district court agreed, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that IRC 107 is a permissible legislative accommodation of religion under the Establishment Clause. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case, leaving the Seventh Circuit ruling in effect.

IRC 107 has been in the tax code in some form since 1921. No court has invalidated it. The IRS administers it without controversy. The housing allowance is one of the most well-established minister tax benefits in American law.

### 1.4 No Dollar Cap

There is no statutory dollar cap on the housing allowance. The limitation is functional — the exclusion cannot exceed actual housing costs or fair rental value. This means:

- A minister living in a $500,000 home with $30,000 in annual housing costs can exclude up to $30,000 (limited by actual costs).
- A minister living in a $3,000,000 home with $150,000 in annual housing costs can exclude up to $150,000 (limited by actual costs, if fair rental value is equal or higher).
- A church can designate $500,000 as housing allowance. If actual costs are $150,000 and fair rental value is $180,000, the exclusion is $150,000. The remaining $350,000 is taxable.

The key: **designate generously, document carefully.** Over-designation has no penalty — the excess is simply included in taxable income. Under-designation permanently loses the exclusion for the shortfall.

### 1.5 Who Qualifies as a "Minister of the Gospel"

IRC 107 applies to a "minister of the gospel." The IRS uses a five-factor test (drawn from *Knight v. Commissioner*, 1992, and subsequent rulings):

| Factor | Requirement | Church of the Living Light |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1. Ordained, commissioned, or licensed | The individual must be formally recognized as a minister by the church | Daniel: Founding Senior Pastor — ordained at formation |
| 2. Administers sacraments | Performs sacred ceremonies, rituals, or ordinances | Daniel: Leads worship, ceremonies, healing ministry |
| 3. Conducts worship | Regularly leads worship services | Daniel: Weekly worship services |
| 4. Manages religious organization | Exercises governance over the church's spiritual mission | Daniel: Senior Pastor, Chairman of the Spiritual Council |
| 5. Considered a spiritual leader | Recognized by the church and community as a religious authority | Daniel: Founding spiritual leader, sole doctrinal authority |

A minister need not satisfy all five factors, but should meet a majority. Daniel Lawless satisfies all five as the founding Senior Pastor.

## SECTION 2 — PROSPECTIVE DESIGNATION REQUIREMENT

### 2.1 The Bright Line: Prospective Only

The housing allowance designation **must be adopted before the tax year to which it applies.** This is a non-negotiable bright line.

| Timing | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Designation adopted December 15, 2026 for tax year 2027 | **Valid** for all of 2027 |
| Designation adopted January 1, 2027 for tax year 2027 | **Valid** for all of 2027 (adopted on the first day) |
| Designation adopted January 15, 2027 for tax year 2027 | **Invalid** for January 1-14. Valid only for January 15 - December 31. |
| Designation adopted mid-year for the remainder of the current year | **Valid** only for the period from the date of adoption forward |
| Retroactive designation for a completed year | **Invalid.** Cannot be applied retroactively. |

### 2.2 Annual Renewal Requirement

The housing allowance designation must be **renewed each year** before the start of the new tax year. A designation adopted for tax year 2027 does not automatically carry forward to 2028. The Compensation Committee must adopt a new designation for each tax year.

The Committee's Annual Review Meeting (October-December, per the Charter) is the appropriate time to adopt housing allowance designations for the following year.

### 2.3 First-Year Timing

For the Church's first tax year, the housing allowance designation must be adopted on or before the first day of the tax year. If the Church is formed mid-year, the designation must be adopted before the minister receives any compensation characterized as housing allowance.

**Recommended approach:** Adopt the housing allowance designation at the same Committee meeting that adopts the Initial Compensation Resolutions (Document B02). This ensures both are in place before the first tax year begins.

## SECTION 3 — QUALIFYING HOUSING EXPENSES

### 3.1 What the Housing Allowance Covers

The following expenses qualify as "housing costs" under IRC 107:

| Category | Qualifying Expenses |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Rent or Mortgage** | Rent payments, mortgage principal and interest, down payment |
| **Utilities** | Electric, gas, water, sewer, trash, telephone, internet, cable/streaming services used in the home |
| **Furnishings** | Furniture, appliances, electronics, linens, kitchenware, decorations, art, rugs, window treatments |
| **Insurance** | Homeowner's or renter's insurance, umbrella policy attributable to the home, flood insurance |
| **Repairs and Maintenance** | Structural repairs, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, painting, landscaping, pest control, cleaning services |
| **Property Taxes** | Real property taxes (note: property taxes are deductible as itemized deduction OR excluded via housing allowance, but not both) |
| **Home Improvements** | Renovations, additions, remodeling, new roof, new flooring, kitchen/bathroom upgrades |
| **Yard and Grounds** | Lawn care, gardening, irrigation, fencing, outdoor lighting, driveway maintenance |
| **HOA or Condo Fees** | Homeowner's association dues, condominium fees |
| **Parking** | Garage rental, assigned parking space (if connected to the residence) |
| **Security** | Home security system, monitoring fees |
| **Other** | Any other expense directly related to providing and maintaining the minister's primary residence |

### 3.2 What the Housing Allowance Does NOT Cover

| Excluded Item | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| Food and groceries | Not a housing expense |
| Clothing | Not a housing expense |
| Domestic help (personal) | Not a housing expense unless related to home maintenance |
| Second home / vacation property | IRC 107 applies to one home only (primary residence) |
| Business office expenses | Separate deduction (home office, if applicable) |
| Personal transportation | Not a housing expense |

### 3.3 One Home Limitation

The IRC 107 exclusion applies to **one home** — the minister's primary residence. If the minister maintains multiple residences, the housing allowance applies only to the one designated as the primary home.

## SECTION 4 — HOUSING ALLOWANCE DESIGNATION RESOLUTION

### 4.1 Resolution Template

The following resolution is adopted by the Compensation Committee as part of the initial compensation determination:

---

### RESOLUTION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
### CHURCH OF THE LIVING LIGHT
### HOUSING ALLOWANCE DESIGNATION

**Date of Adoption:** [Date — must be BEFORE the first day of the tax year]

**Tax Year Covered:** [January 1, 20__ through December 31, 20__]

---

**WHEREAS,** the Compensation Committee of the Church of the Living Light is duly constituted with three (3) independent members — Sydney Griffith (Chair), Iryna Voitenko, and Angelina Adelaide — all satisfying the independence requirements of the Compensation Committee Charter and 26 CFR 53.4958-6;

**WHEREAS,** IRC 107 permits a church to designate a portion of a minister's compensation as a housing allowance, excludable from the minister's gross income for federal income tax purposes, to the extent the allowance is used for actual housing costs and does not exceed the fair rental value of the home;

**WHEREAS,** the housing allowance designation must be adopted **prospectively** — before the tax year to which it applies;

**WHEREAS,** the Committee has reviewed comparable data on minister housing allowances and has determined that the following designations are reasonable and consistent with the total compensation packages approved in the Initial Compensation Resolutions (Document B02);

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** that for the tax year beginning **[January 1, 20__]** and ending **[December 31, 20__]**, the following housing allowance designations are hereby adopted:

---

#### Designation 1 — Daniel Lawless, Senior Pastor

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Minister** | Daniel Lawless, Senior Pastor |
| **Designation Amount** | **$[80,000]** per year |
| **Effective Period** | [January 1, 20__] through [December 31, 20__] |
| **Basis** | Portion of total compensation package designated as housing allowance under IRC 107. Included in total package value reviewed against comparable data. |

The Committee notes that the actual exclusion available to the Senior Pastor is limited to the **least** of: (1) this designated amount ($[80,000]), (2) the Senior Pastor's actual housing costs for the tax year, and (3) the fair rental value of the Senior Pastor's home, furnished, plus utilities. Any excess of the designated amount over the lowest of these three figures is taxable income to the Senior Pastor.

---

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Minister** | Jason Sparks, Associate Pastor (if Option C or D elected) |
| **Designation Amount** | **$[Amount — TBD upon election of Option C/D]** per year |
| **Effective Period** | To be determined upon assumption of Associate Pastor role |
| **Basis** | Contingent designation. Full designation to be adopted when Jason formally assumes the Associate Pastor role and the Committee completes a full compensation determination. |

This designation is contingent and does not take effect until: (a) Jason Sparks formally elects Option C or D, (b) Jason Sparks is ordained as a minister of the Church of the Living Light, and (c) the Committee adopts a binding housing allowance designation through the Charter process.

---

#### Future Designations — Jennifer Lawless, Timothy Lawless, and Others

The Committee notes that the following individuals may become eligible for housing allowance designations in future tax years, upon completion of ordination:

| Individual | Current Role | Ordination Status | Housing Allowance Eligibility |

| **Others** | Future ministers | N/A | The Committee will designate housing allowances for all ordained ministers as they join the Church's ministry. |

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that the Committee shall adopt housing allowance designations for any newly ordained minister before the first tax year in which the minister claims the exclusion.

---

## SECTION 5 — FORM 4361: SELF-EMPLOYMENT TAX OPT-OUT

### 5.1 Overview

Ministers of the gospel are treated as **self-employed** for Social Security and Medicare tax purposes (FICA/SE tax), regardless of whether they are common-law employees of the church. This means that minister compensation (including housing allowance) is subject to self-employment tax at a combined rate of **15.3%** (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare).

However, ministers may elect to **opt out** of the self-employment tax system entirely by filing **Form 4361** (Application for Exemption From Self-Employment Tax for Use by Ministers, Members of Religious Orders and Christian Science Practitioners).

### 5.2 Form 4361 Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Who may file** | Ordained, commissioned, or licensed ministers of the gospel |
| **Basis for exemption** | The minister must be conscientiously opposed to, or because of religious principles opposed to, acceptance of any public insurance (including Social Security and Medicare) that makes payments in the event of death, disability, old age, or retirement |
| **Filing deadline** | Must be filed by the due date of the federal income tax return (including extensions) for the **second tax year** in which the minister has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more |
| **Approval** | IRS approves the application. Once approved, the exemption is **irrevocable** |
| **Effect** | No self-employment tax on ministerial earnings. Minister does not earn Social Security credits for ministerial service. |

### 5.3 Tax Savings

| Scenario | Without Form 4361 | With Form 4361 | Annual Savings |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Minister salary: $80,000 + Housing allowance: $80,000 = $160,000 SE income | $160,000 x 15.3% = **$24,480** SE tax | **$0** SE tax | **$24,480** |
| At Y5 levels: $300,000 salary + $300,000 housing = $600,000 SE income | $600,000 x (subject to SS cap + Medicare) = **~$28,000+** | **$0** SE tax | **~$28,000+** |

The Form 4361 exemption saves the minister approximately **15.3%** on all ministerial earnings. This is one of the most significant tax benefits available to ordained ministers.

### 5.4 Important Considerations

(a) **Irrevocable.** Once approved, the Form 4361 exemption cannot be revoked. The minister permanently opts out of Social Security for ministerial earnings.

(b) **No Social Security credits.** The minister does not earn Social Security quarters of coverage for ministerial service. This may affect retirement benefits, disability benefits, and Medicare eligibility (though most ministers have other covered employment or can purchase Medicare).

(c) **Ministerial earnings only.** The exemption applies only to earnings from ministerial services. If the minister has other employment (e.g., LBS salary), that employment is subject to normal FICA/SE tax.

(d) **Conscientious opposition.** The IRS requires that the exemption be based on religious or conscientious opposition to public insurance, not merely a desire to save taxes. The minister must attest to this opposition on Form 4361.

---

## SECTION 6 — DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 6.1 Minister's Responsibility

The minister claiming the IRC 107 exclusion is responsible for:

(a) **Tracking actual housing costs.** The minister must maintain records of all qualifying housing expenses throughout the tax year. Receipts, invoices, bank statements, and cancelled checks should be retained.

(b) **Determining fair rental value.** The minister should obtain a fair rental value estimate for the home, furnished, plus utilities. This can be done through:
   - A formal real estate appraisal;
   - Comparable rental listings in the same neighborhood;
   - A letter from a real estate professional estimating fair rental value;
   - Online rental valuation tools (Zillow Rent Zestimate, Redfin Rental Estimate).

(c) **Calculating the exclusion.** At year-end, the minister determines the excludable amount as the least of: designated amount, actual costs, and fair rental value.

(d) **Reporting on tax return.** The housing allowance is reported as follows:
   - **Form W-2, Box 14:** Church reports the housing allowance amount (informational);
   - **Form W-2, Boxes 1, 3, 5:** Housing allowance is **excluded** from these boxes;
   - **Form 1040, Schedule SE:** Housing allowance is included in self-employment income (unless Form 4361 exemption applies);
   - **Form 1040:** Any excess of designated amount over the excludable amount is reported as taxable income.

### 6.2 Church's Responsibility

The Church is responsible for:

(a) **Adopting the designation prospectively.** The resolution must be adopted before the tax year begins.

(b) **Maintaining the resolution in Church records.** The Secretary files the resolution with the Church's official records.

(c) **Reporting on Form W-2.** The housing allowance amount is reported in Box 14 of the minister's W-2 and excluded from taxable wages in Boxes 1, 3, and 5.

(d) **Annual renewal.** The Committee adopts a new designation each year.

---

## SECTION 7 — FAIR RENTAL VALUE GUIDANCE

### 7.1 What Fair Rental Value Means

Fair rental value (FRV) is the amount that a comparable home — furnished and including utilities — would rent for in the same area. It is not the market value of the home. It is the rental value.

### 7.2 How to Establish Fair Rental Value

| Method | Description | Recommended? |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Formal appraisal** | Licensed appraiser provides written FRV estimate | Best documentation — recommended for high-value homes |
| **Comparable rental listings** | Gather 3-5 rental listings for comparable homes in the same area | Good documentation — cost-effective |
| **Real estate professional letter** | Licensed real estate agent provides written FRV estimate | Good documentation |
| **Online tools** | Zillow Rent Zestimate, Redfin Rental Estimate | Supplementary — should not be sole source |

### 7.3 Frequency of FRV Determination

The minister should obtain a fair rental value determination **at least every three (3) years**, or more frequently if the housing market in the area is changing rapidly (appreciation or depreciation). For the first year, an initial FRV determination should be obtained before the tax year begins.

---

## SECTION 8 — DUBAI RESIDENCE AND INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 8.1 Can the Housing Allowance Cover a Dubai Residence?

This is a question that requires counsel's definitive opinion. The relevant analysis:

**The statute (IRC 107)** does not limit the housing allowance to a US residence. It refers to "a home" without geographic restriction. The minister's "home" for IRC 107 purposes is generally the minister's primary residence.

**The FEIE interaction:** Daniel Lawless qualifies for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE, IRC 911) based on his employment with Light Brands Studio (Dubai). The FEIE excludes up to $130,000 of foreign earned income from US taxation. The FEIE also provides a Foreign Housing Exclusion (IRC 911(a)(2)) for housing costs incurred abroad.

**Potential issue — double benefit:** If Daniel claims both the IRC 107 housing allowance exclusion (from Church compensation) and the IRC 911 Foreign Housing Exclusion (from LBS compensation) for the same housing costs, this could constitute a double benefit. IRS Publication 517 and the regulations do not explicitly address this intersection.

**Possible approaches:**

| Approach | Description | Risk Level |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Allocate housing costs** | Allocate total housing costs between IRC 107 (Church compensation) and IRC 911 (LBS compensation). Each exclusion covers a portion. No overlap. | Lower risk — conservative |
| **IRC 107 for US housing, IRC 911 for Dubai housing** | If Daniel maintains a US residence (or the Church provides a US parsonage), use IRC 107 for US housing costs and IRC 911 for Dubai housing costs | Lower risk — cleanest separation |
| **IRC 107 for Dubai residence** | Use IRC 107 exclusion for Dubai housing costs. Do not claim IRC 911 housing exclusion. | Moderate risk — statute does not restrict to US, but IRS may challenge |

### 8.2 Counsel Questions on International Housing

The following questions must be resolved by counsel before the housing allowance designation is applied to international housing:

1. **Does IRC 107 apply to a foreign residence?** Is there any statutory, regulatory, or case law limitation restricting the housing allowance to a US home?

2. **Does the FEIE housing exclusion interact with IRC 107?** Can a minister claim both exclusions for different income sources (Church salary vs. LBS salary) without a double-benefit issue, even if applied to the same residence?

3. **If Daniel maintains both a US residence and a Dubai residence, can separate exclusions apply to each?** IRC 107 for the US residence (from Church compensation), IRC 911(a)(2) for the Dubai residence (from LBS compensation)?

4. **Does the "tax home" analysis under IRC 911 affect the IRC 107 analysis?** If Daniel's tax home is Dubai (for FEIE purposes), does that affect where IRC 107 housing costs may be incurred?

| **Designation must be prospective** | Adopted before the tax year begins. Cannot be retroactive. | Exclusion invalid for the retroactive period. Housing allowance is fully taxable for that period. |
| **No dollar cap** | IRC 107 has no statutory cap on the amount designated | N/A — but exclusion is limited to actual costs and FRV |
| **Limited to least of three** | Designated amount, actual costs, or fair rental value | Excess is taxable income |
| **One home only** | Exclusion applies to minister's primary residence | Second home costs are not excludable |
| **Must be ordained** | Minister must be ordained, commissioned, or licensed by the church | Non-ordained individuals do not qualify for IRC 107 |
| **Annual renewal** | New designation required each year | Prior year designation does not carry forward |
| **Documentation** | Minister must track actual costs; church must maintain resolution | Inadequate documentation weakens exclusion if challenged |
| **Form 4361 (optional)** | Minister may opt out of SE tax on ministerial earnings | Irrevocable. Saves 15.3% but forfeits Social Security credits. |

---

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Dubai residence and IRC 107:** Can the housing allowance exclusion apply to housing costs incurred in Dubai (or any foreign jurisdiction)? The statute does not contain a geographic limitation, but counsel should confirm there is no regulatory or case law restriction. This is the most critical open question for Daniel's tax planning.

2. **FEIE interaction:** If Daniel claims both the IRC 107 housing allowance exclusion (from Church compensation) and the IRC 911 Foreign Housing Exclusion (from LBS compensation), is there a double-benefit issue? Must housing costs be allocated between the two exclusions? Can separate income sources support separate housing exclusions applied to the same residence?

3. **Designation amount strategy:** Should the Church designate generously (e.g., $150,000) to ensure the minister captures the full exclusion if actual costs are high? Over-designation has no penalty (excess is taxable), but under-designation permanently loses the exclusion for the shortfall. Is there any IRS guidance suggesting that excessive designation amounts invite scrutiny, even though the exclusion is self-limiting?

4. **Fair rental value — Dubai:** If the housing allowance applies to a Dubai residence, how should fair rental value be determined for a foreign property? Is a US-based appraiser appropriate, or must a local (Dubai) valuation be obtained?

5. **Ordination of other family members:** Jennifer, Timothy, and Nancy are not currently ordained. What is the minimum ordination process required for each to qualify as a "minister of the gospel" under IRC 107? Can the Church's own ordination program (Document E01) satisfy this requirement, or must ordination meet external standards?

6. **Form 4361 timing and strategy:** Should Daniel file Form 4361 immediately upon formation, or wait until the second tax year with $400+ in ministerial SE earnings (as required by the filing deadline)? Is there any advantage to filing in the first year?

7. **Property taxes and double benefit:** If a minister deducts property taxes as an itemized deduction on Schedule A, can the same property taxes also be excluded under IRC 107? IRS guidance indicates that property taxes cannot be claimed both as an itemized deduction and as a housing allowance exclusion. Confirm this rule and ensure the minister's tax return is consistent.
