## Spiritual Preamble

*Accountability is an act of love.*

*The Church of the Living Light does not remove its leaders lightly. We believe in the redemptive power of grace, in the capacity of every human being to grow through failure, and in the sacred obligation to extend patience before judgment. But we also believe that leadership is a trust — and that trust, once genuinely broken, must be addressed with clarity, with fairness, and with the courage to act.*

*This document exists because we refuse to pretend that our leaders are beyond accountability. The Sacred Laws teach us that every soul has free will (Law 2) and that every experience serves the soul's evolution (Law 7). Sometimes the most loving thing a community can do is to say: this is the boundary. You have crossed it. And here is the process by which we respond — not with vengeance, not with haste, but with the structured fairness that every person deserves.*

*These procedures apply only to non-founder Council members. The co-founders — Daniel Lawless and Jennifer Lawless — serve with life tenure and are subject to a separate, far more stringent removal standard (unanimous vote plus felony, moral turpitude, or permanent incapacity). This distinction is deliberate. The co-founders built this church. Their tenure is foundational. But the Council members who serve alongside them do so under a different covenant — one that requires ongoing fidelity to the mission, and one that this document defines with precision.*

*We do this not because we expect to use it, but because the Ethic of Integrity demands that we build the structure before we need it.*

## PART I — SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY

### Section 1. Applicability

This document establishes the detailed procedures for the for-cause removal of **non-founder Spiritual Council members** pursuant to Article III, Section 4 of the Bylaws of the Church of the Living Light (the "Bylaws").

### Section 2. Who Is Subject to These Procedures

The following Council members are subject to for-cause removal under these procedures:

| Seat | Name | Title |
|------|------|-------|
| 3 | Timothy Lawless | Director of Operations & Administration, Treasurer |
| 4 | Nancy Courchesne | Director of Outreach & Programs, Secretary |
| 5 | Iryna Voitenko | Council Member, Compensation Committee |
| 6 | Sydney Griffith | Council Member, Compensation Committee Chair |
| 7 | Angelina Adelaide | Council Member, Compensation Committee |

And any future non-founder Council members appointed through the Nominations Committee process.

### Section 3. Who Is NOT Subject to These Procedures

| Person | Reason | Governing Provision |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Daniel Lawless (Senior Pastor) | Life tenure — removal only by unanimous vote + extreme cause | Article II, Section 3 |
| Jennifer Lawless (Co-Founder) | Life tenure — removal only by unanimous vote + extreme cause | Article IIA, Section 2 |

The co-founders' removal standard (unanimous vote of all other members plus felony conviction, proven moral turpitude, or permanent incapacity) is entirely separate from these procedures and is not governed by this document.

### Section 4. Governing Standard

Removal of a non-founder Council member requires:

(a) A finding of **cause** — one of the seven (7) enumerated grounds set forth in Part II;

(b) Compliance with the **procedural requirements** set forth in Part III;

(c) A **supermajority vote of five (5) of seven (7)** Council members (the member subject to removal does not vote, making the effective threshold five (5) of six (6) voting members).

---

## PART II — ENUMERATED CAUSES FOR REMOVAL

### Section 5. The Seven Enumerated Causes

A non-founder Council member may be removed only for one or more of the following seven (7) enumerated causes. No other grounds shall constitute cause for removal.

#### Cause 1: Failure to Serve

**Definition:** Absence from three (3) or more consecutive Council meetings without justification accepted by the Council.

**Standard:** The Council determines whether an absence is justified. Acceptable justifications include medical emergency, family emergency, pre-approved travel, and military service. Unacceptable justifications include general disinterest, scheduling conflicts that are not communicated in advance, and chronic unavailability without a plan for resolution.

**Evidence required:** Meeting attendance records maintained by the Secretary.

#### Cause 2: Loss of Independence

**Definition:** Entering a financial relationship with Light Brands, any Transformational Epicenter entity, or any entity in the Church's corporate structure that compromises the Council member's independence for IRS purposes.

**Applicability:** This cause applies primarily to Compensation Committee members (Seats 5, 6, and 7), whose independence is essential to the rebuttable presumption under 26 CFR 53.4958-6. However, it applies to all non-founder members because independence from the commercial entities preserves the integrity of the Church's governance.

**Examples:**
- Accepting employment with Light Brands Services LLC (Dubai)
- Entering a consulting agreement with Light Brands Capital LLC (Cook Islands)
- Receiving equity, profit participation, or any financial benefit from any entity in the TE structure
- Accepting a loan from the Senior Pastor, the Co-Founder, or any related party

**Evidence required:** Documentary evidence of the financial relationship (contracts, payments, disclosures, or public filings).

#### Cause 3: Criminal Conduct

**Definition:** Conviction of a felony or any crime involving dishonesty (fraud, embezzlement, perjury, forgery, theft, or similar offenses), in any jurisdiction.

**Standard:** Conviction means a final judgment of guilt entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. A guilty plea or plea of no contest (nolo contendere) constitutes conviction for purposes of this provision. An indictment alone does not constitute conviction but may support a Governance Pause or voluntary leave pending resolution.

**Evidence required:** Certified court records of conviction.

#### Cause 4: Conduct Harmful to the Church

**Definition:** Actions that materially harm the Church's mission, reputation, or financial integrity, as determined by the Council.

**Standard:** The Council exercises reasonable judgment in determining whether conduct is materially harmful. Isolated minor incidents do not meet this standard. The conduct must be substantial and must have caused or be reasonably likely to cause significant harm to the Church.

**Examples:**
- Public statements that materially misrepresent the Church's doctrine, finances, or leadership
- Engaging in conduct that brings public disrepute to the Church
- Taking actions that jeopardize the Church's tax-exempt status
- Interfering with the Church's relationships with its community, partners, or vendors in a manner that causes material harm

**Evidence required:** Witness statements, documentary evidence, media reports, or other credible evidence of the conduct and its harmful effect.

#### Cause 5: Breach of Confidentiality

**Definition:** Unauthorized disclosure of Church financial records, Council deliberations, compensation decisions, Governance Pause proceedings, or any other information designated as confidential by the Council or by the Confidentiality Agreement ([E04](./E04-CONFIDENTIALITY-AGREEMENT-COUNCIL.md)).

**Standard:** Disclosure must be unauthorized — meaning not approved by the Council, not required by law, and not made to the member's own legal counsel for the purpose of seeking personal legal advice. The disclosure must be to a person or entity not authorized to receive the information.

**Examples:**
- Sharing Council meeting minutes with non-Council members without authorization
- Disclosing individual compensation amounts to the public or media
- Sharing Governance Pause deliberations with persons outside the Council
- Posting confidential Church financial information on social media

**Evidence required:** Evidence of the disclosure (documents, communications, witness testimony) and confirmation that the disclosure was not authorized.

#### Cause 6: Violation of the Relationship Provision

**Definition:** Forming a romantic, dating, or domestic partnership relationship with another Council member and refusing to either end the relationship or resign from the Council within thirty (30) days of the relationship becoming known to the Council, as required by Article III, Section 7 of the Bylaws.

**Standard:** The 30-day period begins when the relationship becomes known to the Council (by disclosure, discovery, or report). If the member neither ends the relationship nor resigns within 30 days, the violation is established.

**Evidence required:** Evidence of the relationship (disclosure by the parties, witness testimony, or other credible evidence) and documentation that 30 days have elapsed without compliance.

Detailed policy and procedures are set forth in [B07 Relationship Prohibition Policy](./B07-RELATIONSHIP-PROHIBITION-POLICY.md).

#### Cause 7: Breach of Fiduciary Duty

**Definition:** Self-dealing, misappropriation of Church funds, or failure to act in the Church's best interest in a manner that constitutes a breach of the member's fiduciary duty as a director under applicable state law.

**Standard:** Fiduciary duty includes the duty of care (acting with the care an ordinarily prudent person would exercise), the duty of loyalty (acting in the Church's best interest, not the member's personal interest), and the duty of obedience (acting within the Church's stated purposes). Breach of any component constitutes cause.

**Examples:**
- Approving transactions that benefit the member personally at the Church's expense
- Diverting Church funds, property, or opportunities to personal use
- Voting on matters where the member has an undisclosed conflict of interest
- Failing to exercise reasonable oversight of Church finances or operations when the member has a duty to do so

**Evidence required:** Financial records, transaction documentation, conflict of interest disclosures (or absence thereof), and any other evidence of the breach.

---

### Section 6. What Is NOT Valid Cause for Removal

The following are expressly **not** valid grounds for removal under these procedures:

| Not Valid Cause | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **Disagreement with the Senior Pastor's doctrinal decisions** | Doctrinal authority is vested exclusively in the Senior Pastor (Article II, Section 4). Council members are not required to personally agree with every doctrinal determination. Doctrinal disagreement is protected. |
| **Voting against the Senior Pastor on a governance matter** | Every Council member has the right to vote according to their conscience. A vote against the Senior Pastor's position is the exercise of fiduciary duty, not a violation of it. |
| **Personal conflict with any other member** | Personal friction, personality differences, or interpersonal tension are not grounds for removal — absent conduct that rises to the level of "conduct harmful to the Church" (Cause 4). |
| **Change in personal circumstances** | Divorce, relocation, change in employment, or other personal life changes are not grounds for removal — unless the change results in failure to serve (Cause 1) or loss of independence (Cause 2). |

The enumeration of invalid causes is not exhaustive. The general principle is: **removal is reserved for conduct, not opinion; for breach, not disagreement.**

---

## PART III — REMOVAL PROCEDURE

### Section 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

The following procedure applies to all for-cause removal proceedings. Each step is mandatory. Failure to follow the procedure renders any removal invalid.

#### Step 1: Written Notice of Proposed Removal

(a) Any Council member may initiate removal proceedings by delivering a **Written Notice of Proposed Removal** to the member whose removal is sought (the "Respondent").

(b) The Written Notice must be in the format set forth in Appendix A (Notice Template).

(c) The Written Notice must state:
- The specific enumerated cause (or causes) for removal;
- The specific facts supporting each stated cause, in sufficient detail for the Respondent to understand and respond;
- The Bylaws provision(s) alleged to have been violated;
- The date by which the Respondent must submit a written response (14 calendar days from delivery);
- The Respondent's right to attend the Council meeting, to speak, and to present evidence.

(d) The Written Notice shall be delivered to the Respondent by hand delivery, certified mail, or email to the Respondent's address of record. Delivery to the Respondent's email of record constitutes effective delivery.

(e) A copy of the Written Notice shall be delivered simultaneously to all Council members and to the Secretary.

#### Step 2: Written Response Period (14 Calendar Days)

(a) The Respondent has **fourteen (14) calendar days** from the date of delivery of the Written Notice to submit a written response.

(b) The written response may be in any format and may include:
- A denial of the alleged facts;
- An explanation or justification of the Respondent's conduct;
- Mitigating circumstances;
- Supporting documentation or witness statements;
- A request for additional time (which the Council may grant or deny by majority vote);
- Any other information the Respondent wishes the Council to consider.

(c) The written response shall be delivered to the Secretary and to all Council members.

(d) Failure to submit a written response within 14 days does not constitute an admission of the allegations. However, the Council may proceed to Step 3 without a response.

(e) The Respondent's written response format is set forth in Appendix B (Response Template).

#### Step 3: Council Meeting — Hearing

(a) Within **fourteen (14) calendar days** after the expiration of the response period (or receipt of the Respondent's response, whichever is earlier), the Secretary shall convene a meeting of the Spiritual Council to hear the removal matter.

(b) **Quorum:** Four (4) of seven (7) members constitute a quorum. The Respondent counts toward quorum.

(c) **Attendance:** The Respondent has the right to attend the meeting, to speak, to present evidence, and to respond to questions. The Respondent's attendance is voluntary — the meeting may proceed in the Respondent's absence.

(d) **Presentation of case:** The Council member who initiated the removal proceedings presents the Written Notice, the supporting facts, and any evidence. The Respondent then presents the written response and any additional information.

(e) **Deliberation:** All Council members (including the Respondent) may ask questions and deliberate on the merits. The Respondent may respond to any questions directed to the Respondent.

(f) **Executive session:** After presentation and deliberation, the Respondent withdraws from the meeting. The remaining Council members deliberate in executive session without the Respondent present.

(g) **Legal counsel:** The Council may invite legal counsel to attend the hearing in an advisory capacity. The Respondent may also have legal counsel present, but counsel may not speak on the Respondent's behalf during the hearing — only advise the Respondent.

#### Step 4: Vote

(a) Following deliberation in executive session, the Council votes on the proposed removal.

(b) The vote requires **five (5) of seven (7)** Council members. The Respondent does not vote, making the effective threshold **five (5) of six (6)** voting members.

(c) The vote is by written ballot, collected and tallied by the Secretary.

(d) Each voting member's vote is recorded in the Council minutes. Votes are not anonymous.

(e) If the initiating Council member is the Senior Pastor, the vote count includes the Senior Pastor's vote. The Senior Pastor is a voting member except on the Senior Pastor's own compensation.

#### Step 5: Decision Documentation

(a) The Secretary documents the Council's decision in the Council minutes, using the Resolution Template set forth in Appendix C.

(b) The documentation must include:
- The date of the meeting;
- The names of all members present and absent;
- A summary of the Written Notice and the Respondent's response;
- The vote count (for, against, abstain) with each member's vote recorded;
- The Council's decision (removal approved or removal denied);
- If approved: the effective date of removal;
- If denied: a statement that the Respondent remains in good standing.

(c) A copy of the documented decision shall be delivered to the Respondent within seven (7) days of the meeting.

#### Step 6: Effective Date (If Removal Approved)

(a) If the Council votes to approve removal, the removal is **effective immediately** upon announcement of the vote result, unless the Council specifies a later effective date (not to exceed seven (7) days from the vote).

(b) The Respondent's Council seat becomes vacant immediately upon the effective date.

(c) All committee assignments held by the Respondent terminate immediately upon the effective date.

(d) The Respondent shall return all Church property, records, and confidential materials within fourteen (14) days of the effective date.

(e) The Secretary updates all Church records to reflect the removal.

#### Step 7: Vacancy

(a) The vacancy created by removal is filled through the normal Nominations Committee process (Article VII, Section 1).

(b) The Senior Pastor nominates a replacement through the Nominations Committee. The Council confirms by majority vote.

(c) There is no requirement to fill the vacancy within a specific timeframe, provided the Council maintains a quorum (4 of 7).

(d) The removed member may not be re-nominated to the Council for a period of three (3) years from the effective date of removal.

---

## PART IV — COOLING OFF INTERACTION

### Section 8. Post-Pause Cooling Off Restrictions

(a) During the **one (1) year cooling off period** following the end of a Governance Pause (as defined in [B05 Governance Pause Procedures](./B05-GOVERNANCE-PAUSE-PROCEDURES.md), Part VI), the Senior Pastor may not initiate removal proceedings against any Council member.

(b) **Exception:** The Senior Pastor may initiate removal proceedings during the cooling off period only for:
- **Criminal conduct** (Cause 3 — felony conviction or crime involving dishonesty); or
- **Breach of fiduciary duty** (Cause 7 — self-dealing, misappropriation, failure to act in the Church's best interest).

(c) For all other enumerated causes (Causes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6), the Senior Pastor must wait until the cooling off period expires before initiating removal proceedings.

(d) **Other Council members are not restricted.** Any Council member other than the Senior Pastor may initiate removal proceedings at any time, including during the cooling off period, for any of the seven enumerated causes.

(e) The cooling off restriction applies to the **initiation** of proceedings — the filing of the Written Notice (Step 1). If removal proceedings were properly initiated before the cooling off period began, they may proceed to completion during the cooling off period.

### Section 9. Rationale

The cooling off restriction exists to prevent retaliatory removal. A Governance Pause is an accountability mechanism. The person who returns from a pause may feel aggrieved — and the temptation to punish those who triggered or supported the pause is real. The cooling off period ensures that the first year after a pause is a time of rebuilding, not retribution. This restriction embodies the Ethic of Humility and the Law of Harmony.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **State-specific removal thresholds:** The 5/7 supermajority (effectively 5/6 of voting members, or 83%) is an unusually high removal threshold. Some states impose statutory minimum or maximum removal thresholds for nonprofit directors. Counsel should confirm that 5/7 is enforceable in the chosen state and that the state does not impose a lower maximum threshold.

2. **Due process requirements:** Although nonprofit corporations are private entities not bound by constitutional due process, some states impose statutory procedural requirements for director removal (notice, hearing, opportunity to respond). Confirm that the 14-day response period and hearing opportunity satisfy any applicable state requirements.

3. **Enumeration as limitation:** The seven enumerated causes are intended to be exhaustive — no other grounds are valid. Counsel should confirm that a bylaws provision limiting removal to enumerated causes is enforceable and that a court would not imply additional grounds under state law.

4. **"Conduct harmful to the Church" — specificity:** Cause 4 ("conduct harmful to the Church") is the broadest of the enumerated causes. Could a member challenge removal under this cause as insufficiently specific? Should the bylaws provide additional guidance on what constitutes "material harm"?

5. **Cooling off period — legal effect:** The restriction on the Senior Pastor initiating removal proceedings during the 1-year post-pause cooling off period is an internal governance constraint. Could the Senior Pastor argue that this restriction violates the Senior Pastor's fiduciary duty to address director misconduct promptly? The exception for criminal conduct and breach of fiduciary duty is designed to address the most serious cases, but counsel should evaluate whether the restriction is defensible.

6. **Re-nomination prohibition:** The 3-year prohibition on re-nomination of a removed member is a governance policy, not a lifetime ban. Confirm that a bylaws-level prohibition on re-nomination for a fixed period is enforceable under state law.

7. **Legal counsel at hearing:** The procedure permits both the Council and the Respondent to have legal counsel present. Should the Church's legal counsel be separate from any personal counsel retained by the Respondent? Are there privilege or conflict-of-interest concerns?

8. **Executive session:** The procedure calls for deliberation in executive session after the Respondent withdraws. Under state law, are there any open-meeting requirements that apply to nonprofit boards? (Generally no, but counsel should confirm for the chosen state.)

9. **Interaction with employment:** If the removed Council member also holds a staff position (e.g., Timothy Lawless as Treasurer, Nancy Courchesne as Secretary), does removal from the Council automatically terminate the employment relationship? The bylaws should be clear on whether these are separate relationships. Removal from the Council should not automatically terminate employment without a separate employment action.
