## Preamble

The spiritual content of the Church of the Living Light is not a commodity. It is revelation made tangible — the distillation of prayer, practice, and lived devotion into materials that carry the frequency of healing. When the Church licenses this content, it is not selling a product. It is extending an invitation. It is saying: *what we have received, we offer forward, and we trust that the reciprocity of the universe will honor what is given.*

This Content License Agreement is an act of sacred exchange. The Church shares its spiritual wisdom with TE Wellness Holdings so that healing may reach those who need it. TE Wellness Holdings compensates the Church through royalty, so that the Church's mission may continue and grow. Neither party takes from the other. Both give. Both receive. The economics are arm's length because integrity demands it. The terms are bulletproof because the mission demands it.

### 4.3 Exclusivity

The license is exclusive to Holdings and its affiliated TE entities.

---

## 5. Royalty

### 5.1 Royalty Rate

Holdings shall pay to the Church a royalty equal to [__]% of Net Revenue derived from TE products and services that incorporate Licensed Content (the "Royalty").

**Counsel Note:** The royalty rate must be established through a transfer pricing study using comparable uncontrolled transaction (CUT) method or other accepted methodology. Comparable rates in the wellness/spiritual content licensing industry shall be documented. The rate must be arm's length — neither inflated (disguised distribution) nor deflated (private inurement / shortchanging the Church).

### 5.2 Royalty Calculation Methodology

```
Gross Revenue from TE products incorporating Licensed Content
  minus Returns, refunds, and chargebacks
  minus Payment processing fees directly attributable to Licensed Content products
  = NET REVENUE

Royalty = [__]% x Net Revenue
```

|---------|-----------|
| **Incorporating Licensed Content** | A TE product or service "incorporates" Licensed Content if it contains, displays, delivers, or is materially based upon content created by the Church's ministers |
| **Revenue allocation** | If a TE product includes both Licensed Content and non-church content, revenue shall be allocated on a reasonable basis (e.g., proportional to content hours, modules, or other verifiable metric). Allocation methodology to be agreed annually and documented. |
| **Minimum royalty** | [Counsel to advise — should there be a minimum annual royalty to ensure the Church receives baseline compensation regardless of product sales?] |

### 5.3 Payment Schedule

| Quarter | Period | Royalty Due Date |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Q1 | January 1 -- March 31 | May 15 |
| Q2 | April 1 -- June 30 | August 15 |

- Royalty amount due

### 5.4 Currency and Payment Method

## 6. Applicable Bulletproof Principles

The following principles from the Governing Framework apply to this license with the same force as they apply to the PPA agreements. These are not aspirational — they are contractual.

### Principle 1: Profit Participation (via Royalty)

The Church participates in the economic success of TE products through its royalty. As TE revenue grows, the Church's royalty income grows proportionally. The royalty is the Church's participation in the value its content creates.

### Principle 3: Distribution Parity

Royalty payments are made on the same quarterly schedule as PPA distributions. Holdings shall not delay royalty payments while making other distributions to equity holders or PPA holders.

### Principle 5: Irrevocability

This license survives changes in leadership, entity restructuring, and any modification of the relationship between the parties. The license cannot be terminated by Holdings without cause. The Church's IP ownership is permanent and irrevocable.

### Principle 7: Non-Subordination

Holdings shall not incur debt, management fees, or intercompany charges that reduce the revenue base from which the Church's royalty is calculated, except for ordinary operating expenses. The royalty obligation ranks senior to management fees and advisory fees not classified as operating expenses.

### Principle 9: Audit Rights

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Church audit right** | The Church may engage its own auditor to examine Holdings' books and records related to royalty calculation, at the Church's expense, once per fiscal year, with thirty (30) days' written notice |
| **Royalty verification** | The Church may request a detailed calculation of Net Revenue and royalty for any payment period |
| **Records retention** | Holdings shall maintain complete records supporting royalty calculations for a minimum of seven (7) years |
| **Underpayment** | If an audit reveals underpayment of royalty by more than 5%, Holdings shall pay the shortfall plus interest at [__]% per annum, and Holdings shall bear the cost of the audit |

### Principle 10: Information Rights

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Quarterly royalty statement** | Detailed calculation per Section 5.3, within fifteen (15) days of quarter end |
| **Annual report** | Summary of all TE products incorporating Licensed Content, revenue by product, and aggregate royalty for the fiscal year |
| **Material event notification** | Prompt written notice of: new product launches incorporating Licensed Content, discontinuation of products, material changes to pricing, regulatory actions affecting Licensed Content |

### Principle 11: Specific Performance

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Remedy** | The Church may seek specific performance for any breach, including court-ordered royalty payment and compliance with license terms |
| **Injunctive relief** | The Church may seek injunctive relief to prevent unauthorized use of Licensed Content or breach of exclusivity provisions |
| **Acceleration** | If Holdings defaults on royalty payments for two (2) or more consecutive quarters, all accrued and estimated future royalties for the balance of the fiscal year accelerate and become immediately payable |
| **Costs** | The prevailing party in any dispute shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs |

### Principle 12: Survival

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Re-domiciliation** | If Holdings moves to a new jurisdiction, all license terms survive and bind the successor entity |
| **Entity conversion** | If Holdings changes legal form, all license terms survive |
| **Restructuring** | If Holdings merges, spins off, or reorganizes, the license and royalty obligation attach to the successor or surviving entity |
| **Post-termination** | Upon termination, Holdings shall cease all use of Licensed Content within ninety (90) days. Royalty obligations for the period through termination survive. Audit rights survive for three (3) years post-termination. |

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Royalty rate:** What is the arm's-length royalty rate for spiritual/wellness content licensing? Counsel should commission a transfer pricing study using CUT method with comparables from the wellness, mindfulness, and faith-based content industries. Range of 5-15% of net revenue is typical for content licensing — confirm with study.

2. **Revenue allocation methodology:** How should revenue be allocated between Licensed Content and non-church content in bundled TE products? Proportional by module, by content hours, or by other metric? This allocation must be defensible under transfer pricing rules.

3. **Minimum royalty:** Should the Agreement include a minimum annual royalty to protect the Church from zero payments during product development periods? If so, what amount?

4. **UBIT analysis:** Confirm that royalty income from this license is exempt from Unrelated Business Income Tax under IRC 512(b)(2) (royalties excluded from UBIT). If the Church provides significant services alongside the license (e.g., content updates, training), could the IRS recharacterize royalty as service income subject to UBIT?

5. **Cayman withholding:** Confirm zero withholding on royalty payments from a Cayman Exempted Company to a US 508(c)(1)(A) church. Cayman has no income tax or withholding tax — confirm this extends to royalty payments.

6. **Sublicense scope:** The license permits sublicensing within the TE entity ecosystem only. Should this include future entities not yet formed? Should sublicense terms mirror the master license?

7. **Content quality standards:** Should the Agreement include provisions requiring the Church to maintain quality standards for Licensed Content? Or does this create a service obligation that undermines royalty characterization?

8. **Interaction with PPA:** The Church receives both PPA distributions (from LBS/LBC) and royalty payments (from Holdings). Confirm that these are separate economic streams with separate legal bases — the PPA is profit participation, the license is IP compensation. No double-counting.
