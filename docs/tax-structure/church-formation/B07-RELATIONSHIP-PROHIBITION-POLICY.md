## Preamble

*The Value of Truth (Satya) and the Ethic of Integrity demand that those who govern the Church of the Living Light do so without hidden entanglements. Truth is not only what we speak — it is what we structure. Integrity is not only what we profess — it is what we enforce.*

*The Spiritual Council exists to steward a sacred mission. That mission requires clarity of judgment, independence of thought, and freedom from the quiet gravitational pull of romantic attachment between those who hold governance authority. This is not a policy born of suspicion. It is a policy born of reverence — reverence for the mission, reverence for the people the Church serves, and reverence for the council members themselves, who deserve to govern without the weight of unspoken entanglements distorting the room.*

*No deception. No hidden relationships. No converting a seat of sacred trust into a platform for personal connection. The Living Light illuminates — and what is illuminated is free.*

## SECTION 1 — THE RULE

### 1.1 Prohibition

No two members of the Spiritual Council may be in a romantic, dating, or domestic partnership relationship with each other. This prohibition applies regardless of when the relationship began, how it is characterized, or whether the parties consider it public or private.

### 1.2 Definitions

For purposes of this policy:

(a) **Romantic relationship** means any relationship involving romantic interest, emotional intimacy of a romantic nature, sexual involvement, or the mutual understanding that the parties are "dating," "together," or "in a relationship" — whether or not the relationship has been publicly disclosed.

(b) **Domestic partnership** means cohabitation with a person in a relationship that resembles a marriage or committed partnership, regardless of whether a legal domestic partnership or marriage has been formalized.

(c) **Council member** means any person currently serving on the Spiritual Council, including the Senior Pastor, the Co-Founder, and all appointed members.

### 1.3 Scope

This prohibition applies to relationships between any two Council members, including but not limited to:

- Two non-founder Council members
- A non-founder Council member and the Senior Pastor
- A non-founder Council member and the Co-Founder

---

## SECTION 2 — THE SOLE EXCEPTION

### 2.1 Co-Founders' Marriage at Formation

The marriage of **Daniel Lawless** (Senior Pastor) and **Jennifer Lawless** (Co-Founder) at the time of the Church's founding is acknowledged and exempt from the prohibition set forth in Section 1.

This exception exists because the Church of the Living Light was born from their union. The mission and the marriage are of one root. To retroactively prohibit the relationship that gave rise to the Church itself would contradict the foundational truth of its origin.

### 2.2 Termination of Exception

If the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder are no longer married — by divorce, annulment, or legal dissolution — the exception in Section 2.1 **terminates immediately**. Upon termination:

(a) Both the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder become subject to the prohibition in Section 1 with respect to all other Council members;

(b) Neither the Senior Pastor nor the Co-Founder is required to resign as a result of the termination of this exception — the exception pertained to their relationship with each other, and that relationship has ended;

(c) All other provisions of this policy apply to both the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder going forward;

(d) The New Spouse Veto (B08) becomes operative — see [B09 Separation Clause Documentation](./B09-SEPARATION-CLAUSE-DOCUMENTATION.md) for full treatment.

### 2.3 No Other Exceptions

No other exception shall be granted to the prohibition in Section 1 for any reason, including but not limited to: the length of a Council member's service, the perceived benefit of the relationship to the Church, or the consent of other Council members. The prohibition is categorical.

---

## SECTION 3 — COMPLIANCE: THE 30-DAY WINDOW

### 3.1 Disclosure Obligation

If a romantic relationship develops between any two Council members — or if an existing relationship becomes known to any Council member — the involved parties have an affirmative duty to disclose the relationship to the full Spiritual Council within seven (7) calendar days of commencement or discovery.

### 3.2 The 30-Day Window

Upon disclosure — or upon the relationship becoming known to the Council by any means — one of the following must occur within thirty (30) calendar days:

**(a) The relationship ends.** Both parties provide written confirmation to the Council Secretary that the romantic relationship has concluded. Both parties remain on the Council. No further action is required.

**OR**

**(b) One party voluntarily resigns.** One of the involved parties submits a written resignation from the Spiritual Council to the Council Secretary. The resignation is effective immediately upon delivery. The remaining party continues to serve.

### 3.3 Determination of "Becoming Known"

The thirty-day period begins on the earliest of:

(a) The date on which either party discloses the relationship to the Council;

(b) The date on which the Council Secretary receives a written statement from any Council member asserting knowledge of the relationship;

(c) The date on which the relationship is discussed at a duly noticed Council meeting.

The Council is not required to investigate rumors. The thirty-day period is triggered only by actual disclosure or actual knowledge as defined above.

### 3.4 Good Faith

This policy recognizes that relationships are complex and that human beings deserve dignity in difficult situations. The thirty-day window exists to allow time for a considered decision — not to create a surveillance apparatus. The expectation is good faith compliance, not punitive enforcement.

---

## SECTION 4 — FAILURE TO COMPLY

### 4.1 Grounds for Removal

Failure to comply with Section 3 within the thirty-day window constitutes **"Violation of the relationship provision"** — an enumerated cause for removal under Article III, Section 4(b) of the Church Bylaws and [B06 For-Cause Removal Procedures](./B06-FOR-CAUSE-REMOVAL-PROCEDURES.md).

### 4.2 Process

If the thirty-day window expires without compliance:

(a) The Council Secretary shall document the noncompliance in writing;

(b) The Senior Pastor (or the Co-Founder, if the Senior Pastor is one of the involved parties) shall initiate for-cause removal proceedings under B06;

(c) Written notice of proposed removal is delivered to both involved Council members, identifying the specific violation;

(d) Each member has fourteen (14) calendar days to respond in writing;

(e) The Spiritual Council meets to hear both sides;

(f) Vote: **five (5) of seven (7)** Council members required for removal. The member subject to removal does not vote (effective threshold: 5 of 6 voting members);

(g) If removal is approved, it is effective immediately. The vacancy is filled through the standard Nominations Committee process.

### 4.3 Both Parties Subject to Proceedings

If neither party ends the relationship nor resigns within the thirty-day window, removal proceedings may be initiated against **both** involved Council members simultaneously. Each member's removal is voted on separately.

### 4.4 Post-Pause Cooling Off

During the one-year post-Governance Pause cooling off period (Article IIB, Section 6), the Senior Pastor may not initiate removal proceedings under this policy unless the violation also constitutes criminal conduct or breach of fiduciary duty. The Co-Founder or any two Council members may initiate proceedings during this period.

---

## SECTION 5 — RE-NOMINATION PATHWAY

### 5.1 Eligibility

A Council member who voluntarily resigns under Section 3.2(b) is not permanently barred from the Spiritual Council. The resignation addresses the governance conflict — it does not erase the individual's qualifications or contributions.

### 5.2 Standard Process

A resigned member may be re-nominated to the Spiritual Council through the standard Nominations Committee process:

(a) Nomination originates from the Nominations Committee, chaired by the Senior Pastor;

(b) The Senior Pastor's affirmative nomination is required;

(c) Confirmation by majority vote of the Spiritual Council;

(d) The resigned member must sign a new Relationship Prohibition Acknowledgment (Section 8) upon re-appointment.

### 5.3 New Spouse Veto Trigger

If the resigned member is or has become a romantic partner of the **Senior Pastor** or the **Co-Founder**, the New Spouse Veto ([B08](./B08-NEW-SPOUSE-VETO-AGREEMENT.md)) applies in addition to the standard process. Specifically:

(a) **Both** the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder must provide prior written consent before the nomination may proceed;

(b) The Nominations Committee may not advance the nomination without both written consents on file;

(c) This requirement applies regardless of whether the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder are married to each other at the time of the nomination.

## SECTION 6 — WHY THIS MATTERS

*The Spiritual Council is not a social gathering. It is a governing body entrusted with the stewardship of a sacred mission — a mission that serves real people, manages real resources, and carries real spiritual weight.*

*Romantic entanglements between board members create predictable governance risks:*

- **Compromised independence.** Partners naturally align — in perspective, in votes, in priorities. What appears as consensus may in fact be the gravity of intimacy distorting the judgment of two seats rather than one.

- **Factional dynamics.** A romantic pair on a seven-member board can function as an unacknowledged voting bloc, shifting the balance of power in ways that are invisible to the rest of the Council.

- **Conflicts of interest.** Compensation decisions, removal proceedings, role assignments — every governance action is shadowed when two members share a bed and a board seat.

- **Personal fallout becoming institutional crisis.** Relationships end. When they end between two board members, the Church inherits the wreckage — the awkward meetings, the retaliatory votes, the whispered side conversations, the eventual departure of one or both members.

- **Conversion of governance seats into personal platforms.** After a potential change in marital status between the Co-Founders, this policy prevents either from using their nomination power or governance authority to install a new partner on the board without accountability.

*This policy does not judge relationships. It protects governance. It protects the mission. And it protects the Council members themselves — from the impossible position of trying to serve both a sacred institution and a romantic partner who sits across the table.*

---

## SECTION 7 — MUTUAL AMENDMENT LOCK

### 7.1 Amendment Requirement

This policy — and Article III, Section 7 of the Church Bylaws from which it derives — may not be amended, modified, suspended, or repealed without the prior **written consent of both:**

- **Daniel Lawless** (Senior Pastor)
- **Jennifer Lawless** (Co-Founder)

### 7.2 Self-Protecting Provision

This Section 7 protects itself. It may not be amended without the prior written consent of both the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder.

### 7.3 Rationale

The mutual amendment lock ensures that neither Co-Founder can unilaterally weaken the prohibition. Both built this governance structure together. Both must consent to change it. This is a covenant between equals — a shared commitment that the governance of this Church will remain free from the entanglements this policy addresses.

---

## SECTION 8 — ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM

Each Council member shall sign the following acknowledgment at the time of appointment or re-appointment to the Spiritual Council. The signed acknowledgment shall be filed with the Council Secretary and maintained in the Church's permanent records.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Outright prohibition vs. conflict-of-interest framing:** Is an absolute ban on romantic relationships between board members enforceable under [state] nonprofit corporation law? Counsel should evaluate whether framing this as a conflict-of-interest policy with mandatory recusal, disclosure, and resignation triggers would be more defensible than a categorical prohibition — while achieving the same operational result.

2. **Due process in the 30-day window:** Does the thirty-day compliance period provide sufficient due process? Should the policy include a formal hearing or mediation step before triggering removal proceedings?

3. **Definition of "romantic relationship":** Is the definition in Section 1.2 sufficiently precise to avoid disputes over whether a relationship qualifies? Should the definition include a "reasonable person" standard or defer to Council determination?

4. **State employment law intersection:** If Council members receive stipends or compensation, could this prohibition be challenged under state employment discrimination laws? The religious organization exemption (Title VII, Section 702) likely provides protection, but counsel should confirm under [state] law.

5. **First Amendment protection:** The ministerial exception (*Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC*, 2012; *Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru*, 2020) protects religious organizations' employment decisions regarding ministers. Does this extend to governance-level relationship policies for board members who also serve in ministry roles?

6. **Enforceability of mutual amendment lock:** Can two individuals bind a future board from amending bylaws provisions? Religious corporation statutes may provide broader latitude than general nonprofit law. Counsel should confirm enforceability under [state] law.

7. **Acknowledgment form adequacy:** Is the acknowledgment form sufficient as a binding agreement, or should it be structured as a standalone contract with consideration, severability, and governing law provisions?
