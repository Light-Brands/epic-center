## Preamble

*This Church was built by two souls who chose to build together. That choice — Daniel's and Jennifer's — is the root from which every governance structure grows.*

*The New Spouse Veto is not about control. It is about mutual respect. It is about the recognition that when two people build something sacred together, neither should be able to unilaterally alter the composition of the governing body by installing a new romantic partner — without the other's knowledge, without the other's voice, without the other's consent.*

*This provision speaks to the deepest ethic of this Church: Consent. No one is coerced. No one is overridden. Every covenant is freely entered, and the composition of the Spiritual Council — the body that stewards the mission — is too important to be reshaped by romance alone.*

*Whether Daniel and Jennifer remain married or not, this mutual safeguard endures. Because the mission endures. And the mission belongs to both of them.*

## SECTION 1 — THE PROVISION

### 1.1 The Rule

No spouse, domestic partner, or romantic partner of the **Senior Pastor** or the **Co-Founder** may be appointed to the Spiritual Council without the prior written consent of **both** the Senior Pastor **and** the Co-Founder.

### 1.2 Full Text (as enacted in Bylaws Article III, Section 8)

> "No spouse, domestic partner, or romantic partner of the Senior Pastor or the Co-Founder may be appointed to the Spiritual Council without the prior written consent of both the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder. This provision applies regardless of the marital status of the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder to each other. If one Co-Founder has passed away, this provision ceases to apply. The surviving Co-Founder follows the normal Nominations Committee process. This provision may not be amended without the prior written consent of both the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder."

### 1.3 Definitions

For purposes of this agreement:

(a) **Spouse** means a person legally married to the Senior Pastor or the Co-Founder under the laws of any jurisdiction.

(b) **Domestic partner** means a person in a committed cohabiting relationship with the Senior Pastor or the Co-Founder, regardless of whether a legal domestic partnership has been formalized.

(c) **Romantic partner** means a person in a romantic or dating relationship with the Senior Pastor or the Co-Founder, regardless of whether the relationship involves cohabitation or legal formalization.

(d) **Senior Pastor** means Daniel Lawless or any successor Senior Pastor, but the mutual consent requirement applies only during the lifetimes of both original Co-Founders (Daniel Lawless and Jennifer Lawless).

(e) **Co-Founder** means Jennifer Lawless. The title of Co-Founder is personal and permanent — it does not transfer to a successor.

---

## SECTION 2 — APPLICABILITY

### 2.1 Regardless of Marital Status

This provision applies **regardless** of whether the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder are married to each other, separated, divorced, or have never been married. The mutual veto right is a governance protection — it is not contingent on the personal relationship between the Co-Founders.

### 2.2 When the Veto Becomes Most Important

While the Co-Founders are married, the practical likelihood of either seeking to place a new romantic partner on the Council is low. The veto provision is largely dormant during the marriage.

If the Co-Founders are no longer married, the veto becomes **operative** — this is precisely the scenario it was designed to address. See [B09 Separation Clause Documentation](./B09-SEPARATION-CLAUSE-DOCUMENTATION.md), which documents the activation of this provision upon change in marital status.

### 2.3 Cessation Upon Death

If one Co-Founder has passed away, this provision ceases to apply. The surviving Co-Founder follows the normal Nominations Committee process for all Council appointments, including appointments of the surviving Co-Founder's own romantic partners.

**Rationale:** The mutual veto exists to protect *both* Co-Founders' interests in the composition of the governing body. When one Co-Founder has passed, the mutual dimension no longer exists. The surviving Co-Founder retains all other governance protections (life tenure, amendment lock, etc.) but is no longer constrained by a veto that can no longer be exercised bilaterally.

## SECTION 3 — SCENARIO TABLE

The following table illustrates the operation of this provision across foreseeable scenarios.

| Scenario | Daniel's Consent | Jennifer's Consent | Result |
|----------|:---:|:---:|--------|
| Daniel wants his new partner on the Council | N/A (proposing) | **Required** | If Jennifer consents in writing, nomination proceeds through standard Nominations Committee process. If Jennifer does not consent, nomination **may not proceed**. |
| Jennifer wants her new partner on the Council | **Required** | N/A (proposing) | If Daniel consents in writing, nomination proceeds through standard Nominations Committee process. If Daniel does not consent, nomination **may not proceed**. |
| Both Co-Founders have new partners; both consent to each other's partner | Gives consent | Gives consent | Both nominations may proceed through standard process (subject to available seats and Council confirmation vote) |
| Both Co-Founders have new partners; Daniel consents to Jennifer's, Jennifer does not consent to Daniel's | Gives consent | Withholds consent | Jennifer's partner may be nominated. Daniel's partner **may not** be nominated. |
| Both Co-Founders have new partners; Jennifer consents to Daniel's, Daniel does not consent to Jennifer's | Withholds consent | Gives consent | Daniel's partner may be nominated. Jennifer's partner **may not** be nominated. |
| Neither Co-Founder consents to the other's partner | Withholds consent | Withholds consent | Neither partner may be nominated. |
| One Co-Founder has passed away | N/A | N/A | Provision **ceases entirely**. Surviving Co-Founder follows normal Nominations Committee process. |

### 3.1 Important Clarifications

(a) **Consent is for Council appointment only.** This provision does not restrict either Co-Founder's personal relationships. It restricts only the appointment of romantic partners to the Spiritual Council.

(b) **Consent does not guarantee appointment.** Even if both Co-Founders consent, the nominee must still be nominated through the Nominations Committee, receive the Senior Pastor's affirmative nomination, and be confirmed by majority vote of the Spiritual Council.

(c) **Consent may be given or withheld for any reason.** Neither Co-Founder is required to state a reason for withholding consent. The veto is absolute within its scope.

(d) **Consent is partner-specific.** Consent to one partner's appointment does not constitute consent to any future partner's appointment. Each nomination requires fresh written consent.

---

## SECTION 4 — CONSENT PROCESS

### 4.1 Written Notice

The Co-Founder proposing a partner's nomination shall provide written notice to the other Co-Founder, identifying:

(a) The name of the proposed nominee;

(b) The relationship between the proposing Co-Founder and the nominee;

(c) A statement that the proposing Co-Founder is requesting the other's written consent under this provision.

### 4.2 Response Period

The Co-Founder receiving notice shall have thirty (30) calendar days to respond in writing — either consenting or withholding consent. If no written response is received within thirty days, consent is deemed **withheld**.

### 4.3 Form of Consent

Consent must be in writing, signed by the consenting Co-Founder, and filed with the Council Secretary. Electronic signature is acceptable if it meets the requirements of [state] electronic signature law.

### 4.4 Irrevocability

Once written consent is given for a specific nominee and that nominee is appointed to the Council, the consent may not be retroactively revoked to remove the appointed member. The appointed member serves subject to the same terms as all other Council members (three-year renewable terms, for-cause removal under Article III, Section 4).

### 4.5 No Obligation to Negotiate

Neither Co-Founder is obligated to negotiate, discuss, or explain a decision to withhold consent. The veto is a governance right, not a negotiation. However, the Ethic of Integrity encourages honest communication — and the spirit of this provision assumes that both Co-Founders will exercise their rights in good faith and in service to the mission.

## SECTION 5 — INTERACTION WITH OTHER PROVISIONS

### 5.1 Relationship Prohibition (B07)

If a Council member resigns under the Relationship Prohibition Policy because the member has formed a romantic relationship with the Senior Pastor or the Co-Founder, and that member later seeks re-nomination:

(a) The standard Nominations Committee process applies;

(b) **In addition**, the New Spouse Veto applies — both Co-Founders must consent in writing before the nomination may proceed;

(c) Both requirements must be satisfied. Neither alone is sufficient.

### 5.2 Separation Clause (B09)

Upon any change in the Co-Founders' marital status, the New Spouse Veto moves from dormant to **active**. The [B09 Separation Clause Documentation](./B09-SEPARATION-CLAUSE-DOCUMENTATION.md) explicitly identifies this activation. All other governance protections continue unaltered.

### 5.3 Co-Founder Protections (B04)

The Co-Founder Acknowledgment ([B04](./B04-CO-FOUNDER-PROTECTIONS-ACKNOWLEDGMENT.md)) formally recognizes the Co-Founder's acceptance of all governance protections, including the mutual veto right established by this provision. The acknowledgment confirms that the Co-Founder understands both the protection the veto provides and the restraint it imposes.

### 5.4 Nominations Committee

The Nominations Committee (Article VII, Section 1 of the Bylaws) may not advance any nomination that is subject to this provision without both written consents on file. The Council Secretary shall verify compliance before any nominee subject to this provision is placed on the Council agenda for confirmation vote.

---

## SECTION 6 — INCAPACITY

### 6.1 Temporary Incapacity

If one Co-Founder is temporarily unable to provide written consent due to illness, injury, or other temporary incapacity:

(a) The nomination is held in abeyance until the incapacitated Co-Founder is able to respond;

(b) The thirty-day response period (Section 4.2) is tolled during the period of incapacity;

(c) Temporary incapacity does not constitute a waiver of the veto right.

### 6.2 Permanent Incapacity

If one Co-Founder is permanently incapacitated — as certified by two (2) licensed physicians pursuant to the standards set forth in Article II, Section 3(c) and Article IIA, Section 2(c) of the Bylaws:

(a) The permanently incapacitated Co-Founder is deemed unable to exercise the veto right;

(b) **Counsel should advise** on whether permanent incapacity should be treated as equivalent to death (provision ceases) or whether a surrogate decision-maker (e.g., healthcare proxy, legal guardian) should be authorized to exercise the veto on behalf of the incapacitated Co-Founder;

(c) Until counsel provides guidance, the conservative position is that the provision remains in effect and the nomination may not proceed without resolution.

### 6.3 Counsel Question

The treatment of permanent incapacity is a critical open question. If one Co-Founder is permanently incapacitated but alive, the provision as drafted neither ceases (cessation requires death) nor can it be exercised (the incapacitated person cannot consent or withhold). This creates a potential deadlock. Counsel must address this gap before formation.

## SECTION 7 — MUTUAL AMENDMENT LOCK

### 7.1 Amendment Requirement

This agreement — and Article III, Section 8 of the Church Bylaws from which it derives — may not be amended, modified, suspended, or repealed without the prior **written consent of both:**

- **Daniel Lawless** (Senior Pastor)
- **Jennifer Lawless** (Co-Founder)

### 7.2 Self-Protecting Provision

This Section 7 protects itself. It may not be amended without the prior written consent of both the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder.

### 7.3 Rationale

*The mutual amendment lock is the covenant beneath the covenant. It ensures that the veto cannot be dismantled by one party acting alone — no matter how much time has passed, no matter how the personal circumstances have changed. The rules of this house were set by two builders, and only two builders may change them.*

---

## SECTION 8 — WRITTEN CONSENT FORM TEMPLATE

The following form shall be used when a Co-Founder provides written consent under this provision. Completed forms shall be filed with the Council Secretary and maintained in the Church's permanent records.

## SECTION 9 — SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION

*The Ethic of Consent is the fourth of the Seven Divine Ethics: "No one is coerced. No one is manipulated. Every covenant, every commitment, every offering is freely given."*

*This provision embodies that ethic at the highest level of governance. The appointment of a romantic partner to a governing board is not inherently wrong — but it is inherently consequential. And consequential decisions deserve the safeguard of mutual consent.*

*Daniel and Jennifer built this Church together. They built these protections together. And they agreed — freely, as equals, in full knowledge of what the future might hold — that neither would reshape the governing body with a new partner without the other's voice in the room.*

*This is not restriction. It is reverence for what they built. The mission is sacred. The board is its steward. And the steward is too important to be remade by one voice alone.*

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Perpetual veto enforceability:** Is a mutual veto that survives divorce and persists for the lifetimes of both Co-Founders enforceable under [state] nonprofit corporation law? Could a court find that a perpetual veto on board composition constitutes an unreasonable restraint on governance?

2. **Incapacity gap:** The provision ceases upon death but is silent on permanent incapacity. Counsel must draft language addressing the scenario where one Co-Founder is permanently incapacitated but alive. Options include: (a) treat permanent incapacity as equivalent to death; (b) authorize a legal guardian or healthcare proxy to exercise the veto; (c) create a judicial mechanism for overriding a deadlocked veto.

3. **"Romantic partner" definition breadth:** The definition of "romantic partner" is intentionally broad. Could this breadth create enforcement challenges? Should a "reasonable person" standard or a Council determination mechanism be included?

4. **Antitrust / restraint of trade analogy:** While nonprofit boards are not subject to antitrust law, a perpetual veto on board composition may raise questions of fiduciary duty. Does either Co-Founder's veto right conflict with their fiduciary duty to the Church to compose the best possible board?

5. **First Amendment protection:** The Church's status as a religious organization provides substantial protection against civil court interference in governance composition. Counsel should confirm that the veto provision falls within the scope of ecclesiastical autonomy protected by the First Amendment and the ministerial exception doctrine.

6. **State-specific director appointment statutes:** Some states have statutory provisions governing director appointment that may limit or supersede bylaws provisions. Counsel should confirm that the mutual veto is not preempted by [state] nonprofit corporation law.

7. **Electronic signature validity:** Section 4.3 permits electronic signatures. Counsel should confirm that [state] recognizes electronic signatures for corporate governance documents of this nature.

*Draft framework for counsel review. Not legal advice.*
