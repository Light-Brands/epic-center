## Spiritual Preamble

*Build for the seventh generation.*

*That is the fifth Stewardship Principle of this church, and it is the lens through which every charitable program in this document was designed. We are not building programs that serve next quarter's metrics. We are building ministry that outlives us — ministry whose fruit will be harvested by people whose names we will never know.*

*The Divine Value of Unity teaches that the Living Light does not discriminate. The church gathers people across every boundary. But gathering is not enough. Unity demands that we extend beyond our walls — that we reach into communities where healing is needed most, where education is a luxury, where crisis has stripped away the illusion that anyone can do this alone.*

*The Church of the Living Light exists to heal, to teach, to gather, to serve, to ordain, and to steward. This document addresses the fourth of those callings: to serve. And we serve not because the IRS requires it — though genuine charitable activity is a compliance imperative for any church — but because service is who we are. It is the Law of Oneness expressed in action. When we serve another, we serve ourselves. When we lift a community, we lift the whole.*

*Daniel and Jennifer conceived these programs not as a compliance exercise, but as the outward expression of an inward conviction: that what has been given to us is not for us alone. Everything the Living Light touches belongs to everyone the Living Light reaches.*

*This is how we build for the seventh generation.*

## PART I — COMPLIANCE FOUNDATION

### Section 1. The Bright Line

Section 15 of the Governing Framework establishes the following bright line:

> **"Genuine charitable activity — Cannot exist solely to benefit founder."**

The Church of the Living Light **must** maintain genuine charitable activity proportional to its revenue. A church that receives substantial income — through Profit Participation Agreements, tithes, licensing royalties, or any other source — and channels that income exclusively or primarily to the personal benefit of its founders will not survive IRS scrutiny, regardless of the strength of its governance structure or the independence of its Compensation Committee.

Charitable programs are not optional. They are the evidence that this church exists for a purpose larger than the people who lead it.

### Section 2. Minimum Charitable Activity Guidelines

The Church shall allocate a meaningful percentage of its total annual revenue to charitable programs as defined in this document. The precise ratio shall be determined by the Spiritual Council on the advice of counsel, but the following guidelines apply:

(a) Charitable program expenditure shall be reviewed annually by the Finance Committee;

(b) The Spiritual Council shall document, in its annual meeting minutes, the total amount allocated to charitable programs and the ratio of charitable expenditure to total Church revenue;

(c) Counsel shall advise on the appropriate minimum ratio, taking into account the Church's size, maturity, and IRS expectations for churches of comparable revenue. [Counsel to advise on ratio to total revenue.]

### Section 3. Documentation Requirements for IRS Defense

For every charitable program, the Church shall maintain the following records:

| Record Type | Description | Retention Period |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Program logs** | Detailed records of each program event, service, or distribution — including date, location, participants served, and staff/volunteers involved | 7 years |
| **Beneficiary records** | Anonymous or de-identified records of individuals served — number of beneficiaries, demographics (where appropriate), services provided | 7 years |
| **Budget allocation** | Annual budget for each program, actual expenditure, variance analysis | 7 years |
| **Impact reports** | Qualitative and quantitative assessment of program outcomes | 7 years |
| **Volunteer records** | Hours contributed by volunteers, roles served, training provided | 7 years |

## PART II — CHARITABLE PROGRAMS

### Program 1 — Community Wellness Initiative

*Free and low-cost spiritual wellness programs for underserved communities*

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mission** | Extend the Church's healing ministry to communities that cannot access or afford spiritual wellness services — providing what the church teaches not as a product for sale, but as a gift freely given |
| **Target Population** | Underserved communities, low-income individuals, veterans, elderly, incarcerated or formerly incarcerated individuals |
| **Activities** | Free group meditation sessions, spiritual wellness workshops, healing circles, stress reduction programs, community prayer gatherings |
| **Delivery** | Local community centers, partner organizations, Church facilities, digital platforms (livestreamed and recorded for accessibility) |
| **Budget Allocation** | [To be set annually by Finance Committee] |
| **Metrics** | Number of sessions held per quarter; number of individuals served; participant feedback surveys; geographic reach |

### Program 2 — Educational Scholarships

*Spiritual education access for those who cannot afford it*

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mission** | Ensure that financial circumstance never prevents a sincere seeker from accessing the Church's educational offerings — because the Divine Value of Sovereignty means that every person's spiritual growth belongs to them, not to their bank account |
| **Target Population** | Individuals who demonstrate sincere interest in the Church's educational programs but lack the financial resources to participate |
| **Activities** | Full and partial scholarships for the ordination program, spiritual education courses, retreats, workshops, and conferences; textbook and materials stipends |
| **Selection** | Application-based; reviewed by the Director of Outreach & Programs (Nancy Courchesne) or designee; need-based with consideration of the applicant's demonstrated commitment to spiritual growth |
| **Budget Allocation** | [To be set annually by Finance Committee] |
| **Metrics** | Number of scholarships awarded; total dollar value of scholarships; completion rates of scholarship recipients; post-program engagement |

### Program 3 — Crisis Support Ministry

*Emergency assistance, counseling, and material support*

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mission** | Be present when people are most vulnerable — not with doctrine, but with care. The Law of Unconditional Love does not wait for the convenient moment. It meets people where they are. |
| **Target Population** | Church members and community members experiencing crisis — including but not limited to financial hardship, health emergencies, natural disasters, grief, family disruption, and spiritual crisis |
| **Activities** | Emergency financial assistance (rent, utilities, food, medical); pastoral crisis counseling; referral to professional services (mental health, legal aid, social services); crisis prayer support; bereavement support |
| **Delivery** | Direct pastoral outreach, partnership with local social services, church emergency fund disbursements |
| **Budget Allocation** | [To be set annually by Finance Committee — maintain a standing Crisis Fund] |
| **Metrics** | Number of individuals assisted; types of assistance provided; total disbursement from Crisis Fund; response time from request to assistance; follow-up engagement |

### Program 4 — International Mission

*Healing ministry in developing regions*

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mission** | Carry the Church's healing and educational ministry beyond national borders — because the Law of Oneness recognizes no geography. The Living Light is not American. It is universal. |
| **Target Population** | Communities in developing regions with limited access to spiritual wellness resources, education, and healing services |
| **Activities** | Mission trips for healing ministry and spiritual education; partnership with established international organizations; training local spiritual leaders; provision of educational materials in local languages; digital ministry outreach to international communities |
| **Delivery** | Annual mission trips (as Church revenue supports); ongoing digital ministry; partnerships with vetted international organizations |
| **Budget Allocation** | [To be set annually by Finance Committee — scaled to Church maturity and revenue] |
| **Metrics** | Number of mission trips per year; communities served; local leaders trained; materials distributed; ongoing partnerships established |

### Program 5 — Digital Ministry

*Free online spiritual content, worship services, and educational materials*

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mission** | Make the Church's spiritual teachings universally accessible — because geography, mobility, and circumstance should not determine who receives the Living Light. Stewardship Principle 4 teaches that technology serves spirit. This program is that principle in practice. |
| **Target Population** | Anyone, anywhere, who seeks the Church's spiritual teachings — with particular focus on those who cannot attend in-person services due to geography, disability, incarceration, or other barriers |
| **Activities** | Free livestreamed worship services; recorded teachings and devotionals available at no cost; digital study groups; online prayer community; free educational resources (written, audio, video); accessible formats for individuals with disabilities |
| **Delivery** | Church website, social media platforms, podcast distribution, video platforms, email ministry |
| **Budget Allocation** | [To be set annually by Finance Committee] |
| **Metrics** | Content published per month; total reach (views, downloads, listeners); geographic distribution of audience; engagement metrics; accessibility compliance |

(a) A summary of each charitable program's activities during the reporting year;

(b) Total expenditure per program and in aggregate;

The Finance Committee shall review charitable program budgets quarterly and report any material variances to the Spiritual Council.

### Section 6. Program Expansion

As the Church's revenue grows, charitable programs shall expand proportionally. The Spiritual Council shall evaluate the addition of new programs annually, considering:

(a) Community needs assessment;

(b) Available resources (financial, human, infrastructure);

(c) Alignment with the Church's mission and Statement of Faith;

(d) Capacity to document and measure impact;

(e) The imperative to maintain genuine charitable activity proportional to revenue.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Charitable expenditure ratio:** What percentage of total Church revenue should be allocated to charitable programs to satisfy the "genuine charitable activity" bright line? Is there a recognized safe harbor, or is this a facts-and-circumstances determination? Counsel should advise on a defensible minimum.
2. **Overlap with commercial activity:** Some charitable programs (e.g., Digital Ministry) overlap with content that may also be sold through Light Brands or other entities. How should the Church distinguish between charitable distribution and commercial licensing? Should there be a clear demarcation between free and paid content?
3. **International mission compliance:** Are there specific IRS rules governing a church's international charitable activities? Does the Church need to exercise expenditure responsibility (similar to 501(c)(3) rules) for international grants or partnerships?
4. **Beneficiary record privacy:** What level of beneficiary identification is required for IRS documentation purposes, and how does this interact with the Church's commitment to pastoral confidentiality? Can records be de-identified?
5. **Crisis Fund disbursement limits:** Are there per-individual or per-incident limits that should be established for Crisis Fund disbursements to avoid the appearance of private benefit?
