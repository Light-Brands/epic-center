## Preamble

We did not build this church alone. We built it together — a man and a woman who heard the same call and chose to answer it as one.

The Church of the Living Light exists because two souls recognized that the sacred is not separate from the world — it is woven through it. That healing is not a luxury — it is a birthright. That spiritual truth does not belong behind closed doors or beneath robes of authority. It belongs in the open, in the lived experience of every human being willing to receive it.

This is not a church born from institution. It is a church born from union — the union of two lives dedicated to something greater than themselves, and the union of ancient wisdom with the lived reality of modern existence.

We believe that the light within each person is not metaphor. It is the source. And everything we build — every service, every teaching, every act of stewardship — exists to help that light be seen, felt, and shared.

Daniel Lawless and Jennifer Lawless, Co-Founders

## I. The Living Light

We believe in the Living Light — the infinite, conscious, creative intelligence that underlies all existence. The Light is not distant or separate from creation. It is creation knowing itself. It is the source from which every soul emerges, the ground on which every life rests, and the home to which every spirit returns.

The Living Light is known by many names across traditions — God, Source, the Divine, the Absolute, Consciousness, the I AM. We honor all names and cling to none, because the Living Light transcends language while speaking through every language.

## II. The Sacred Laws

We believe the universe operates according to Sacred Laws — principles that govern the soul's journey through physical existence. These Laws are not rules imposed from above. They are the architecture of reality itself, discoverable through contemplation, experience, and surrender.

Among the Laws we hold foundational:

1. **The Law of Harmony** — All things seek balance. Where there is imbalance, there is suffering. Where there is harmony, there is peace. The church exists to restore harmony — within the individual, within relationships, within communities, and between humanity and the earth.

2. **The Law of Free Will** — Every soul has the sovereign right to choose its path. No teacher, no pastor, no institution may override the free will of another. The church guides. It does not compel.

3. **The Law of Oneness** — All beings are expressions of the same Living Light. Separation is illusion. When we serve another, we serve ourselves. When we harm another, we wound the whole. This Law is the foundation of all ministry.

4. **The Law of Unconditional Love** — Love without condition is the highest expression of the Living Light. It does not require worthiness. It does not demand reciprocity. It simply is. The church aspires to embody this Love in every interaction, every policy, and every act of care.

5. **The Law of Divine Order** — Nothing is random. Every experience serves the soul's evolution. The church trusts that even in chaos, there is a deeper order at work — and our role is not to control that order but to align with it.

6. **The Law of Commitment** — What we commit to, we become. The co-founders' commitment to each other and to this mission is not accidental — it is the Law of Commitment made visible. Every covenant within this church reflects this principle.

7. **The Law of Experience** — The soul learns through lived experience, not through doctrine alone. The church creates spaces for direct experience of the sacred — through healing, through worship, through community, through silence.

8. **The Law of Dharmic Direction** — Each soul carries a unique calling. Ordination in this church is not the conferring of authority — it is the recognition that a soul has heard its call and answered. The church supports every member in discovering and living their dharmic direction.

9. **The Law of Ritual** — Sacred practice anchors spiritual truth in the body and in community. Regular worship, intentional gathering, and ceremonial observance are not formalities — they are how the invisible becomes tangible.

## III. The Seven Divine Values

We hold seven values as the creed of our faith — the WHY behind everything we build:

1. **Truth (Satya)** — We speak what is real, even when it costs us. Truth is not opinion — it is the alignment of word, action, and intention with what is. The church is built on radical honesty with ourselves, with each other, and with the communities we serve.

2. **Love (Prema)** — Not sentiment. Not softness. Love as the active force of creation. Love that builds, that heals, that challenges, that holds. Love that refuses to look away from suffering and refuses to stop believing in transformation.

3. **Sovereignty (Svaraj)** — Every person who walks through our doors — physically or spiritually — is sovereign. We do not seek followers. We seek fellow travelers. The church empowers. It does not create dependency.

4. **Reverence (Shraddha)** — We approach the sacred with awe. We approach each other with respect. We approach the natural world with gratitude. Reverence is not weakness — it is the recognition that we stand in the presence of something greater than ourselves.

5. **Unity (Aikya)** — The church gathers people across every boundary — race, nationality, tradition, economic status, belief system. Unity does not require uniformity. It requires the willingness to see the Living Light in every face.

6. **Evolution (Vikas)** — We are not a church that clings to what was. We grow. We change. We shed what no longer serves. Evolution is sacred. The church supports the ongoing transformation of every soul it touches — including the institution itself.

7. **Grace (Kripa)** — We believe in the unearned gift. Grace is what remains when effort ends. It is the Living Light meeting us where we are — not where we think we should be. The church extends grace freely, because grace was freely given to us.

## IV. The Seven Divine Ethics

These are the HOW — the ethical principles that guide our conduct:

1. **Integrity** — We do what we say we will do. Our word is our bond. The governance of this church, the stewardship of its resources, the fulfillment of its promises — all rest on integrity.

2. **Transparency** — What is hidden festers. What is revealed heals. The church operates with openness in its governance, its financial stewardship, and its decision-making — not because the law requires it (it does not, for churches), but because our ethics demand it.

3. **Reciprocity** — Every relationship within this church is mutual exchange. The ministers serve the congregation. The congregation supports the ministry. The church compensates those who give their lives to this work — not as extraction, but as sacred reciprocity.

4. **Consent** — No one is coerced. No one is manipulated. Every covenant, every commitment, every offering is freely given. The church never takes what is not freely offered.

5. **Humility** — We are human. We may lose our way. The governance structures of this church — including the Governance Pause — exist because we believe in humility over certainty. The pause is not punishment. It is sacred space for realignment.

6. **Courage** — Speaking truth, making hard decisions, confronting injustice, admitting mistakes — all require courage. The church calls its leaders and its members to be brave, not comfortable.

7. **Stewardship** — Everything entrusted to this church — money, property, relationships, spiritual teachings, the trust of its members — is held in stewardship. We do not own these things. We tend them for those who come after us.

## V. The Seven Divine Morals — The NEVERs

These are the boundaries we will not cross:

1. **Never Deceive** — The church will not mislead its members, its community, its governing authorities, or itself. Deception is the antithesis of the Living Light.

2. **Never Exploit** — No person, no community, no resource will be exploited for the benefit of the church or its leaders. Compensation is reciprocity, not extraction. Ministry is service, not leverage.

3. **Never Coerce** — Faith cannot be forced. Tithes cannot be demanded. Obedience cannot be compelled. The church invites. It never coerces.

4. **Never Exclude** — The Living Light does not discriminate. The church welcomes all who come in genuine seeking — regardless of background, belief, identity, or circumstance.

5. **Never Desecrate** — The sacred is real. The church treats its spaces, its practices, its teachings, and the natural world with reverence. We do not profane what has been entrusted to us.

6. **Never Betray** — The trust placed in this church — by its members, its ministers, its co-founders, and the communities it serves — is sacred. Betrayal of trust is the gravest violation of our moral code.

7. **Never Stagnate** — Growth is sacred. The church that stops growing stops serving. We commit to continuous evolution — in our teachings, our practices, our governance, and our understanding.

## VI. The Stewardship Principles

Five foundational principles guide the church's approach to everything it builds, holds, and shares:

1. **Creation is Consecration** — Every act of creation within this church is an act of devotion. Whether we are drafting bylaws, building a worship space, writing curriculum, or designing a charitable program — the act of creation itself is sacred. We do not separate the administrative from the spiritual.

2. **Reciprocity is Law** — This is not metaphor. Reciprocity is the operating principle of every agreement, every compensation decision, every partnership. The church gives because the ministers serve. The ministers serve because the church supports. The congregation gives because the ministry nourishes. Fair exchange is the foundation.

3. **Truth Over Trend** — The church does not chase culture. It does not bend its theology to fit popular opinion. It does not compromise its principles for growth, relevance, or approval. Truth is timeless. Trends are not.

4. **Technology Serves Spirit** — The church embraces technology as a tool for expanding its mission — digital worship, online community, spiritual education platforms, AI-assisted ministry tools. But the technology serves the spirit, never the reverse. The tool does not become the master.

5. **Build for the Seventh Generation** — Every decision made by this church is measured not only by its immediate impact but by its legacy. Will this decision serve those who come seven generations after us? The church builds for permanence, not convenience.

## VII. The Divine Union

This church was founded by a man and a woman who chose each other before they chose this mission — and then realized the mission was inseparable from the choosing.

We believe the founding of the Church of the Living Light is an expression of divine union — two souls aligned in purpose, distinct in gifts, equal in commitment. Daniel carries the mantle of doctrinal vision and spiritual direction. Jennifer carries the mantle of worship, community, and pastoral care. Together, they hold the whole.

The governance structures of this church reflect this belief. Neither co-founder can be removed by the other. Neither can be diminished by the other. The protections embedded in the bylaws exist not because the co-founders fear each other, but because they trust each other enough to build something that survives even the most difficult personal transformation.

If the personal union transforms, the sacred union endures. The mission is bigger than the marriage. The call is louder than the circumstance.

## VIII. Ministry Mission

The Church of the Living Light exists to:

1. **Heal** — Provide spiritual wellness programs, healing retreats, and transformational experiences that address the whole person — body, mind, and spirit.

2. **Teach** — Create and distribute spiritual education content — devotionals, courses, workshops, digital media — that makes the Sacred Laws accessible to modern seekers.

3. **Gather** — Build community through regular worship services, small groups, online congregation, and in-person gatherings.

4. **Serve** — Operate charitable programs that extend the church's mission beyond its membership — community wellness initiatives, educational scholarships, crisis support, international mission work.

5. **Ordain** — Develop and maintain a structured ordination program that recognizes and empowers individuals called to spiritual leadership.

6. **Steward** — Manage the church's resources — financial, intellectual, physical, and spiritual — with integrity, transparency, and a commitment to the seventh generation.

## IX. Doctrinal Authority

The Senior Pastor is the sole and final authority on the interpretation of this Statement of Faith and all matters of doctrine, theology, spiritual direction, and ministry vision. This authority is a sacred trust, not a personal privilege.

The Senior Pastor exercises doctrinal authority in consultation with the Co-Founder on matters of worship, community ministry, and congregational care. This consultation is a commitment — not a constitutional limitation.

No Spiritual Council resolution, committee decision, or congregational vote may override the Senior Pastor's doctrinal determinations. This protection exists not to elevate one person above the community, but to ensure that the church's spiritual direction cannot be hijacked by governance procedure, factional politics, or external pressure.

Courts of law have no jurisdiction over the interpretation of this Statement of Faith. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the church's right to determine its own doctrine without governmental interference. (*Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich*, 1976; *Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC*, 2012.)

---

## X. Amendment

This Statement of Faith may be amended only by the Senior Pastor, acting in the Senior Pastor's capacity as final doctrinal authority. The Spiritual Council may recommend amendments, but the Senior Pastor's consent is required for any change to this document.

This provision itself may not be amended without the Senior Pastor's written consent.

---

*Draft framework for counsel review. The Statement of Faith is a living document that will evolve as the church grows, but its core principles — the Sacred Laws, the Divine Values, the Ethics, the Morals, and the founding union — are permanent.*
