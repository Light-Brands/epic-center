## State-Specific Notes for Counsel

| Item | Note |
|------|------|
| **State selection** | Counsel to advise on optimal state: Texas, Wyoming, Nevada, or other. Factors: nonprofit corporation statute flexibility, religious corporation protections, filing fees, privacy, and state AG oversight level. |
| **"Church" in name** | Some states require specific language or disclaimers for entities using "Church" in the name. Confirm requirements. |
| **Registered agent** | Must be located in the state of incorporation. If formation state differs from operating state, foreign qualification may be needed. |
| **Director terms** | State statute may impose requirements on director terms, removal thresholds, or indemnification scope. Bylaws provisions (life tenure, 5/7 removal) must be reconciled with state law. |
| **No-member structure** | Confirm that a no-member religious corporation is permissible under state law. Most states permit this for churches. |

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **State of incorporation:** Which state provides the strongest combination of (a) religious corporation protections, (b) flexible director tenure provisions (life tenure, irremovability), (c) minimal AG oversight, and (d) low filing costs?
2. **Life tenure enforceability:** Can the Senior Pastor and Co-Founder irremovability clauses be embedded in Articles (not just Bylaws) for maximum enforceability?
3. **Amendment lock in Articles:** Should the amendment lock provisions (requiring Senior Pastor and/or Co-Founder consent) be in the Articles themselves, or is the Bylaws location sufficient?
4. **Tax language:** Does the IRS language in Article IV need updating for post-2025 Code changes? Confirm Section 508(c)(1)(A) reference is current.
5. **Exhibit A (Statement of Faith):** Should the Statement of Faith be physically attached to the filed Articles, or incorporated by reference only?
