## Spiritual Preamble

*We built this together.*

*Not the way most people build things — not from a business plan, not from ambition, not from the desire to be seen. We built this from the place where two lives converged and recognized that what they carried alone, they were meant to carry together.*

*The Church of the Living Light was born in the space between Daniel's vision and Jennifer's devotion. It was conceived in late-night conversations and early-morning prayers. It was shaped by shared suffering, by the refusal to let fear dictate the terms of a calling, and by the quiet, persistent faith that what we were building would outlast us both.*

*These protections exist not because we fear each other, but because we trust each other enough to build something that survives even the most difficult personal transformation.*

*Sacred Law 6 — the Law of Commitment — teaches that what we commit to, we become. This document is the Law of Commitment made structural. It is the vow beneath the vow. It says: we honor what we have created, and we refuse to let the architecture of this sacred work be used as a weapon by either of us against the other.*

*Divine Value 3 — Sovereignty — teaches that every person is sovereign. Jennifer's sovereignty within this church is not derivative of her marriage. It is not contingent on Daniel's goodwill. It is foundational, permanent, and self-protecting.*

*This is the covenant. This is the document we read when we need to remember why we are doing this. Not for power. Not for control. For the mission. For the light. For everything we promised each other and everything we promised God.*

*Daniel Lawless and Jennifer Lawless, Co-Founders*

## PART I — PURPOSE AND RECITALS

### Section 1. Purpose

This Co-Founder Protections Acknowledgment (the "Acknowledgment") is a formal written instrument executed by Jennifer Lawless ("Co-Founder") and Daniel Lawless ("Senior Pastor") to confirm that the Co-Founder has been fully informed of, understands, and accepts the protections established in her favor under Article IIA of the Bylaws of the Church of the Living Light (the "Bylaws"), and that the Senior Pastor has reviewed and concurs with the completeness and accuracy of this enumeration.

### Section 2. Recitals

WHEREAS, the Church of the Living Light (the "Church") was co-founded by Daniel Lawless and Jennifer Lawless as an expression of their shared sacred mission;

WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the Church establish specific, enumerated protections for the Co-Founder that are irrevocable except as expressly provided therein;

WHEREAS, the Co-Founder's contributions to the founding, spiritual direction, and ongoing ministry of the Church are recognized as foundational and permanent;

WHEREAS, the Law of Commitment (Sacred Law 6) teaches that what we commit to, we become, and these protections are the structural expression of the co-founders' mutual commitment;

WHEREAS, the Divine Value of Sovereignty teaches that the Co-Founder's authority within the Church is inherent, not derived from or contingent upon any personal relationship;

NOW, THEREFORE, the Co-Founder and the Senior Pastor acknowledge and confirm the protections set forth below.

---

## PART II — ENUMERATION OF CO-FOUNDER PROTECTIONS

The following protections are established under Article IIA of the Bylaws and are individually and collectively irrevocable except as expressly provided in the Bylaws.

### Protection 1: Life Tenure on the Spiritual Council

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 2

The Co-Founder shall serve on the Spiritual Council for life or until voluntary resignation. Her tenure is not subject to term limits, periodic reconfirmation, or mandatory retirement.

The Co-Founder may be removed only by **unanimous vote of all Spiritual Council members** (excluding the Co-Founder from the vote) upon a documented finding of:

(a) Felony conviction in a court of law, after exhaustion of all appeals;

(b) Proven moral turpitude as determined by the Spiritual Council;

(c) Permanent physical or mental incapacity certified by two (2) licensed physicians, rendering her unable to perform the essential duties of the office for a period exceeding twelve (12) consecutive months.

The standard for removal of the Co-Founder is identical to the standard for removal of the Senior Pastor. Neither co-founder can be removed by the other under any lesser standard.

### Protection 2: Protected Role — Director of Worship & Community Life

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 3

The Co-Founder shall serve as **Director of Worship & Community Life**. This role encompasses:

- Leadership of worship services
- Congregational pastoral care
- Community outreach coordination
- Women's ministry
- Small group ministry
- Community events

This role, its title, scope, and ministry responsibilities may not be altered, diminished, merged, eliminated, or reassigned without the Co-Founder's prior written consent.

### Protection 3: Acting Senior Pastor Designation

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 4

In the event of a Governance Pause (Article IIB), the Co-Founder shall serve as **Acting Senior Pastor** for the duration of the pause. This designation is:

- **Structural** — it does not require a Council vote upon invocation of a pause
- **Automatic** — it activates upon any valid trigger of the Governance Pause
- **Separation-proof** — it survives any change in the marital status of the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder

The Acting Senior Pastor exercises the operational authority of the Senior Pastor as set forth in Article IIB, Section 4, including chairing Council meetings, making operational decisions, approving spending within the Senior Pastor's normal authority, leading or delegating worship services, and representing the Church on external boards.

The Acting Senior Pastor does not acquire the Senior Pastor's structural protections under Article II — she exercises operational authority under her own structural protections under Article IIA.

Detailed procedures for the Acting Senior Pastor role are set forth in [B05 Governance Pause Procedures](./B05-GOVERNANCE-PAUSE-PROCEDURES.md).

### Protection 4: Governance Pause Trigger Authority

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 5

The Co-Founder may invoke a Governance Pause by filing a written Concern with the Spiritual Council. The pause takes effect upon the concurrence of two (2) independent Council members.

This trigger authority:

- Is personal to the Co-Founder and cannot be delegated
- Requires only two (2) additional concurrences, not a full Council vote
- Survives any change in the marital status of the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder
- Cannot be revoked, suspended, or conditioned without the Co-Founder's written consent

### Protection 5: Compensation Protection

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 6

The Co-Founder's compensation, once established by the Compensation Committee, shall not be reduced, suspended, or terminated:

(a) Based on any change in the marital status of the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder;

(b) As retaliation for the Co-Founder's exercise of any right under Article IIA, including triggering a Governance Pause;

(c) As retaliation for the Co-Founder's vote on any Council matter.

The Compensation Committee shall review the Co-Founder's compensation on the same annual basis as all other staff, based on her role and Church revenue, without regard to her marital status.

This protection survives separation, divorce, or any other change in the personal relationship of the co-founders.

### Protection 6: Consultation Right

**Bylaws Reference:** Article II, Section 4 (third paragraph)

The Senior Pastor shall consult with the Co-Founder on matters of worship, community ministry, and congregational care before issuing doctrinal determinations in those areas. This consultation is advisory — the Senior Pastor retains final doctrinal authority. This consultation requirement:

- May not be waived or eliminated without the Co-Founder's written consent
- Applies to all doctrinal determinations that touch the Co-Founder's ministry area
- Is not a veto — it is a right to be heard before decisions are made in her domain
- Survives any change in the co-founders' marital status

### Protection 7: Nominations Committee Seat

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 7; Article VII, Section 1

The Co-Founder holds a permanent seat on the Nominations Committee. This seat:

- May not be removed or reassigned without the Co-Founder's written consent
- Gives the Co-Founder direct input into all Council nominations
- Operates alongside the Senior Pastor's chairmanship and veto power — the Co-Founder does not have a veto, but she has a voice and a vote on every nomination

### Protection 8: Amendment Lock

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 9; Article IX, Section 3

No provision of Article IIA (Co-Founder Protections) may be amended, modified, or repealed without the prior written consent of the Co-Founder (Jennifer Lawless).

This amendment lock:

- Protects every protection enumerated in this Acknowledgment
- Protects itself — the lock itself may not be amended without the Co-Founder's written consent
- Is independent of the Senior Pastor's amendment lock — both locks operate simultaneously on their respective provisions
- Cannot be circumvented by amending other Articles that reference Article IIA

---

## PART III — ENUMERATION OF MUTUAL PROTECTIONS

The following protections apply equally to both co-founders and require the written consent of **both** to amend.

### Mutual Protection 1: Neither Can Remove the Other

**Bylaws Reference:** Article II, Section 3; Article IIA, Section 2

Both co-founders serve with life tenure. Both may be removed only by unanimous vote of the remaining Council plus an extreme documented finding (felony, moral turpitude, permanent incapacity). The removal standard is identical for both. Neither co-founder may invoke the other's removal based on change in marital status or personal conflict.

### Mutual Protection 2: New Spouse Veto

**Bylaws Reference:** Article III, Section 8

No spouse, domestic partner, or romantic partner of either co-founder may be appointed to the Spiritual Council without the prior written consent of **both** the Senior Pastor **and** the Co-Founder. This provision:

- Applies regardless of the marital status of the co-founders to each other
- Prevents either co-founder from placing a new partner on the Council without the other's agreement
- Ceases to apply only upon the death of one co-founder (the surviving co-founder follows the normal Nominations Committee process)

Detailed procedures are set forth in [B08 New Spouse Veto Agreement](./B08-NEW-SPOUSE-VETO-AGREEMENT.md).

### Mutual Protection 3: Separation Clause

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IIA, Section 8

In the event that the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder are no longer married, **all** governance provisions, Council seats, protected roles, authority, compensation, and structural protections of each shall continue unaltered. Specifically:

| Protection | Status After Separation |
|------------|------------------------|
| Co-Founder's life tenure | Continues |
| Co-Founder's role (Director of Worship) | Continues — protected |
| Co-Founder's compensation | Continues — reviewed annually based on role and Church revenue |
| Co-Founder's Acting Senior Pastor designation | Continues |
| Co-Founder's Governance Pause trigger | Continues |
| Co-Founder's Nominations Committee seat | Continues |
| Co-Founder's amendment lock | Continues |
| Senior Pastor's life tenure | Continues |
| Senior Pastor's doctrinal authority | Continues |
| Senior Pastor's amendment lock | Continues |
| Neither party may invoke the other's removal based on marital status | Active |
| Co-Founder may vote on Senior Pastor's compensation | Yes (separate households — prior recusal was based on shared household benefit) |
| Intra-board relationship rule exception | Terminates — both subject to the prohibition |
| New Spouse Veto | Becomes operative — both must consent |

This provision may not be amended without the written consent of **both** the Senior Pastor **and** the Co-Founder.

Detailed documentation is set forth in [B09 Separation Clause Documentation](./B09-SEPARATION-CLAUSE-DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Mutual Protection 4: Mutual Amendment Lock

**Bylaws Reference:** Article IX, Section 4

The following provisions require the written consent of **both** co-founders to amend:

- Article III, Section 7 (Relationship Prohibition)
- Article III, Section 8 (New Spouse Veto)
- Article IIA, Section 8 (Separation Clause)

This mutual lock protects itself — it may not be amended without the written consent of both the Senior Pastor and the Co-Founder.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Enforceability of acknowledgment:** Does a signed acknowledgment of bylaws protections create additional legal rights beyond the bylaws themselves? Should this be structured as a standalone contract between the church and the Co-Founder, or is the bylaws provision sufficient?

2. **Consideration:** If structured as a contract, what is the consideration? The Co-Founder's ongoing service to the Church? Her forbearance from seeking additional protections? Counsel to advise on whether separate consideration is needed.

3. **Notarization requirements:** Does the state of incorporation require notarization for this type of governance acknowledgment? Is notarization advisable even if not required, for evidentiary purposes?

4. **Interaction with separation agreement:** If the co-founders divorce, could a marital settlement agreement override the bylaws protections acknowledged here? Should this Acknowledgment contain a waiver of the right to seek modification of these protections in any divorce proceeding?

5. **Third-party beneficiary:** Could a future council member argue that Jennifer's protections limit the council's governance authority and seek to challenge them? What is the standing analysis?

6. **Amendment lock durability:** Some states limit the ability of a nonprofit board to permanently entrench governance provisions. Does the amendment lock (requiring Jennifer's consent to amend Article IIA) survive a court challenge under state nonprofit corporation law?

7. **Witness qualifications:** Should the witnesses be Council members, or should they be independent third parties with no relationship to the Church? Counsel to advise on best practice.
