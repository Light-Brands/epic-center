## Purpose

This document is the **10% LBS variant** of D03. It covers the conditional 10% profit participation in Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC granted to Jason Sparks. The PPA is only executed if Jason elects Option C or D. If Jason assigns his PPA to the Church, the Church becomes the holder. All 14 Bulletproof Principles apply, modified as specified below. **For any term not listed as a delta, D03 controls.**

---

## Conditional Execution

| Element | Term |
|---------|------|
| **Condition precedent** | This PPA is executed only if Jason Sparks elects Option C or Option D under the founder compensation framework |
| **Election deadline** | Jason must elect by [Date] or such later date as the parties agree in writing |
| **If Option A or B** | This PPA is never executed. D05 does not exist as an enforceable agreement. |
| **If Option C** | Jason holds 10% PPA personally. Church is not a party unless Jason subsequently assigns. |
| **If Option D** | Jason irrevocably assigns 10% PPA to the Church. Church becomes holder. See [D02](./D02-PPA-ASSIGNMENT-JASON-TO-CHURCH.md). |

## 1. Parties (Delta from D03 Section 1)

| Party | Description |
|-------|------------|
| **The Holder** | Church of the Living Light (if Jason assigns per Option D), OR Jason Sparks, an individual resident of [State] (if Option C) |
| **LBS** | Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC, a Free Zone Limited Liability Company organized under the laws of the United Arab Emirates (Dubai Internet City) |

## 2. Principle 1: Profit Participation (Delta)

| Element | D03 Term | D05 Delta |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Participation percentage** | 30% of Distributable Profits | **10%** of Distributable Profits |
| **Calculation** | Same as 30% equity holder | Same as 10% equity holder — identical formula, different percentage |
| **Distribution frequency** | Quarterly, within 45 days | No change — follows D03 |
| **Currency** | USD or AED | No change — follows D03 |

---

## 3. Principle 2: Exit Participation (Delta)

| Element | D03 Term | D05 Delta |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Calculation** | 30% of Net Exit Proceeds | **10%** of Net Exit Proceeds |
| **No discount** | No minority/illiquidity discount | No change — follows D03. 10% holder is not subject to minority discount. |

**If LBS sells for $50M, the 10% holder receives $5M. Same time, same terms, same basis as equity.**

---

## 4. Principle 13: Governance Rights (Delta)

| Element | D03 Term | D05 Delta |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Board seat** | Church holds one seat on Board of Directors of LBS | **No board seat.** 10% participation does not entitle the holder to a board seat. |
| **Observer rights** | Included (in addition to board seat) | **Observer rights only.** Holder may attend all LBS board meetings as a non-voting observer. |
| **Veto rights** | Church has individual veto over sale/merger, new debt, related-party transactions, new PPA issuance, material business changes, executive compensation | **No individual veto rights.** 10% holder does not hold individual veto power. |
| **Collective veto** | Not applicable (30% holder has individual veto) | If the Church holds both D03 (30%) and D05 (10%), the combined 40% interest gives the Church collective veto power. The 40% threshold triggers enhanced protective provisions. |
| **Board materials** | Church representative receives all LBS board materials | Observer receives all board materials on same schedule as board members |

**Why no board seat at 10%:** Governance rights scale with economic participation. The 30% holder (D03) receives a board seat because 30% represents a significant minority interest. The 10% holder receives observer rights — full transparency without governance authority. If the Church holds both (40% combined), governance power is enhanced.

## 5. Vesting (Delta from D03 Section 6)

| Parameter | D03 Term | D05 Delta |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Vesting period** | 4 years from PPA effective date | 4 years from D05 effective date (**separate schedule from D03**) |
| **Cliff** | 1 year — 25% vests at 12 months | No change — follows D03 |
| **Monthly vesting** | Remaining 75% over 36 months | No change — follows D03 |
| **Acceleration** | Single-trigger on Change of Control | No change — follows D03 |
| **Independence** | N/A | Jason's vesting schedule is entirely independent of Daniel's. Daniel's vesting under D03 does not affect Jason's vesting under D05, and vice versa. |
| **Church assignment** | Vesting applies to Church as holder after assignment | If Option D: vesting applies to Church as holder after Jason's assignment. If Option C: vesting applies to Jason personally. |

---

## 6. Combined Interest Scenario

If the Church holds both D03 (30%) and D05 (10%), the following enhanced provisions apply:

| Element | D03 Alone (30%) | D03 + D05 Combined (40%) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Total participation** | 30% | 40% of Distributable Profits |
| **Board seats** | One (1) | One (1) — no additional board seat for 10% increment |
| **Veto power** | Individual veto per D03 Principle 13 | Enhanced — 40% collective interest strengthens veto position |
| **Drag-along threshold** | 75% of PPA interests | Church's 40% block gives effective veto over drag-along (since 75% cannot be reached without Church's consent if Church holds 40%) |
| **Anti-dilution** | Pro-rata at 30% | Pro-rata at 40% combined |

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Conditional execution mechanics:** How should the conditional nature of D05 be structured? Is it a standalone agreement executed only upon Jason's election, or an option agreement with exercise mechanics?
2. **Dual holder scenario:** If Jason holds D05 personally (Option C) and the Church holds D03, how do governance interactions work? Can Jason and the Church coordinate votes?
3. **Observer rights enforceability:** Are observer-only rights (no vote, no veto) enforceable under UAE/DIFC law? What remedies does an observer have if excluded from meetings?
4. **Collective veto mechanics:** If the Church holds 40% combined (D03 + D05), how is the collective veto exercised procedurally? Single resolution or separate votes per PPA?
5. **Separate vesting schedules:** Confirm that Jason's 4-year vesting under D05 is entirely independent of Daniel's vesting under D03. No cross-acceleration.
6. **Tax treatment — Jason personally:** If Jason holds D05 personally (Option C, no assignment to Church), what are the US tax implications? PPA income would be taxable to Jason as ordinary income or self-employment income.
7. **Tax treatment — Church as holder:** If Jason assigns to Church (Option D), confirm same UBIT-exempt treatment as D03.
