## Preamble

A church begins the moment its people gather with shared intention. But in the eyes of the law, it begins when the first meeting is called to order, the governing documents are adopted, and the stewards of the mission are named. This is that meeting.

The organizational meeting of the Church of the Living Light is the bridge between vision and form. Every resolution adopted here serves a single purpose: to create a structure worthy of the sacred work it will carry. The officers named today are not appointed to power — they are appointed to stewardship. The committees established today are not bureaucratic formalities — they are the mechanisms by which the church fulfills its covenant with the law and with the seventh generation.

These minutes are the church's first official record. They will be preserved permanently, referenced in every subsequent filing, and relied upon by every institution the church engages — the IRS, the banking system, the state of incorporation. They must be complete, accurate, and worthy of the mission they inaugurate.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Incorporator identity:** Who should serve as Incorporator? Options: (a) the attorney, (b) Daniel Lawless, (c) a neutral third party. Counsel to advise on whether the Incorporator should be someone other than the Senior Pastor to strengthen the formation narrative.
2. **Meeting format:** Can the organizational meeting be held by video conference under the state of incorporation's nonprofit corporation act? If so, what documentation of remote participation is required?
3. **Unanimous consent alternative:** Can the organizational meeting resolutions be adopted by unanimous written consent in lieu of a physical meeting? If so, does the state require specific language or formalities?
4. **PPA Assignment authorization:** Confirm that a board resolution is sufficient to authorize the church to accept the PPA assignment, or whether additional formalities are required (e.g., fairness opinion, independent valuation).
5. **Bank account resolution format:** Does the selected bank require its own form of corporate resolution, or will this resolution suffice? Obtain bank-specific forms in advance if required.
6. **State-specific requirements:** Confirm that no additional organizational actions are required under the state of incorporation's nonprofit corporation act (e.g., adoption of conflict of interest policy, initial registered agent filing, initial report).
