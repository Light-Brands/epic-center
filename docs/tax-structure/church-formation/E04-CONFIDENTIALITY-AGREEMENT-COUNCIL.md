## Spiritual Preamble

*Trust is the invisible architecture of everything we build.*

*The Spiritual Council holds the most sacred trust of this church — the trust of its members, its ministers, its co-founders, and the Living Light itself. The Council sees what no one else sees: the financial records that fund the mission, the deliberations that shape its direction, the compensation decisions that sustain its ministers, the governance proceedings that protect its integrity, and the pastoral confidences of its people.*

*The sixth Divine Moral — Never Betray — is the spiritual foundation of this Agreement. The trust placed in this church by its members, its ministers, its co-founders, and the communities it serves is sacred. Betrayal of trust is the gravest violation of our moral code.*

*This is not a document born from suspicion. It is born from the recognition that sacred work requires sacred containers. What is spoken in Council stays in Council — not because we fear transparency, but because confidentiality protects the people we serve. A member who shares their deepest struggle with a pastor must know that struggle will not become a Council discussion topic. A minister whose compensation is being reviewed must know that the amount will not appear in a text message. A co-founder navigating a Governance Pause must know that the proceedings will not be shared outside the room.*

*Every Council member signs this Agreement at appointment — not as a threat, but as a promise. A promise that says: I understand the weight of what I will carry, and I will carry it with reverence.*

## AGREEMENT

This Confidentiality Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between the **Church of the Living Light** (the "Church") and the undersigned member of the Spiritual Council (the "Council Member").

### Section 1. Purpose

This Agreement establishes the confidentiality obligations of all Spiritual Council members with respect to sensitive Church information encountered during their service. The Governing Framework, Section 4.6, identifies breach of confidentiality — defined as "unauthorized disclosure of church financial records, council deliberations, compensation decisions, or governance pause proceedings" — as an enumerated cause for removal from the Spiritual Council by 5/7 supermajority vote.

### Section 2. Confidential Information Defined

"Confidential Information" under this Agreement includes, but is not limited to:

(a) **Church financial records** — all financial statements, bank records, revenue reports, budget documents, tax filings, PPA distribution amounts, royalty payments, and any other financial information of the Church;

(b) **Council deliberations** — all discussions, debates, analyses, opinions, and reasoning expressed during Spiritual Council meetings, including executive sessions;

(c) **Compensation decisions** — all information relating to the compensation of any Church minister, staff member, or Council member, including salary amounts, housing allowance designations, retirement plan contributions, church-owned asset allocations, and the comparable data relied upon by the Compensation Committee;

(d) **Governance Pause proceedings** — all information relating to any Governance Pause, including the triggering event, the written Concern, the Council's deliberation, the affected person's response, and the outcome;

(e) **For-cause removal proceedings** — all information relating to any removal proceeding under Section 4.6 of the Governing Framework and the For-Cause Removal Procedures (B06), including the basis for the proposed removal, the member's response, and the Council's deliberation;

(f) **Member pastoral information** — any personal, spiritual, medical, financial, or family information shared by a Church member in a pastoral context that comes to the Council Member's attention through their service on the Council;

(g) **PPA distribution amounts** — specific distribution amounts under any Profit Participation Agreement between the Church and any entity, including Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC and Light Brands Consulting Ltd;

(h) **Any other information** designated as confidential by the Senior Pastor or by majority vote of the Spiritual Council.

### Section 3. Obligations

The Council Member agrees to:

(a) Hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence;

(b) Not disclose Confidential Information to any person who is not a current member of the Spiritual Council or authorized Church staff, except as permitted under Section 4;

(c) Not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than the fulfillment of the Council Member's duties on the Spiritual Council;

(d) Take reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized disclosure — including securing physical documents, protecting electronic communications, and refraining from discussing Confidential Information in public or unsecured settings;

(e) Return or destroy all Confidential Information in the Council Member's possession upon departure from the Spiritual Council, at the Church's direction.

### Section 4. Exceptions

The confidentiality obligations of this Agreement do not apply to information that:

(a) **Is required by law to be disclosed** — the Council Member may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by a valid statute, regulation, or legal process, provided that the Council Member shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide the Church with prior written notice of the required disclosure and cooperate with the Church in seeking a protective order or other limitation on the scope of disclosure;

(b) **Is required by court order** — the Council Member may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a valid court order or subpoena, subject to the same notice and cooperation obligations set forth in subsection (a);

(c) **Is already public** — information that is publicly available through no breach of this Agreement or any other confidentiality obligation owed to the Church.

### Section 5. Duration

The obligations of this Agreement shall remain in effect:

(a) During the entire period of the Council Member's service on the Spiritual Council; and

(b) For a period of **three (3) years** following the Council Member's departure from the Spiritual Council, whether by resignation, removal, expiration of term, or any other cause.

After the three-year post-service period, the Council Member's confidentiality obligations terminate, except with respect to member pastoral information, which shall remain confidential indefinitely.

### Section 6. Consequences of Breach

Breach of this Agreement constitutes **breach of confidentiality** as defined in Section 4.6 of the Governing Framework and the Bylaws. Breach of confidentiality is an enumerated cause for removal from the Spiritual Council by supermajority vote of five (5) of seven (7) Council members, pursuant to the For-Cause Removal Procedures (B06).

The Church further reserves the right to seek any legal remedies available under applicable law for breach of this Agreement, including injunctive relief and damages.

### Section 7. No Limitation on Legal Rights

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Council Member from:

(a) Reporting suspected illegal activity to any governmental authority;

(b) Cooperating with any governmental investigation or proceeding;

(c) Exercising any rights protected by applicable law.

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Enforceability as NDA:** Confirm that this Agreement is enforceable as a nondisclosure agreement under the law of the state of incorporation. Is consideration sufficient (service on the Council)? Should additional consideration be recited?
2. **Three-year post-service duration:** Is three (3) years a reasonable and enforceable duration for post-service confidentiality obligations? Some jurisdictions may impose limitations on the duration of NDAs. Counsel to advise on the maximum enforceable period.
3. **Pastoral information exception:** The Agreement provides that member pastoral information remains confidential indefinitely, even after the three-year post-service period. Is this enforceable? Does it create any conflict with the general termination of obligations?
4. **Whistleblower protections:** Confirm that Section 7 adequately preserves the Council Member's rights under applicable whistleblower and anti-retaliation statutes. Should specific statutes be referenced?
5. **Remedies for breach:** Beyond removal from the Council, what legal remedies are realistically available to the Church for breach? Is injunctive relief obtainable in the state of incorporation? Should liquidated damages be considered?
6. **Interaction with For-Cause Removal:** Confirm that a breach of this Agreement constitutes sufficient grounds for removal under the Bylaws and the For-Cause Removal Procedures, and that no additional showing is required beyond proving the unauthorized disclosure.
