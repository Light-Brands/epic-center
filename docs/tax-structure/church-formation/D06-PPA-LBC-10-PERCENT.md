## Purpose

This document combines the Cook Islands deltas of D04 with the 10%/conditional deltas of D05. It covers the conditional 10% profit participation in Light Brands Consulting Ltd (Cook Islands IBC) granted to Jason Sparks. The PPA is only executed if Jason elects Option C or D. All 14 Bulletproof Principles apply, modified as specified below. **For any term not listed as a delta, D03 controls. For Cook Islands-specific terms, D04 controls. For 10%/conditional terms, D05 controls.**

---

## Conditional Execution

Identical to D05. This PPA is executed only if Jason Sparks elects Option C or Option D. See [D05 Conditional Execution](./D05-PPA-LBS-10-PERCENT.md) for full terms.

## 2. Principle 13: Governance Rights (D06 Unique Delta)

This is the key area where D06 differs from both D04 and D05 individually.

| Element | D04 (LBC 30%) | D05 (LBS 10%) | D06 (LBC 10%) |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Board/Advisory seat** | Advisory Board seat (contractual) | No board seat; observer rights only | **No advisory board seat.** Advisory observer rights only. |
| **Observer rights** | Attends all LBC board and Advisory Board meetings | Attends all LBS board meetings as non-voting observer | Attends all LBC board and Advisory Board meetings as non-voting advisory observer |
| **Veto rights** | Individual veto via Advisory Board mechanism | No individual veto | No individual veto |
| **Collective veto** | N/A (30% has individual veto) | 40% combined with D03 gives collective veto in LBS | 40% combined with D04 gives collective veto in LBC |
| **Board materials** | Receives all materials | Observer receives all materials | Advisory observer receives all materials on same schedule |

**Why advisory observer (not advisory board seat):** D04's 30% holder gets an Advisory Board seat because 30% represents a significant minority interest justifying contractual governance authority over nominee directors. D06's 10% holder does not have sufficient economic weight to justify a seat on the Advisory Board itself. Observer rights provide full transparency without governance authority. If the Church holds both D04 (30%) and D06 (10%) = 40% combined in LBC, the Church's Advisory Board seat from D04 represents the full 40% interest.

---

## 3. Combined Interest Scenario — LBC

If the Church holds both D04 (30%) and D06 (10%), the following enhanced provisions apply within LBC:

| Element | D04 Alone (30%) | D04 + D06 Combined (40%) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Total participation** | 30% | 40% of Distributable Profits |
| **Advisory Board seats** | One (1) | One (1) — no additional seat for 10% increment |
| **Veto power** | Individual veto via Advisory Board | Enhanced — 40% collective interest strengthens veto position |
| **Anti-dilution** | Pro-rata at 30% | Pro-rata at 40% combined |

---

## 4. Cross-Entity Combined Interest

If the Church holds all four PPAs (D03 + D04 + D05 + D06), the total economic interest across both entities:

| Entity | D03/D05 (LBS) | D04/D06 (LBC) | Combined |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Daniel's PPAs** | 30% (D03) | 30% (D04) | 30% in each entity |
| **Jason's PPAs** | 10% (D05) | 10% (D06) | 10% in each entity |
| **Church total** | 40% of LBS | 40% of LBC | 40% in each entity |

## Counsel Review Notes

1. **Advisory observer vs. advisory board seat:** Is "advisory observer" a recognized role under Cook Islands law? What contractual language ensures the 10% holder receives board materials and meeting attendance rights without a formal seat?
2. **Combined governance mechanics:** If the Church holds both D04 (30%) and D06 (10%), does the Church's single Advisory Board seat (from D04) automatically represent the combined 40% interest? Or does D06's observer rights need to be separately exercised?
3. **Conditional execution under Cook Islands law:** How should the conditional nature of D06 be structured under Cook Islands law? Is an option agreement enforceable against nominee directors?
4. **Cross-entity coordination:** The Church may hold PPAs in both LBS (D03/D05) and LBC (D04/D06). Should there be a master coordination agreement that addresses cross-entity governance, or are the individual PPAs sufficient?
5. **Jason's personal holding in Cook Islands:** If Jason holds D06 personally (Option C), what are the Cook Islands filing or reporting obligations for a US person holding a PPA in a Cook Islands IBC? Form 5471 does not apply (PPA is not equity), but are there other disclosure requirements?
6. **Tax treatment consistency:** Confirm that the tax treatment analysis for Cook Islands distributions (D04 counsel notes) applies equally to a 10% PPA holder.
7. **Nominee director conflicts:** If the nominee directors of LBC are bound by the Advisory Board (D04/D10) but also have an advisory observer (D06), can there be conflicts in information rights or confidentiality?
