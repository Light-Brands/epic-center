## 1. TL;DR

**0.85-2.5% effective rate** via salary-first plus affordable dividends. A lifelong Cyprus resident (25+ years) is deemed domiciled — the favorable non-dom regime (0% SDC on dividends) does NOT apply. However, the 2026 reform dropped SDC on dividends from 17% to **5%**, making dividends affordable rather than punitive.

The **overseas employment exemption** — salary from a non-resident employer for work done outside Cyprus for more than 90 days — is **fully exempt from Cyprus income tax** regardless of domicile status. This is the primary tool.

## 3. Why Deemed Domiciled

The non-dom regime requires meeting ALL three tests. A 25+ year resident fails all of them:

| Test | Requirement | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Not resident for 17 of last 20 years? | Must have been non-resident for 4+ of last 20 years | **Fails** — resident for 20+ of 20 |
| Domicile of origin not Cyprus? | Must have been born/raised elsewhere | **Fails** — born in Cyprus |
| Acquired domicile of choice elsewhere? | Must have permanently relocated | **Fails** — never relocated |
| **Non-dom eligible?** | | **No** |

**Consequence:** SDC applies on dividends — now **5%** (was 17% pre-2026).

## 4. Four Paths Comparison

| | Path A: Salary-First | Path B: Dubai Reset | Path C: Full Dubai | Path D: Stay Put |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Where they live** | Cyprus (~230 days) + Dubai (~90 days) + travel | Dubai 4 years → Cyprus | Dubai (permanent) | Cyprus (full-time) |
| **Travel required** | 90+ days outside Cyprus/yr | 4 years abroad | Permanent relocation | None |
| **Salary tax** | **0%** (90-day rule) | **0%** (Dubai) → **0%** (90-day on return) | **0%** (Dubai) | **Up to 35%** (progressive) |
| **Dividend tax** | **~7.65%** (5% SDC + 2.65% GESY) | **0%** (Dubai) → **~2.65%** (non-dom) | **0%** | **~7.65%** |
| **Capital gains** | **0%** | **0%** | **0%** | **0%** |
| **Y5 effective rate** | **~0.85%** (salary-heavy) to **~2.5%** (balanced) | **0% → ~0.4%** | **0%** | **~18.1%** |
| **Lifestyle change** | Moderate — 3 months abroad | Major — 4 years in Dubai | Major — permanent | None |
| **Recommended?** | **Yes (best balance)** | If taking large dividends | Only if desired | Last resort |

## 5. Year 5 Tax Projections

### Salary-Heavy Split (Recommended)

| Income | Amount | Tax Treatment | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| UAE salary (work outside Cyprus >90 days) | $800,000 | 100% exempt — overseas employment exemption | **$0** |
| PIF distributions (kept modest) | $100,000 | 5% SDC ($5,000) + 2.65% GESY ($2,650) | **$7,650** |
| Capital gains | Variable | 0% on securities | **$0** |
| **Total on $900,000** | | | **$7,650 (0.85%)** |

### Balanced Split

| Income | Amount | Tax Treatment | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| UAE salary (work outside Cyprus >90 days) | $500,000 | 100% exempt | **$0** |
| PIF distributions | $400,000 | 5% SDC ($20,000) + 2.65% GESY ($2,650 — capped) | **$22,650** |
| **Total on $900,000** | | | **$22,650 (2.5%)** |

**Either split produces an excellent result.** The salary-heavy split saves ~$15K/year but requires maximizing the salary channel.

## 6. 2026 Reform Rates Reference

### SDC (Special Defence Contribution) — Domiciled Residents

| Income Type | 2026 Rate | Previous Rate | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dividends (post-2026 profits) | **5%** | 17% | **Reduced** |
| Dividends (pre-2026 profits, until Dec 31 2031) | **17%** | 17% | Unchanged |
| Rental income | **0% — abolished** | 3% on 75% gross | **Abolished** |
| Concealed dividends (new anti-avoidance) | **10%** | N/A | **New** |
| Interest | **Confirm with counsel** | 17% | May have changed |

### Other Key Rates

| Item | Rate |
|---|---|
| GESY (healthcare) on dividends | 2.65% (capped at EUR 180,000 income = EUR 4,770 max) |
| Cyprus corporate tax | **15%** (was 12.5% — OECD Pillar Two alignment) |
| Crypto-asset gains (Article 20E) | **8% flat** (ring-fenced, no carry-forward of losses) |
| Capital gains on securities | **0%** |
| Income tax on dividends | **0%** (dividends only subject to SDC + GESY, never income tax) |

### Cyprus-UAE Treaty WHT

| Payment | WHT Rate |
|---|---|
| Dividends (both directions) | **0%** |
| Interest | **0%** |
| Royalties | **0%** |

WHT is the border tax (0% treaty rate). SDC is the domestic tax on the resident's income after receipt. Both apply: 0% at the border + 5% SDC + 2.65% GESY on arrival.

## 7. Crypto: Doesn't Help

The 2026 reform introduced an 8% flat tax on crypto gains (Article 20E). The math:

| Channel | Effective Rate |
|---|---|
| Salary (90-day rule) | **0%** |
| Dividends (post-2026) | **~7.65%** |
| Crypto gains | **8%+** (possibly + GESY) |
| Concealed dividends (if crypto scheme used to extract value) | **10%+** |

Crypto is slightly MORE expensive than dividends. Creating tokens to replace dividend distributions adds cost, regulatory burden (MiCA), and risk of being classified as concealed dividends at 10% SDC. Build tokens for business value, not tax avoidance.

## 8. Implementation Checklist (Path A)

| Step | Detail | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Employment contract with UAE entity | Formal employment as executive/co-founder of TE Global Technology FZ-LLC | 1 week |
| 2. Plan annual travel schedule | 90+ days outside Cyprus: Dubai office time + Tulum visits + business travel | Ongoing |
| 3. Set up travel documentation | Boarding passes, hotel receipts, work calendars, timesheets. Keep a work diary. | From day 1 |
| 4. Set salary level | Strong salary ($500K-$800K) from UAE entity. Get counsel sign-off on reasonableness. | With counsel |
| 5. PIF beneficiary status (optional) | Can be added as PIF beneficiary. Distributions now affordable at 5% SDC. | 2-3 weeks |
| 6. Annual Cyprus tax filing | Declare salary (exempt under 90-day rule) and any dividends (SDC + GESY) | Annually |
| 7. Confirm 90-day exemption details with counsel | Does GESY apply to exempt salary? Interest SDC rate? PIF distribution classification? | Month 1 |

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **90-day exemption challenged** | Low-Medium | High — salary taxable at up to 35% | Meticulous travel records. Boarding passes, hotel receipts, work calendars. Employment contract clearly with UAE entity. |
| **Salary deemed unreasonable** | Low | Medium — portion recharacterized as dividend (now 5% SDC, less painful than before) | Set salary with reference to comparable executive compensation. Document role and time commitment. |
| **Concealed dividend classification** | Low-Medium | Medium — 10% SDC instead of 5% | Use standard channels (salary + formal dividends). No creative schemes. |
| **Non-dom reset challenged (Path B)** | Medium | Medium — 5% SDC applies (less painful than old 17%) | Establish genuine domicile of choice in Dubai. Buy/rent home. Sever some Cyprus ties. |
| **Further Cyprus tax reform** | Low | Variable | The 2026 reform was favorable. Cyprus has strong incentive to maintain competitive rates. |
| **UAE QFZP loss** | Medium | Medium — 9% UAE CT | Doesn't affect personal tax strategy directly. |
