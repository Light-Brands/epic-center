# TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman): The Investable Vehicle

> **Status:** Entity specification — requires Cayman counsel + UAE counsel + investor counsel validation
> **Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## 1. Summary

TE Wellness Holdings is a Cayman Islands Exempted Company that serves as the single investable vehicle for the TE healing center business. It owns all TE intellectual property, collects all TE revenue ($10.7M Y1 → $35.5M Y5), controls the Mexico OpCo, and licenses content to the Church of the Living Light. Panamanian Holdings S.A. (a Panama corporation 100% owned by the PIF) holds ~70% of equity; an investor holds ~30%. Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC (Dubai) provides all development services to Holdings under a cost-plus contract — Studio builds, Holdings owns.

Post-money valuation: $29,350,000 at seed. 0% corporate tax (Cayman sovereign exemption, unconditional, 20-year certificate). Zero substance requirements. VC-standard governance.

## 2. Why Cayman (Not Other Jurisdictions)

| Jurisdiction | Tax Rate | Substance Required? | VC Familiarity | FATF/EU Standing | Conditional? | Annual Cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cayman Islands** | **0%** | **No** — Exempted Companies exempt from Economic Substance Act for IP/revenue holding | **Industry standard** — majority of VC-backed holding cos | Clean — FATF compliant, not on EU blacklist | **No** — unconditional 0%, 20-year exemption certificate | ~$8-14K formation, ~$16-27K/yr | **Selected** |
| BVI | 0% | Increasing (Economic Substance Act) | Common but second-tier | EU blacklist risk (removed 2023, watchlist) | No | ~$5-10K/yr | EU risk, less VC-standard |
| Singapore | 0-17% (Pioneer) | Yes — real office, employees | Familiar (Asia VC) | Excellent | **Yes** — Pioneer Certificate must be applied for and maintained | ~$20-40K/yr | Higher cost, conditional rate, substance burden |
| Delaware LLC/C-Corp | 0% state / 21% federal | Yes | Most familiar (US VC) | N/A | **Yes** — 21% federal CIT applies | ~$5-10K/yr | **21% federal tax on all TE revenue** — disqualifying |
| Second Dubai FZ-LLC | 0% (QFZP) | Yes — employees, office, QFZP qualifying activity | Moderate | Clean | **Yes** — must qualify under QFZP rules, natural persons exclusion risk | ~$50-80K/yr (office + substance) | Concentrates QFZP risk on $35M revenue; substance cost |

**Cayman wins decisively:**

1. **VC-standard** — the majority of institutional VC funds, from Sequoia to a16z, use Cayman holding companies. Investors will not ask "why Cayman?" — they will ask "why NOT Cayman?" if you use anything else.

2. **Unconditional 0%** — no qualifying activity test, no revenue threshold, no QFZP equivalent. The 0% rate is sovereign law, not a qualifying incentive. Cayman has never had corporate tax and has a 20-year exemption certificate mechanism guaranteeing this.

3. **Zero substance requirements** — Exempted Companies holding IP and collecting revenue are explicitly exempt from the Cayman Economic Substance Act (International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act 2018). No office, no employees, no local directors required.

4. **Clean FATF/EU standing** — Cayman is FATF-compliant, not on any EU blacklist, participates in CRS/AEOI, and has a robust anti-money laundering framework. This matters for banking and investor due diligence.

5. **Isolates QFZP risk** — Studio's QFZP eligibility only needs to cover B2B service fees ($1-5M), not the full $10-35M TE revenue stream. If QFZP fails for Studio, the impact is 9% on service fees — not 9% on all revenue.

## 3. Formation and Governance

### Exempted Company Under the Companies Act

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Governing law** | Cayman Islands Companies Act (2023 Revision) |
| **Entity type** | Exempted Company Limited by Shares |
| **Registered office** | Required — at a licensed registered office provider in Cayman |
| **Directors** | Minimum 1. No Cayman residency requirement. No nationality requirement. |
| **Shareholders** | Panamanian Holdings S.A. (~70%) + Investor (~30%). Option pool: 10-15% reserved. |
| **Secretary** | Optional but recommended for governance |
| **Share capital** | Authorized: USD $50,000 (standard). Issued per SHA terms. |
| **Public registry** | Company name and registered office only. Directors, shareholders, and beneficial owners are NOT public. |
| **Formation time** | 1-3 business days (express), 5-7 standard |
| **Formation cost** | ~$5,000-8,000 (government fee + registered office setup + legal) |

### Board Composition

| Director | Role | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Canadian founder | Managing Director / CEO | Operational control, PIF Protector alignment |
| Independent director | Governance, audit committee | Investor requirement, adds legitimacy |
| Investor observer | Board observer seat (non-voting) or full director | Standard seed-round term |

### Share Structure

| Class | Holder | Percentage | Rights |
|---|---|---|---|
| Common (Founder) | Panamanian Holdings S.A. | ~70% | Full voting, dividends, liquidation |
| Series Seed Preferred | Investor | ~30% | Liquidation preference (1x non-participating), anti-dilution (broad-based weighted average), pro-rata rights, information rights |
| Option pool | Reserved | 10-15% | ESOP for key hires (vesting schedule per SHA) |

---

## 4. Tax Treatment

### Corporate Tax

| Income Type | Tax Rate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| TE healing center revenue (global) | **0%** | Cayman has no corporate income tax |
| IP licensing income | **0%** | Cayman has no corporate income tax |
| Intercompany service fee income | **0%** | Cayman has no corporate income tax |
| Capital gains | **0%** | Cayman has no capital gains tax |
| Dividends received | **0%** | Cayman has no withholding or receipt tax |

### Tax Exemption Certificate

Exempted Companies may obtain a **Tax Undertaking Certificate** from the Cayman government guaranteeing:

- No corporate income tax, capital gains tax, withholding tax, or any other tax will be imposed for a period of **20 years** from the date of the certificate
- This survives any future change in Cayman tax law
- Renewable upon expiry

### Withholding Tax

| Payment | WHT |
|---|---|
| Dividends paid by Holdings to S.A. | **0%** |
| Dividends paid by Holdings to Investor | **0%** |
| Service fees paid by Holdings to Studio | **0%** |
| Service fees paid by Holdings to Mexico OpCo | **0%** |
| License fees paid by Holdings to Church | **0%** |

**Cayman imposes zero withholding tax on any outbound payment.** There is no tax treaty network because there is no tax to treaty against.

## 5. Investor Suitability

### Why VCs Prefer Cayman

1. **Familiarity** — VCs have invested in thousands of Cayman holding companies. Legal docs, governance, and exit mechanics are well-understood.
2. **No tax on returns** — 0% on dividends and capital gains means investor returns are not eroded at the entity level.
3. **Clean cap table** — investor buys equity in one entity (Holdings) with clean TE-only economics. No exposure to Studio, LB Consulting, Church, or founder personal entities.
4. **Standard SHA provisions** — Cayman law supports all standard shareholder agreement terms (liquidation preferences, anti-dilution, drag-along/tag-along, board composition, information rights, preemptive rights).
5. **Exit-friendly** — share sale, merger, or asset sale all straightforward under Cayman law. No tax on exit proceeds at entity level.

### S.A. as Majority Shareholder

Panamanian Holdings S.A. (a Panama corporation 100% owned by the PIF) holding ~70% of TE Holdings may prompt investor questions. Key responses:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| "Who controls the S.A. and PIF?" | The S.A. has a board of 3+ directors (Canadian founder + independents). The PIF's Foundation Council (3 members, at least 1 independent) oversees the S.A. The Canadian founder is PIF Protector. |
| "Can the S.A./PIF dump shares?" | SHA includes lock-up, drag-along/tag-along, and transfer restrictions. S.A. is bound by SHA like any shareholder. |
| "Why not founders directly?" | S.A. + PIF provides double-layer asset protection, tax efficiency (0% on distributions to UAE-resident founder), and separation of personal from corporate liability. Standard for international founders. |
| "Does the US founder have hidden control?" | US founder is NOT a PIF beneficiary, NOT a Foundation Council member, NOT an S.A. director, has NO signatory authority over S.A. or PIF accounts. This is documented and legally binding. |

## 6. IP Ownership and Revenue Model

### IP Creation Flow

```
Studio (Dubai) creates TE IP under contract
    → Development Services Agreement with Holdings
    → IP assigned to Holdings upon delivery (work-for-hire)
    → Holdings owns all TE IP from inception

Holdings owns:
    - TE healing center platform (app, AI agents, algorithms)
    - TE spiritual content (courses, protocols, books)
    - TE brand and trademarks
    - All future TE product IP
```

### Revenue Model

| Revenue Stream | Y1 | Y5 | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Program revenue | $10,300,000 | $33,180,000 | Guest payments via Stripe |
| Bio-optimization premium | $309,000 | $995,000 | ~30% upsell on program fee |
| Post-care subscriptions | $139,000 | $1,286,000 | ~36% uptake, recurring |
| **Total TE Revenue** | **$10,748,000** | **$35,461,000** | |
| 5-Year Cumulative Revenue | | | **$125,880,000** |

All revenue flows to Holdings at 0% corporate tax. Holdings then pays:
- Development services fee to Studio (cost + 8-12%)
- Service delivery fee to Mexico OpCo (cost + 8-12%)
- Content license fee to Church (arm's length royalty)

### EBITDA Retention

| Year | Revenue | EBITDA Margin | EBITDA | Entity Tax | Net Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $10,748,000 | 43% | $4,672,000 | $0 | $4,672,000 |
| 2 | $18,152,000 | 57% | $10,347,000 | $0 | $10,347,000 |
| 3 | $25,904,000 | 60% | $15,542,000 | $0 | $15,542,000 |
| 4 | $31,715,000 | 60% | $19,029,000 | $0 | $19,029,000 |
| 5 | $35,461,000 | 61% | $21,512,217 | $0 | $21,512,217 |

*Mexico OpCo pays ~30% on its 8-12% service margin locally. All other profit retained in Holdings at 0%.*

## 8. Banking and Payment Processing

### Banking Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Cayman bank** | Local to entity, standard for Exempted Companies | Limited digital banking, some require high minimums |
| **Singapore bank (recommended)** | Excellent digital banking, multi-currency, Stripe integration, familiar with Cayman entities | May require in-person opening |
| **UK bank** | Strong for USD/GBP, Cayman entities well-understood | Compliance-heavy, slower onboarding |

### Payment Processing

| Method | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Stripe** | Guest payments (program fees, subscriptions). Stripe entity in Cayman or Singapore. |
| **Bank wire** | Intercompany payments (Holdings→Studio, Holdings→Mexico) |
| **Wise Business** | Multi-currency management, smaller transfers |

### KYC Documentation

Banks will require:
- Certificate of Incorporation (Cayman)
- Certificate of Good Standing
- Memorandum and Articles of Association
- Register of Directors and Members (certified)
- UBO declaration (S.A. → PIF → founders chain + investor)
- S.A. documentation (Certificate of Incorporation, board resolution, Articles)
- PIF documentation (Panama)
- Investor KYC (fund documentation)
- Business plan / financial projections
- Source of funds documentation

## 9. Substance Requirements

**TE Wellness Holdings has ZERO substance requirements in Cayman.**

The Cayman Islands International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act 2018 requires "relevant entities" conducting "relevant activities" to maintain economic substance in Cayman. However:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Is Holdings a "relevant entity"? | Yes — it is a Cayman Exempted Company |
| Does Holdings conduct "relevant activities"? | It holds IP and collects revenue. IP holding is a relevant activity. |
| Does the IP holding exemption apply? | **Yes** — Holdings holds IP created by a related party (Studio) under contract. The substance requirements for "intellectual property business" apply only to entities that are "high risk IP entities" — those that acquired IP from a related party and license it to a related party. Holdings licenses to Church (unrelated) and Mexico OpCo (subsidiary). Standard IP holding companies that collect revenue from third parties (guests) are not high-risk. |
| What must Holdings file? | Annual Economic Substance Notification confirming its relevant activities. |
| What is the practical requirement? | Board meetings (can be held anywhere), maintain books and records, file annual notification. No Cayman office, employees, or local directors required. |

**Additionally:** The 20-year Tax Undertaking Certificate provides a separate sovereign guarantee of 0% tax regardless of substance analysis.

## 12. Advantages for All Parties

### For Investors

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **VC-standard vehicle** | Cayman Exempted Company — the same structure used by the majority of institutional VC investments globally |
| **Clean TE economics** | Investor buys into TE revenue and IP only. No exposure to Studio overhead, LB Consulting, Church, or founder personal entities. |
| **0% tax efficiency** | All TE revenue retained at 0%. No entity-level tax erosion of returns. |
| **Risk isolation** | Holdings is structurally separated from Studio (service company), LB Consulting (separate business), and Church (nonprofit). Liability in one entity does not reach Holdings. |
| **Easy Series A** | Standard Cayman SHA. Next-round investors will require no restructuring. |
| **Familiar governance** | Board, SHA, information rights, liquidation preferences — all standard Cayman mechanics. |

### For Founders

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dilution isolated to TE only** | Investor gets ~30% of Holdings. Founders retain 100% of Studio and 100% of LB Consulting via S.A. and PIF. |
| **Studio stays 100% theirs** | Studio is a pure service company earning cost-plus fees. No investor claim on Studio revenue, IP, or profits. |
| **LB Consulting stays 100% theirs** | All Light Brands revenue, IP, and client relationships remain in CI IBC — fully PIF-owned, zero investor involvement. |
| **Flexible exits** | Can sell Holdings (investor + PIF exit together), sell Studio separately, sell LB separately, or hold any combination. |
| **PIF distributions from three sources** | TE Holdings profits + Studio service margins + LB Consulting profits all flow to PIF → founders at 0% (Canadian/UAE) or 5-7.65% (Cyprus). |

### For Tax Defense

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **QFZP risk isolated** | Studio's QFZP only needs to cover B2B service fees ($1-5M), not $35M in TE revenue. If QFZP fails → 9% on service fees, not 9% on all revenue. |
| **Cayman globally accepted** | No tax authority treats Cayman holding companies as inherently suspect. Cayman is the jurisdiction of choice for Apple, Google, and thousands of multinationals. |
| **Investor as independent validator** | A sophisticated, arms-length investor choosing to invest in Holdings validates the entity's business purpose. This defeats any "sham entity" argument. |
| **Genuine operating entity** | Holdings collects $10-35M in revenue, holds IP worth millions, controls an operating subsidiary, and has an independent board. This is not a shell. |
| **Arm's length pricing** | Holdings↔Studio and Holdings↔Mexico agreements are standard intercompany service arrangements, benchmarked annually. |

### For the Church

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Greater independence** | Content license comes from TE Holdings (investor-backed entity with independent board), not from 100% founder-controlled Studio. This strengthens the church's independence defense. |
| **Dual royalty sources** | Church receives content license from Holdings + spiritual tech license from CI IBC. Two independent, arm's length royalty streams. |
| **No governance overlap** | Holdings has its own board (founder + independent + investor observer). Church has its own Spiritual Council. Zero overlap. |

### For Operations

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Single dev budget** | Studio carries all developer costs, office, and substance. TE Holdings and LB Consulting both contract with Studio. One team, two clients. |
| **Shared service center** | Studio operates as a shared service center — builds for Holdings and for LB Consulting. This strengthens Studio's QFZP position (pure B2B service company) and its DEMPE substance. |
| **Future products = new entities** | The architecture supports adding new product entities (each contracted with Studio) without restructuring. |
| **Clean expansion** | New healing center locations → new OpCos under Holdings. Each location's OpCo contracts with Holdings for IP and services. |

*This document describes the operating specifications for a Cayman Islands Exempted Company within the TE Wellness / Light Brands unified structure. The Cayman tax exemption is an explicit provision of the Cayman Islands Companies Act and Tax Concessions Act, with a 20-year Tax Undertaking Certificate mechanism. All tax treatments described are based on current Cayman law. Implementation requires validation by qualified Cayman corporate counsel, UAE tax counsel, and investor legal counsel.*
