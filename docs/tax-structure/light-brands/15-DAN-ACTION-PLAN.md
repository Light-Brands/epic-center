## How to Use This Document

This is a sequential action plan. Each phase depends on the previous phase. Within each phase, items marked **PARALLEL** can run simultaneously. Items marked **SEQUENTIAL** must complete before the next step.

**The critical path:** Grenada CBI takes 4-6 months. Entity formation takes 4-8 weeks. Renunciation takes 2-6 months after second citizenship. **Total: 10-18 months from today to full operation as a non-US citizen.**

The window to avoid covered expatriate status is shrinking. Every new deal that adds business value pushes closer to the $2M threshold. Act now.

---

## Phase 0: This Week — Confirm the Window Is Open

**Timeline: Days 1-7**
**Purpose: Verify Dan qualifies for non-covered expatriate status**

- [ ] **0.1 — Calculate net worth (comprehensive)**

  Include ALL worldwide assets:
  - Bank accounts (all currencies, all countries)
  - Investment accounts (brokerage, crypto, retirement)
  - Real estate (fair market value minus mortgage)
  - Vehicles and tangible property
  - Business interests — this is the critical one: what is the fair market value of any existing business interests, signed contracts, or letters of intent?
  - Life insurance cash value
  - Retirement accounts (IRA, 401k)
  - Outstanding loans owed TO you
  - Minus: liabilities (mortgages, student loans, credit cards, debts)

  **Target: Total must be under $2,000,000**

  **If uncertain about business valuation:** A pre-revenue or early-revenue company with no signed contracts has a FMV near $0. If deals are "coming together" but nothing is signed, the FMV is arguably minimal. **Confirm this with expat tax attorney.**

- [ ] **0.2 — Calculate average annual tax liability (5 years)**

  Add up total US income tax paid for 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025, divide by 5.

  **Target: Average must be under ~$190,000 (2026 inflation-adjusted threshold)**

- [ ] **0.3 — Verify 5-year tax compliance**

  Confirm all US federal tax returns are filed for 2021-2025. No late penalties. No unfiled returns. No ongoing IRS disputes.

  **If any returns are missing:** File them immediately. You cannot renounce until you certify 5-year compliance.

- [ ] **0.4 — Defer business value (if needed)**

  If deals are close to signing that could push net worth over $2M:
  - **Do NOT sign equity agreements yet** — keep business interests at zero FMV
  - **Defer equity issuance** to other founders — Dan's shares can be issued after renunciation
  - **Structure deals through the CI IBC** (once formed) — so the value accrues to the corporate entity, not Dan personally

  **Key principle:** At the date of renunciation, Dan should personally own as little as possible. Business value should sit in entities (CI IBC), not in Dan's hands.

---

## Phase 1: Engage Counsel — Weeks 1-2

**Timeline: Weeks 1-2 (start immediately)**
**Purpose: Get professional validation before spending money on formation**

  Scope:
  - Form Fundación Light Brands (PIF)
  - Form Light Brands Holdings S.A.
  - Draft Foundation Charter + Private Regulations
  - Appoint Foundation Council (at least 1 Panamanian resident nominee)
  - Confirm PIF → S.A. → CI IBC chain is valid

  **Where to find:** Icaza, González-Ruiz & Alemán; Morgan & Morgan; or Arias, Fábrega & Fábrega (top Panama firms).

  **Budget:** $5,000-10,000 for PIF + S.A. formation combined

- [ ] **1.4 — Engage Grenada CBI agent**

  Scope:
  - Begin Citizenship by Investment application
  - National Transformation Fund route: $235,000 (single applicant) or $270,000 (applicant + spouse)
  - Due diligence fee: $7,500
  - Application/processing fees: ~$5,000-8,000
  - Legal/agent fees: ~$5,000-10,000

  **Total Grenada CBI cost:** ~$252,000-295,000 (single) or ~$287,000-330,000 (with wife)

  **Where to find:** Authorized Grenada CBI agents — CS Global Partners, Harvey Law Group, Astons.

  **Timeline:** 4-6 months from application to passport in hand.

- [ ] **1.5 — (Optional) Begin Paraguay residency**

  Backup second residency/citizenship path:
  - Temporary residency: ~$5,000-8,000
  - Permanent residency: after 3 years
  - Citizenship: after 3 years of permanent residency (or by naturalization)
  - Total cost: ~$8,000-12,000

  **Why:** Backup passport + South American residence option. Low cost. Runs in parallel with Grenada.

---

## Phase 2: Entity Formation — Months 1-3

**Timeline: Weeks 2-12 (overlaps with Phase 1)**
**Purpose: Build the corporate structure**
**Dependency: Counsel from Phase 1 must validate the plan before spending formation money**

### SEQUENTIAL — Form in This Order

- [ ] **2.1 — Form Panama PIF: Fundación Light Brands**

  Timeline: 2-4 weeks from counsel engagement

  Deliverables:
  - Foundation Charter (public, filed with Panama Registry)
  - Private Regulations (private, names beneficiaries)
  - Foundation Council appointed (3+ members)
  - Protector appointed (optional, recommended)
  - Initial endowment ($10,000)
  - Certificate of Registration

  **Beneficiaries named in Private Regulations:** Dan, Nicholas, Andreas. NOT wife. NOT Jason.

- [ ] **2.2 — Form Panama S.A.: Light Brands Holdings S.A.**

  Timeline: 1-2 weeks after PIF (can be simultaneous with same counsel)

  Deliverables:
  - Articles of Incorporation
  - Board of Directors appointed (3 minimum)
  - Officers appointed (President, Secretary, Treasurer)
  - Shares issued — 100% to Fundación Light Brands (PIF)
  - Certificate of Incorporation
  - Tax ID (RUC) obtained

  **Dependency:** PIF must exist to be the sole shareholder of the S.A.

- [ ] **2.3 — Form Cook Islands IBC: Light Brands AI Ltd**

  Timeline: 2-5 weeks from engagement of CI registered agent

  Deliverables:
  - Memorandum of Association
  - Articles of Association (include shareholder restrictions, transfer rules, dividend policy)
  - Certificate of Incorporation
  - Register of Directors (Dan + nominee)
  - Register of Shareholders (4 shareholders per cap table)
  - Share certificates issued:
    - 300 shares → Light Brands Holdings S.A. (Dan's vehicle)
    - 300 shares → Nicholas Courschesne
    - 300 shares → Andreas Demou
    - 100 shares → Jason Sparks

  **Dependency:** S.A. must exist to be a shareholder. Nicholas, Andreas, Jason can hold shares directly.

  **Important timing note:** If Dan has not yet renounced US citizenship at the time of CI IBC formation, his equity should be issued to the S.A. (owned by PIF), NOT to Dan personally. This keeps the business value in the PIF structure, not in Dan's personal net worth for covered expatriate calculation.

- [ ] **2.4 — Open Singapore bank account for CI IBC**

  Timeline: 2-4 weeks after CI IBC incorporation

  Actions:
  - Apply to DBS, OCBC, or Statrys (CI registered agent may have banking introductions)
  - Prepare KYC documentation (see doc 14, Section 12)
  - Schedule Singapore trip for in-person account opening (budget $1,500-2,500 for travel)
  - Set up online banking, multi-currency capabilities

  **Dependency:** CI IBC must be incorporated. KYC docs from all entities (PIF, S.A., IBC) required.

- [ ] **2.5 — Open Panama bank account for S.A.**

  Timeline: 2-4 weeks (can be parallel with Singapore)

  Actions:
  - Apply at Banco General or Banistmo
  - Standard Panama corporate account opening
  - This account receives dividends from CI IBC and distributes to PIF

- [ ] **2.6 — Set up payment infrastructure**

  Timeline: 1-2 weeks after bank accounts open

  Actions:
  - [ ] Stripe account (connected to Singapore bank) — for SaaS/product billing
  - [ ] Wise Business account — for international contractor payments
  - [ ] Deel account — for EOR and contractor management (if needed immediately)

---

## Phase 3: Agreements & Operations — Months 2-4

**Timeline: Weeks 8-16**
**Purpose: Legal agreements that make the business operational**

### PARALLEL — All Can Be Drafted Simultaneously

- [ ] **3.1 — Shareholders' Agreement**

  Between: Light Brands Holdings S.A. (Dan), Nicholas, Andreas, Jason

  Key terms:
  - Equity split: 30/30/30/10
  - Vesting: 4 years, 1-year cliff
  - Right of first refusal on share transfers
  - Tag-along / drag-along rights
  - Dividend policy (minimum quarterly distribution of X% of net profit)
  - Reserved matters (requiring supermajority: new share issuance, sale of company, change of Articles)
  - Deadlock resolution mechanism
  - Non-compete and non-solicit
  - Departure terms (good leaver / bad leaver)
  - Governing law: Cook Islands or English law (counsel advises)

  **Who drafts:** CI registered agent's legal team or independent commercial lawyer (Singapore or UK firm).

  **Budget:** $3,000-8,000

- [ ] **3.2 — Dan's contractor/director agreement**

  Between: Dan Lawless and Light Brands AI Ltd

  Key terms:
  - Role: Managing Director + Lead Consultant
  - Monthly fee: $10,000-20,000/month (adjust to need)
  - IP assignment: all work product belongs to CI IBC
  - Term: rolling annual
  - Termination: mutual 30-day notice

- [ ] **3.3 — Wife's contractor agreement**

  - Role: Operations / Admin / Marketing (must be real services)
  - Annual fee: $130,000 (= FEIE threshold for $0 US tax)
  - IP assignment: all work product belongs to CI IBC
  - Payment: monthly ($10,833/month)
  - Term: rolling annual
  - **She is NOT a shareholder, director, or PIF beneficiary**

  **Critical:** The services must be genuine. The IRS can challenge FEIE if the "contractor" arrangement is a sham. She should have real responsibilities, produce real work product, and maintain time records.

- [ ] **3.4 — Developer contractor agreement (template)**

  Standard template for all dev contractors:
  - Scope of work (per project or ongoing)
  - IP assignment clause (all IP → CI IBC)
  - Payment terms (monthly invoice, 14-day payment)
  - Confidentiality and NDA
  - Independent contractor classification (not employee)
  - Termination: mutual 14-30 day notice
  - Pre-existing IP exclusion

  **Budget for legal drafting:** $1,000-3,000 for template

- [ ] **3.5 — Begin client contracting**

  Light Brands AI Ltd signs its first client contracts. Revenue flows to the Singapore bank account.

  - Consulting agreements → CI IBC is the contracting party

  - All invoices issued by Light Brands AI Ltd

---

## Phase 4: Renunciation — Months 6-9

**Timeline: Months 6-9 (after Grenada passport received)**
**Purpose: Dan becomes a non-US citizen**
**Dependency: Grenada passport MUST be in hand before scheduling renunciation**

### SEQUENTIAL — Strict Order

- [ ] **4.1 — Receive Grenada citizenship and passport**

  Expected: Month 6-7 from application

  Verify:
  - Grenada passport received
  - Citizenship certificate received
  - Passport is valid and biometric
  - You are now a dual citizen (US + Grenada)

- [ ] **4.2 — Final pre-renunciation checklist**

  Before scheduling the renunciation appointment, confirm ALL of the following:

  | Item | Status |
  |------|--------|
  | Grenada passport in hand | [ ] |
  | Net worth confirmed under $2M (re-check — value may have changed since Phase 0) | [ ] |
  | Average annual tax under $190K | [ ] |
  | 5-year tax compliance confirmed | [ ] |
  | Expat tax attorney has signed off | [ ] |
  | Wife understands and agrees | [ ] |
  | All entity formation complete (PIF, S.A., CI IBC) | [ ] |
  | Singapore bank account open and operational | [ ] |
  | Revenue flowing through CI IBC (not through Dan personally) | [ ] |
  | Dan's equity is held by S.A./PIF (not personally) | [ ] |

  **If net worth has crossed $2M since Phase 0:** STOP. Consult expat tax attorney immediately. Options may include: transferring assets to PIF before renunciation (must be done carefully to avoid fraudulent transfer claims), timing the renunciation to a point where business valuation is lower, or accepting covered expatriate status and modeling the consequences.

- [ ] **4.3 — Schedule renunciation appointment**

  Contact nearest US embassy or consulate. Commonly used locations for expats:
  - San Jose, Costa Rica
  - Panama City, Panama
  - Bridgetown, Barbados
  - London, UK

  **Wait time:** 1-4 months for appointment (varies by location).

  **Fee:** $2,350 (US State Department renunciation fee)

- [ ] **4.4 — Attend renunciation appointment**

  At the appointment:
  - Complete forms: DS-4079, DS-4080, DS-4081, DS-4083
  - Take the Oath of Renunciation (witnessed by consular officer)
  - Surrender US passport
  - Pay $2,350 fee

  **You are now a former US citizen.** The consulate forwards paperwork to Washington.

- [ ] **4.5 — File final US tax return**

  Timeline: Due by June 15 of the following year (automatic extension for overseas filers) or April 15 if you elect.

  File:
  - **Form 1040** — final return, covering January 1 through date of renunciation (partial year)
  - **Form 8854** — Initial and Annual Expatriation Statement. This is where you certify:
    - Net worth was under $2M
    - Average annual tax was under $190K
    - You are in compliance for the past 5 years
  - **FBAR** — final filing for any foreign accounts
  - **Form 8938** — final filing for foreign financial assets

  **Budget for final return preparation:** $2,000-5,000 (specialized expat tax preparer)

- [ ] **4.6 — Receive Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN)**

  Timeline: 3-12 months after the appointment (State Department processing)

  The CLN is your proof of renunciation. Keep original and certified copies. You will need this for:
  - Foreign banks (proving you are no longer a US person for FATCA purposes)
  - Tax authorities in new residence country
  - Immigration (proving your Grenada citizenship is your primary nationality)

---

## Phase 5: Post-Renunciation Setup — Months 9-12

**Timeline: After renunciation is complete**
**Purpose: Optimize the structure now that US tax code no longer applies to Dan**

- [ ] **5.1 — Dan becomes PIF beneficiary (if not already)**

  If Dan was not named as a PIF beneficiary during formation (to avoid US trust reporting), update the Private Regulations now.

  Dan is no longer a US person. Being a PIF beneficiary creates zero US tax exposure.

- [ ] **5.2 — Establish tax residence**

  Dan should establish formal tax residence in a territorial-tax country:

  | Country | Tax on Foreign Income | Residency Cost | Benefits |
  |---------|----------------------|----------------|----------|
  | **Costa Rica** | 0% (territorial) | Rentista visa: ~$2,500/yr income proof | Lifestyle, proximity to US, wife can visit |
  | **Panama** | 0% (territorial) | Friendly Nations visa: ~$5,000 | Banking hub, PIF counsel nearby, no personal income tax on foreign |
  | **Paraguay** | 0% on foreign income (if non-domiciled) | ~$8,000 initial | Cheapest path to second passport (3 years) |

  **Recommended:** Panama (closest to PIF counsel, banking infrastructure, 0% on all foreign income, straightforward residency).

- [ ] **5.3 — Apply for E-2 treaty investor visa (via Grenada)**

  Grenada has an E-2 treaty with the US. This means Dan can get an E-2 visa to enter and work in the US:

  | Element | Detail |
  |---------|--------|
  | Treaty | US-Grenada E-2 Treaty |
  | Requirement | "Substantial investment" in a US enterprise |
  | Typical investment | $100,000-200,000 (no statutory minimum) |
  | Duration | 5 years, renewable indefinitely |
  | Work authorization | Yes — in the treaty enterprise |
  | Path to green card | No (E-2 is non-immigrant). But wife can petition via I-130 anytime. |

  **Only needed if Dan wants regular US access beyond tourist visa (90-day ESTA/B-1/B-2).**

- [ ] **5.4 — Update all banking and financial accounts**

  Notify all banks and financial institutions that Dan is no longer a US person:
  - Update W-8BEN (replacing W-9)
  - Remove FATCA reporting obligations
  - Update tax residency information
  - Provide CLN as proof

- [ ] **5.5 — Wife's ongoing compliance setup**

  Ensure wife has the following on autopilot:
  - US expat tax preparer (annual engagement for 1040 + 2555 + FBAR + 8938)
  - Calendar reminders for filing deadlines
  - 330-day tracker (she cannot spend more than 35 days in the US per 12-month period for FEIE 330-day test)
  - Form 3520 filing if Dan gifts her > $100K/yr

---

## Budget Summary — What This All Costs

### One-Time Formation Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Grenada CBI (single applicant) | $252,000-295,000 |
| Paraguay residency (optional, parallel) | $8,000-12,000 |
| Panama PIF formation | $3,000-5,000 |
| Panama S.A. formation | $2,000-3,500 |
| Cook Islands IBC formation | $3,000-5,000 |
| Singapore bank opening (incl. travel) | $1,500-2,500 |
| Legal counsel (US expat, Panama, CI) | $10,000-20,000 |
| Shareholders' agreement | $3,000-8,000 |
| Contractor agreement templates | $1,000-3,000 |
| US renunciation fee | $2,350 |
| Final US tax return preparation | $2,000-5,000 |
| **Total one-time (with Grenada)** | **~$288,000-359,000** |
| **Total one-time (without Grenada — if other citizenship available)** | **~$28,000-52,000** |

### Annual Ongoing Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| CI IBC maintenance | $2,500-4,500 |
| Panama S.A. maintenance | $1,600-3,000 |
| Panama PIF maintenance | $2,000-3,500 |
| Singapore bank | $200-500 |
| Wife's US tax prep | $1,500-3,000 |
| Jason's US tax prep (his expense) | $1,500-3,000 |
| **Total annual** | **~$9,300-17,500** |

### The ROI

| Scenario | Annual LB AI Revenue | Tax Under Current US Structure | Tax Under This Plan | Annual Savings |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-|
| Year 1 | $500,000 | ~$60-80K (Dan's US tax + entity overhead) | ~$13K (entity overhead only) | **~$47-67K** |
| Year 3 | $1,500,000 | ~$150-250K | ~$13K | **~$137-237K** |
| Year 5 | $3,000,000+ | ~$300-500K+ | ~$13K | **~$287-487K+** |

The Grenada CBI cost ($252-295K) pays for itself within 2-4 years at modest revenue levels.

## Emergency Scenarios

### "What if my net worth crosses $2M before I can renounce?"

Options:
1. **Accelerate renunciation** — some embassies have shorter wait times. Consider Bridgetown, Barbados or smaller Caribbean posts.
2. **Transfer assets to PIF before renunciation** — must be done carefully. If IRS views it as tax-motivated, it could be challenged. Expat tax attorney must advise.
3. **Accept covered expatriate status** — model the consequences. The ~40% gift tax to US persons is harsh, but if your wife earns $130K independently and you rarely gift her large amounts, the practical impact may be manageable.
4. **Defer equity issuance** — if CI IBC shares haven't been issued to the S.A. yet, the business value doesn't appear on Dan's personal balance sheet. The PIF/S.A. exist as empty shells with minimal value.

### "What if Grenada CBI takes longer than 6 months?"

- Paraguay doesn't work as a renunciation backup (citizenship takes 3+ years)
- Consider Dominica CBI as faster alternative ($100K, 2-3 months faster in some cases)
- Do NOT renounce without a second citizenship — you'll be stateless, which creates severe travel and banking complications

### "What if Singapore banks won't open an account for the CI IBC?"

Alternative banking:
- Hong Kong (Statrys, HSBC) — accepts CI IBCs
- Mauritius — more flexible KYC for offshore structures
- EMI (Electronic Money Institution) — Mercury, Relay (may accept CI IBCs with PIF ownership)
- Panama (through the S.A.) — as a fallback primary account

### "What if wife needs to spend more than 35 days in the US?"

She fails the 330-day test for FEIE. Options:
- **Bona fide residence test** — if she has genuine foreign residence (lease, local bank account, community ties), she may qualify under this test instead. It's a facts-and-circumstances determination — less clean than the 330-day test.
- **Increase salary above $130K** and pay the tax on the overage. At $175K, she pays ~$5,600 in federal tax. Not ideal, but manageable.
- **Limit US visits to 35 days** — this is the simplest solution. Short visits for family, holidays, etc.

*This is an actionable execution plan for forming Light Brands AI as a Cook Islands IBC with Panama PIF asset protection, and for Daniel Lawless to renounce US citizenship while avoiding covered expatriate status. Timelines are estimates based on standard processing times for Grenada CBI, Panama entity formation, Cook Islands IBC incorporation, and US renunciation procedures as of February 2026. Actual timelines may vary. All actions should be validated by qualified professionals: US expat tax attorney, Cook Islands registered agent, Panama PIF counsel, and Grenada CBI authorized agent. This is not legal or tax advice.*
