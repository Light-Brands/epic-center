## How to Use This Document

This is a sequential action plan. Each phase depends on the previous phase. Within each phase, items marked **PARALLEL** can run simultaneously. Items marked **SEQUENTIAL** must complete before the next step.

**The critical path:** Grenada CBI takes 4-6 months. Entity formation (including Cyprus Studio) takes 6-12 weeks. Renunciation takes 2-6 months after second citizenship. **Total: 10-18 months from today to full operation as a non-US citizen.**

The window to avoid covered expatriate status is shrinking. Every new deal that adds business value pushes closer to the $2M threshold. Act now.

---

## Phase 0: This Week — Confirm the Window Is Open

**Timeline: Days 1-7**
**Purpose: Verify Dan qualifies for non-covered expatriate status**

- [ ] **0.1 — Calculate net worth (comprehensive)**

  Include ALL worldwide assets:
  - Bank accounts (all currencies, all countries)
  - Investment accounts (brokerage, crypto, retirement)
  - Real estate (fair market value minus mortgage)
  - Vehicles and tangible property
  - Business interests — this is the critical one: what is the fair market value of any existing business interests, signed contracts, or letters of intent?
  - Life insurance cash value
  - Retirement accounts (IRA, 401k)
  - Outstanding loans owed TO you
  - Minus: liabilities (mortgages, student loans, credit cards, debts)

  **Target: Total must be under $2,000,000**

  **If uncertain about business valuation:** A pre-revenue or early-revenue company with no signed contracts has a FMV near $0. If deals are "coming together" but nothing is signed, the FMV is arguably minimal. **Confirm this with expat tax attorney.**

- [ ] **0.2 — Calculate average annual tax liability (5 years)**

  Add up total US income tax paid for 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025, divide by 5.

  **Target: Average must be under ~$190,000 (2026 inflation-adjusted threshold)**

- [ ] **0.3 — Verify 5-year tax compliance**

  Confirm all US federal tax returns are filed for 2021-2025. No late penalties. No unfiled returns. No ongoing IRS disputes.

  **If any returns are missing:** File them immediately. You cannot renounce until you certify 5-year compliance.

- [ ] **0.4 — Defer business value (if needed)**

  If deals are close to signing that could push net worth over $2M:
  - **Do NOT sign equity agreements yet** — keep business interests at zero FMV
  - **Defer equity issuance** — Dan's S.A. shares (via PIF) can be issued after renunciation
  - **Structure deals through the CI IBC** (once formed) — so the value accrues to the corporate structure (S.A. → LBC/LBS), not Dan personally

  **Key principle:** At the date of renunciation, Dan should personally own as little as possible. Business value should sit in the corporate structure (PIF → S.A. → subsidiaries), not in Dan's hands.

---

## Phase 2: Entity Formation — Months 1-3

**Timeline: Weeks 2-12 (overlaps with Phase 1)**
**Purpose: Build the corporate structure**
**Dependency: Counsel from Phase 1 must validate the plan before spending formation money**

### SEQUENTIAL — Form in This Order

  Deliverables:
  - Articles of Incorporation
  - Board of Directors appointed (3 minimum)

  - Shares issued to all four founders:
    - 30% → Dan's PIF (Fundación Light Brands)

    - 30% → Andreas Demou (direct, Cyprus citizen)
    - 10% → Jason Sparks (direct, US citizen)
  - Certificate of Incorporation

  **Dependency:** S.A. must exist to be the sole shareholder.

  **Important timing note:** Because the CI IBC is 100% owned by the S.A. (not by Dan personally), the business value sits in the corporate structure — not in Dan's personal net worth for covered expatriate calculation. All founder equity is at the S.A. level.

  - [ ] **Smart Contract** — Deploy distribution contract on Base/Ethereum for quarterly founder distributions (30/30/30/10 split). Audit contract before mainnet deployment.

- [ ] **3.1 — Shareholders' Agreement (S.A. level)**

  Between: Dan's PIF (30%), Nicholas's PIF (30%), Andreas Demou (30%), Jason Sparks (10%) — as shareholders of Light Brands Holdings S.A.

  Key terms:
  - Equity split: 30/30/30/10 at the S.A. level

- [ ] **3.4 — Developer contractor agreement (template)**

  Standard template for all dev contractors:
  - Scope of work (per project or ongoing)

---

## Phase 4: Renunciation — Months 6-9

**Timeline: Months 6-9 (after Grenada passport received)**
**Purpose: Dan becomes a non-US citizen**
**Dependency: Grenada passport MUST be in hand before scheduling renunciation**

### SEQUENTIAL — Strict Order

- [ ] **4.1 — Receive Grenada citizenship and passport**

  Expected: Month 6-7 from application

  Verify:
  - Grenada passport received
  - Citizenship certificate received
  - Passport is valid and biometric
  - You are now a dual citizen (US + Grenada)

- [ ] **4.2 — Final pre-renunciation checklist**

  Before scheduling the renunciation appointment, confirm ALL of the following:

  | Item | Status |
  |------|--------|
  | Grenada passport in hand | [ ] |
  | Net worth confirmed under $2M (re-check — value may have changed since Phase 0) | [ ] |
  | Average annual tax under $190K | [ ] |
  | 5-year tax compliance confirmed | [ ] |
  | Expat tax attorney has signed off | [ ] |
  | Wife understands and agrees | [ ] |
  | All entity formation complete (PIFs, S.A., CI IBC, Cyprus Studio) | [ ] |
  | Crypto treasury live (Fireblocks + Circle + Stripe USDC) | [ ] |
  | Distribution smart contract deployed and audited | [ ] |
  | Cyprus bank account open and operational (EUR payroll) | [ ] |
  | Revenue flowing through CI IBC (not through Dan personally) | [ ] |
  | Dan's equity is held by PIF → S.A. (not personally) | [ ] |
  | Both LBC and LBS are 100% owned by S.A. | [ ] |

  **If net worth has crossed $2M since Phase 0:** STOP. Consult expat tax attorney immediately. Options may include: transferring assets to PIF before renunciation (must be done carefully to avoid fraudulent transfer claims), timing the renunciation to a point where business valuation is lower, or accepting covered expatriate status and modeling the consequences.

- [ ] **4.3 — Schedule renunciation appointment**

  Contact nearest US embassy or consulate. Commonly used locations for expats:
  - San Jose, Costa Rica
  - Panama City, Panama
  - Bridgetown, Barbados
  - London, UK

  **Wait time:** 1-4 months for appointment (varies by location).

  **Fee:** $2,350 (US State Department renunciation fee)

- [ ] **4.4 — Attend renunciation appointment**

  At the appointment:
  - Complete forms: DS-4079, DS-4080, DS-4081, DS-4083
  - Take the Oath of Renunciation (witnessed by consular officer)
  - Surrender US passport
  - Pay $2,350 fee

  **You are now a former US citizen.** The consulate forwards paperwork to Washington.

- [ ] **4.5 — File final US tax return**

  Timeline: Due by June 15 of the following year (automatic extension for overseas filers) or April 15 if you elect.

  File:
  - **Form 1040** — final return, covering January 1 through date of renunciation (partial year)
  - **Form 8854** — Initial and Annual Expatriation Statement. This is where you certify:
    - Net worth was under $2M
    - Average annual tax was under $190K
    - You are in compliance for the past 5 years
  - **FBAR** — final filing for any foreign accounts
  - **Form 8938** — final filing for foreign financial assets

  **Budget for final return preparation:** $2,000-5,000 (specialized expat tax preparer)

- [ ] **4.6 — Receive Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN)**

  Timeline: 3-12 months after the appointment (State Department processing)

  The CLN is your proof of renunciation. Keep original and certified copies. You will need this for:
  - Foreign banks (proving you are no longer a US person for FATCA purposes)
  - Tax authorities in new residence country
  - Immigration (proving your Grenada citizenship is your primary nationality)

---

## Phase 5: Post-Renunciation Setup — Months 9-12

**Timeline: After renunciation is complete**
**Purpose: Optimize the structure now that US tax code no longer applies to Dan**

- [ ] **5.1 — Dan becomes PIF beneficiary (if not already)**

  If Dan was not named as a PIF beneficiary during formation (to avoid US trust reporting), update the Private Regulations now.

  Dan is no longer a US person. Being a PIF beneficiary creates zero US tax exposure.

- [ ] **5.2 — Establish tax residence**

  Dan should establish formal tax residence in a territorial-tax country:

  | Country | Tax on Foreign Income | Residency Cost | Benefits |
  |---------|----------------------|----------------|----------|
  | **Costa Rica** | 0% (territorial) | Rentista visa: ~$2,500/yr income proof | Lifestyle, proximity to US, wife can visit |
  | **Panama** | 0% (territorial) | Friendly Nations visa: ~$5,000 | Banking hub, PIF counsel nearby, no personal income tax on foreign |
  | **Paraguay** | 0% on foreign income (if non-domiciled) | ~$8,000 initial | Cheapest path to second passport (3 years) |

  **Recommended:** Panama (closest to PIF counsel, banking infrastructure, 0% on all foreign income, straightforward residency).

- [ ] **5.3 — Apply for E-2 treaty investor visa (via Grenada)**

  Grenada has an E-2 treaty with the US. This means Dan can get an E-2 visa to enter and work in the US:

  | Element | Detail |
  |---------|--------|
  | Treaty | US-Grenada E-2 Treaty |
  | Requirement | "Substantial investment" in a US enterprise |
  | Typical investment | $100,000-200,000 (no statutory minimum) |
  | Duration | 5 years, renewable indefinitely |
  | Work authorization | Yes — in the treaty enterprise |
  | Path to green card | No (E-2 is non-immigrant). But wife can petition via I-130 anytime. |

  **Only needed if Dan wants regular US access beyond tourist visa (90-day ESTA/B-1/B-2).**

- [ ] **5.4 — Update all banking and financial accounts**

  Notify all banks and financial institutions that Dan is no longer a US person:
  - Update W-8BEN (replacing W-9)
  - Remove FATCA reporting obligations
  - Update tax residency information
  - Provide CLN as proof

- [ ] **5.5 — Wife's ongoing compliance setup**

  Ensure wife has the following on autopilot:
  - US expat tax preparer (annual engagement for 1040 + 2555 + FBAR + 8938)
  - Calendar reminders for filing deadlines
  - 330-day tracker (she cannot spend more than 35 days in the US per 12-month period for FEIE 330-day test)
  - Form 3520 filing if Dan gifts her > $100K/yr

---

## Phase 6: Steady State — Month 12+

**What ongoing operations look like once everything is in place:**

### OpEx Reserve Fund — The Safety Net (USDC Reserve)

The CI IBC's Fireblocks Reserve Wallet maintains a mandatory USDC operating reserve before any partner distributions:

| Parameter | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **Minimum reserve** | $600,000 USDC (12 months at $50K/mo burn) |
| **Target reserve** | $1,200,000 USDC (24 months at $50K/mo burn) |
| **Burn rate** | $50,000/month — all team salaries, contractors, Cyprus Studio, infrastructure |
| **Reserve location** | Fireblocks Reserve Wallet (multi-sig 2-of-3) |

**Buildup phase (OpEx Fund < $600K USDC):**
- All revenue after expenses goes to building the reserve
- Bonuses split **50/50** — half to OpEx Fund, half to bonus pool
- No quarterly distributions to partners until fund hits $600K USDC

**Funded phase (OpEx Fund ≥ $600K USDC):**
- Full bonuses paid out (100% to bonus pool)
- Quarterly distributions of profit above reserve via smart contract (30/30/30/10)
- Maintain fund above $600K USDC at all times, target $1M+
- Detailed thresholds and escalation decisions made as the business scales

### Monthly

| Task | Who | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| Client billing | CI IBC (LBC) | Invoice clients → clients pay via Stripe → USDC settles to Fireblocks |
| Pay Cyprus Studio | CI IBC → Studio | Monthly USDC → Circle off-ramp → EUR → Cyprus bank (cost-plus transfer) |
| Developer payroll | Cyprus Studio (LBS) | Pay salaries, social insurance via Cyprus EUR bank account |
| Contractor payments | CI IBC | Pay non-Cyprus contractors in USDC (crypto-native) or via Wise (fiat vendors) |
| Dan's contractor fee | CI IBC → Dan | USDC to Dan's self-custodied wallet |
| Wife's contractor fee | CI IBC → Wife | USDC to wallet or fiat via Circle off-ramp, $10,833/month |
| Bookkeeping | CI IBC + Studio | Record all transactions (Xero/QuickBooks + on-chain records via Fireblocks) |

### Quarterly (once OpEx Fund ≥ $600K USDC)

| Task | Who | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| Confirm OpEx Fund balance | CFO / Dan | Verify Fireblocks Reserve Wallet ≥ $600K USDC after all expenses |
| Calculate distributable profit | CI IBC Board | Revenue minus expenses minus reserve top-up = distributable amount |
| Declare CI IBC dividend | CI IBC Board | Board resolution declaring quarterly dividend (profit above reserve only) |
| CI IBC → S.A. | CI IBC | Distributable USDC to S.A. |
| Cyprus Studio → S.A. | LBS Board | Any excess profit after costs to S.A. (sole shareholder) |
| Declare S.A. dividend | S.A. Board | Board resolution distributing to all four shareholders |
| **Smart contract distribution** | S.A. / Automated | USDC sent to distribution smart contract → auto-splits 30/30/30/10 to founder wallets |
| PIFs → founders | Foundation Councils | Distribute to Dan and Nicholas per Private Regulations |

### Annually

| Task | Who | Cost |
|------|-----|------|
| CI IBC annual return | CI registered agent | Included in annual fee |
| CI IBC registered agent fee | Dan / CI IBC | ~$1,500-2,500 |
| Cyprus Studio audit | Cyprus auditor | ~$4,000 |
| Cyprus Studio annual return + corporate tax filing | Cyprus accountant | ~$2,500 |

## Budget Summary — What This All Costs

### One-Time Formation Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Grenada CBI (single applicant) | $252,000-295,000 |
| Paraguay residency (optional, parallel) | $8,000-12,000 |
| Panama PIFs formation (two foundations) | $6,000-10,000 |
| Panama S.A. formation | $2,000-3,500 |
| Cook Islands IBC formation | $3,000-5,000 |
| Cyprus Studio formation | $3,000-6,000 |
| Crypto treasury setup (Fireblocks + Circle + Stripe USDC) | $5,000-10,000 |
| Smart contract development + audit | $8,000-15,000 |
| Singapore bank opening (optional backup, incl. travel) | $0-2,500 |
| Cyprus bank opening (EUR payroll) | $500-1,000 |
| Legal counsel (US expat, Panama, CI, Cyprus) | $15,000-28,000 |
| Transfer pricing study (initial) | $8,000-12,000 |
| Shareholders' agreement (S.A. level) | $3,000-8,000 |
| MDSA drafting (CI IBC ↔ Cyprus Studio) | Included in TP study |
| Contractor agreement templates | $1,000-3,000 |
| US renunciation fee | $2,350 |
| Final US tax return preparation | $2,000-5,000 |
| **Total one-time (with Grenada)** | **~$316,500-413,500** |
| **Total one-time (without Grenada — if other citizenship available)** | **~$56,500-106,500** |

### Annual Ongoing Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| CI IBC maintenance | $2,500-4,500 |
| Cyprus Studio audit + tax filing | $6,500-10,000 |
| Cyprus Studio TP documentation update | $3,000-5,000 |
| Panama S.A. maintenance | $1,600-3,000 |
| Panama PIFs maintenance (two foundations) | $4,000-7,000 |
| Singapore bank | $200-500 |
| Cyprus bank | $200-600 |
| Wife's US tax prep | $1,500-3,000 |
| Jason's US tax prep (his expense) | $1,500-3,000 |
| **Total annual** | **~$21,000-36,600** |

### The ROI

| Scenario | Annual LB AI Revenue | Tax Under Current US Structure | Tax Under This Plan | Annual Savings |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-|
| Year 1 | $500,000 | ~$60-80K (Dan's US tax + entity overhead) | ~$27K (entity overhead + Cyprus 12.5% on markup) | **~$33-53K** |
| Year 3 | $1,500,000 | ~$150-250K | ~$30K | **~$120-220K** |
| Year 5 | $3,000,000+ | ~$300-500K+ | ~$35K | **~$265-465K+** |

The Grenada CBI cost ($252-295K) pays for itself within 2-4 years at modest revenue levels. The Cyprus Studio adds annual cost but the 12.5% tax only applies to the cost-plus markup (not full revenue), keeping the effective rate minimal.

## Emergency Scenarios

### "What if my net worth crosses $2M before I can renounce?"

Options:
1. **Accelerate renunciation** — some embassies have shorter wait times. Consider Bridgetown, Barbados or smaller Caribbean posts.
2. **Transfer assets to PIF before renunciation** — must be done carefully. If IRS views it as tax-motivated, it could be challenged. Expat tax attorney must advise.
3. **Accept covered expatriate status** — model the consequences. The ~40% gift tax to US persons is harsh, but if your wife earns $130K independently and you rarely gift her large amounts, the practical impact may be manageable.
4. **Defer equity issuance** — if S.A. shares haven't been issued to Dan's PIF yet, the business value doesn't appear on Dan's personal balance sheet. The PIF exists as an empty shell with minimal value.

### "What if Grenada CBI takes longer than 6 months?"

- Paraguay doesn't work as a renunciation backup (citizenship takes 3+ years)
- Consider Dominica CBI as faster alternative ($100K, 2-3 months faster in some cases)
- Do NOT renounce without a second citizenship — you'll be stateless, which creates severe travel and banking complications

### "What if Singapore banks won't open an account for the CI IBC?"

**With crypto-native architecture, this is no longer a critical risk.** The primary treasury operates on USDC via Fireblocks. Singapore bank is an optional fiat backup, not a dependency.

If a fiat backup is still desired:
- Hong Kong (Statrys, HSBC) — accepts CI IBCs
- Mauritius — more flexible KYC for offshore structures
- EMI (Electronic Money Institution) — Mercury, Relay (may accept CI IBCs with PIF ownership)
- Panama (through the S.A.) — as a fallback primary account

### "What if wife needs to spend more than 35 days in the US?"

She fails the 330-day test for FEIE. Options:
- **Bona fide residence test** — if she has genuine foreign residence (lease, local bank account, community ties), she may qualify under this test instead. It's a facts-and-circumstances determination — less clean than the 330-day test.
- **Increase salary above $130K** and pay the tax on the overage. At $175K, she pays ~$5,600 in federal tax. Not ideal, but manageable.
- **Limit US visits to 35 days** — this is the simplest solution. Short visits for family, holidays, etc.

*This is an actionable execution plan for forming Light Brands AI as a four-entity structure (PIF → S.A. → LBC Cook Islands IBC / LBS Cyprus Studio) with Panama PIF asset protection, and for Daniel Lawless to renounce US citizenship while avoiding covered expatriate status. Timelines are estimates based on standard processing times for Grenada CBI, Panama entity formation, Cook Islands IBC incorporation, Cyprus company formation, and US renunciation procedures as of February 2026. Actual timelines may vary. All actions should be validated by qualified professionals: US expat tax attorney, Cook Islands registered agent, Panama PIF counsel, Cyprus corporate counsel, transfer pricing advisor, and Grenada CBI authorized agent. This is not legal or tax advice.*
