## 1. Executive Summary {#1-executive-summary}

Light Brands AI is a new AI consulting, SaaS, and product company. Nothing has been formed. Nothing has been signed. This document specifies the corporate structure from scratch.

### Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Real equity ownership** | Founders hold actual shares (not phantom equity, not PPAs). Standard corporate mechanics. |
| **Minimum viable structure** | Three entities total. No unnecessary jurisdictions. |
| **Zero entity-level tax** | PIF (0%) → S.A. (0% territorial) → CI IBC (0% unconditional). Total entity tax: $0. |
| **100% remote** | No office, no employees on payroll. Contractors + EOR worldwide. |
| **Asset protection** | Panama PIF + Cook Islands IBC = strongest protection stack available. |
| **Divorce protection** | Dan's equity held through PIF, not personally. PIF is independent legal person. |
| **Simplicity** | One revenue entity, one holding company, one foundation. Done. |

### The Math

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total entities | **3** |
| Total annual overhead | **~$7-13K** |
| Entity-level tax rate | **0%** |
| Dan's personal tax rate (post-renunciation) | **0%** |
| Wife's personal tax rate ($130K salary via FEIE) | **0%** |
| Combined household tax | **$0-$7,400/yr** (only if wife has additional income beyond FEIE) |

### Why Each Entity Exists

| Entity | Why It Exists | What Happens Without It |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Panama PIF** | Asset protection. Divorce protection. Dan's equity is held by an independent legal person, not Dan personally. | Dan's shares are personal property — exposed in divorce, lawsuits, creditor claims |
| **Light Brands Holdings S.A.** | Intermediate holding company between PIF and CI IBC. Required because PIF cannot directly hold shares in a CI IBC (PIF acts through a corporate vehicle). Also provides banking flexibility and double-layer protection. | PIF would need to hold CI IBC shares directly (may not be accepted by CI registered agent) |
| **Light Brands AI Ltd (CI IBC)** | The operating entity. Holds all revenue, IP, contracts. 0% tax. Strongest asset protection jurisdiction globally. | No business entity exists |

### Why NOT Dubai

| Dubai Element | Why It Was Considered | Why It's Unnecessary |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| FZ-LLC with QFZP status | 0% corporate tax + employs team for substance | CI IBC is already 0% with no substance requirement |
| Golden Visa | FEIE bona fide residence for US tax | Dan won't be a US citizen — no FEIE needed for him |
| Office space | Required for FZ-LLC license | 100% remote team — no office needed anywhere |
| Employment visas | Legal employment for team members | Team are contractors, not employees |
| **Saved: ~$35-65K/yr** | | |

---

## 4. Ownership & Cap Table {#4-ownership-and-cap-table}

### Real Equity — Not Phantom Equity

Previous planning documents referenced PPAs (Profit Participation Agreements) — phantom equity that mimics real ownership without triggering US tax consequences. PPAs existed because the lead founder was a US citizen, and real ownership of foreign corporations triggers CFC, GILTI, and Form 5471 requirements.

**With Dan renouncing US citizenship before formation, PPAs are unnecessary.** Real shares are simpler, standard, and enforceable under corporate law.

### Cap Table: Light Brands AI Ltd

| Shareholder | Shares | Ownership | Held Through | Residence/Citizenship |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Light Brands Holdings S.A.** (Dan's PIF vehicle) | 300 | **30%** | PIF → S.A. → shares | Dan: Grenada citizen, Costa Rica/Panama resident |
| **Nicholas Courschesne** | 300 | **30%** | Direct (or personal holding entity) | Cyprus |
| **Andreas Demou** | 300 | **30%** | Direct (or personal holding entity) | Cyprus |
| **Jason Sparks** | 100 | **10%** | Direct | US citizen |
| **Total** | **1,000** | **100%** | | |

### Share Structure

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Authorized shares | 1,000 ordinary shares |
| Par value | $1.00 per share |
| Issued shares | 1,000 |
| Share classes | Single class (one vote per share) |
| Vesting | As agreed by founders (recommend 4-year vest, 1-year cliff) |
| Transfer restrictions | Board approval required. Right of first refusal for existing shareholders. |

### How Dan's Equity Is Protected

```
Dan (personally) owns NOTHING in Light Brands AI Ltd.

Instead:

Fundación Light Brands (PIF)
    → 100% owns Light Brands Holdings S.A.
        → S.A. holds 300 shares (30%) in Light Brands AI Ltd

Dan is a BENEFICIARY of the PIF.
Dan is NOT a shareholder, director, or officer of the S.A.
Dan IS a director of Light Brands AI Ltd (operational role).

In divorce:
    Dan's personal assets = divisible
    PIF assets = NOT divisible (independent legal person under Panama Law 25)
    S.A. shares = owned by PIF, not Dan
    CI IBC shares = owned by S.A., not Dan

Result: Dan's 30% equity is protected by three legal layers.
```

### What Each Founder Owns

| Founder | Economic Rights | Voting Rights | Dividend Rights | Board Seat |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Dan (via S.A.) | 30% of distributable profits | 30% of votes | 30% of declared dividends | Yes (Director) |
| Nicholas | 30% of distributable profits | 30% of votes | 30% of declared dividends | Yes (Director) |
| Andreas | 30% of distributable profits | 30% of votes | 30% of declared dividends | Yes (Director) |
| Jason | 10% of distributable profits | 10% of votes | 10% of declared dividends | Optional |

## 5. Entity Detail: Panama PIF {#5-panama-pif}

### Fundación Light Brands

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Private Interest Foundation (Fundación de Interés Privado) |
| **Governing law** | Panama Law 25 of June 12, 1995 |
| **Legal status** | Independent legal person — not a trust, not a company |
| **"Owner"** | None. A PIF has no owner. The founder creates it, endows it, and it becomes independent. |
| **Founder** | Dan Lawless (irrevocable after formation) |
| **Foundation Council** | 3 members minimum — manages the PIF. At least 1 must be Panamanian resident (typically the registered agent's nominee). |
| **Protector** | Independent advisor (optional but recommended). Can veto Foundation Council decisions, replace Council members. |
| **Beneficiaries** | Dan Lawless, Nicholas Courschesne, Andreas Demou. **NOT wife. NOT Jason Sparks (US citizen).** |
| **Foundation Charter** | Public document filed with Panama Public Registry. States name, registered agent, Foundation Council members, initial endowment. Does NOT name beneficiaries. |
| **Private Regulations** | Private document. Names beneficiaries, distribution rules, succession. NOT filed publicly. |
| **Registered agent** | Required — must be a Panamanian law firm |
| **Initial endowment** | Minimum $10,000 (typically in cash) |

### Tax Treatment

| Income Type | Tax Rate |
|-------------|----------|
| Foreign-source income (dividends from S.A.) | **0%** |
| Foreign-source interest | **0%** |
| Foreign-source capital gains | **0%** |
| Distributions to non-Panamanian beneficiaries | **0% WHT** |
| Local Panamanian income | 25% (not applicable — PIF has no Panama operations) |

### PIF Beneficiary Structure

| Beneficiary | Share of Distributions | Why Included |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Dan Lawless | Per Private Regulations | Lead founder, non-US citizen |
| Nicholas Courschesne | Per Private Regulations | Co-founder, Cyprus resident |
| Andreas Demou | Per Private Regulations | Co-founder, Cyprus resident |

**Excluded:**

| Person | Why Excluded |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wife** | US citizen. Beneficial interest in a foreign entity creates complex IRS reporting (Form 3520-A, potential foreign trust treatment). She receives money through contractor fees and gifts from Dan instead. |
| **Jason Sparks** | US citizen. PIF beneficiary status could create foreign trust attribution under IRC 679/684. He receives dividends as a direct shareholder of the CI IBC. |

### Annual Requirements

| Requirement | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Registered agent fee | ~$1,000-2,000/yr |
| Government annual fee | ~$400/yr |
| Foundation Council fees (if nominees used) | ~$500-1,000/yr |
| **Total** | **~$2,000-3,500/yr** |

---

## 6. Entity Detail: Panamanian Holdings S.A. {#6-panamanian-holdings-sa}

### Light Brands Holdings S.A.

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Sociedad Anónima (Panamanian corporation) |
| **Governing law** | Panama Law 32 of 1927 |
| **Sole shareholder** | Fundación Light Brands (PIF) |
| **Directors** | 3 minimum under Panama law. Nominee directors from registered agent + PIF Foundation Council overlap |
| **Officers** | President, Secretary, Treasurer (can be same as directors) |
| **Purpose** | Hold 30% equity in Light Brands AI Ltd (CI IBC) on behalf of PIF |
| **Registered agent** | Same firm as PIF (simplifies) |
| **Bearer shares** | Not used (eliminated by Panama in 2015 — all shares must be registered or immobilized) |

### Tax Treatment

| Income Type | Tax Rate |
|-------------|----------|
| Dividends received from CI IBC (foreign-source) | **0%** (territorial — Panama only taxes domestic income) |
| Capital gains on foreign assets | **0%** |
| Dividends paid to PIF (sole shareholder) | **0% WHT** |

### Why This Entity Exists

The S.A. serves as the **corporate vehicle** through which the PIF holds equity. This is standard practice because:

1. **CI registered agents** prefer corporate shareholders — cleaner KYC than a PIF directly holding shares
2. **Double-layer protection** — a creditor must pierce both the PIF and the S.A. to reach CI IBC shares
3. **Banking flexibility** — the S.A. can hold bank accounts for operational purposes
4. **Standard mechanics** — dividends flow CI IBC → S.A. → PIF → beneficiaries through well-understood corporate channels

### Annual Requirements

| Requirement | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Registered agent fee | ~$800-1,500/yr |
| Government annual franchise tax | ~$300-500/yr |
| Nominee director fees (if used) | ~$500-1,000/yr |
| **Total** | **~$1,600-3,000/yr** |

---

## 7. Entity Detail: Light Brands AI Ltd (Cook Islands IBC) {#7-light-brands-ai-ltd}

### The Operating Entity

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | International Business Company |
| **Governing law** | Cook Islands International Companies Act 1981-82 |
| **Registered agent** | Required — licensed CI trustee company in Rarotonga |
| **Registered office** | At registered agent's address |
| **Share capital** | 1,000 ordinary shares at $1.00 par value |
| **Shareholders** | See cap table (Section 4) — four shareholders |
| **Directors** | Dan Lawless (operational) + nominee director (CI or Singapore) |
| **Secretary** | Optional (recommended) |
| **Employees** | Zero. All team are contractors. |
| **Office space** | None. Registered office only. |
| **Public registry** | Company name, agent, incorporation date. Directors/shareholders are private. |

| Licensing/royalty income | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Interest income | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Capital gains | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Dividends paid to shareholders | **0% WHT** | No withholding on IBC distributions |

**The 0% is unconditional.** No substance requirements. No qualifying activity test. No revenue threshold. As long as the entity does not transact with Cook Islands residents or hold CI real property.

### What This Entity Does

Everything:

- Holds the Singapore bank account (primary operating account)
- Manages operational expenses (cloud infrastructure, SaaS tools, marketing)

### What This Entity Does NOT Do

- Employ anyone (zero payroll)
- Maintain physical office space (zero premises)
- Conduct business with Cook Islands residents
- Hold Cook Islands real property
- Have 3+ CI-resident directors (which would trigger domestic tax)

### Annual Requirements

| Requirement | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Registered agent annual fee | ~$1,500-2,500/yr |
| Government annual license | ~$300-500/yr |
| Nominee director fee | ~$500-1,000/yr |
| Bank account maintenance (Singapore) | ~$200-500/yr |
| **Total** | **~$2,500-4,500/yr** |

---

## 8. Founder Roles & Compensation {#8-founder-compensation}

### How Founders Get Paid

With real equity, founders receive income through two standard corporate channels:

| Channel | Mechanism | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Dividends** | Board declares dividend. Distributed pro-rata by shareholding. | Quarterly (recommended) |
| **Contractor/director fees** | For active founders providing services. CI IBC pays per contractor agreement. | Monthly |

### Dan's Compensation (Post-Renunciation)

| Channel | Amount | Tax to Dan | Rate |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| Director/contractor fee | $120-250K/yr | $0 (Grenada citizen, territorial country resident) | **0%** |
| Dividends (30% of declared dividends) | Variable — based on profits | $0 (0% WHT from CI, 0% in Panama, 0% PIF → beneficiary) | **0%** |
| PIF distributions (from retained earnings) | As needed | $0 | **0%** |
| **Total effective rate** | | | **0%** |

Dan's dividend path: CI IBC → S.A. (0% WHT) → PIF (0% Panama territorial) → Dan (0% distribution, territorial country)

### Nicholas & Andreas (Cyprus Residents)

| Channel | Tax Treatment |
|---------|--------------|
| Director/contractor fee | Taxed in Cyprus at personal rates (0% on first €19,500, 20-35% above) |
| Dividends from CI IBC | Cyprus taxes dividends at 17% Special Defence Contribution on dividends from companies not meeting substance tests. **Counsel should model this.** |

**Note for Nicholas/Andreas:** They may benefit from holding their shares through their own holding entities (Cyprus IPCo or Maltese holding) to optimize dividend taxation. This is separate from Dan's PIF structure and should be modeled by their tax advisors.

### Jason's Compensation (US Citizen)

See [Section 16](#16-jason-sparks) for full US-specific analysis.

| Channel | Tax Treatment |
|---------|--------------|
| Contractor fee | Ordinary income, taxed at US rates. FEIE available if abroad 330+ days. |
| Dividends (10% of declared) | Qualified foreign corporation dividends — 15-20% capital gains rate. Subject to PFIC analysis. |

---

## 9. Wife's Position {#9-wife-position}

### Core Principle: She Is Outside the Corporate Structure

Wife is a US citizen. Giving her equity in a foreign corporation triggers Form 5471, potential CFC issues, and complex reporting. Instead:

| What She Is | What She Is NOT |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Contractor of CI IBC | Shareholder of CI IBC |
| Paid a salary/fee for real services | Equity holder |
| Protected by marriage agreement | PIF beneficiary |
| Receives gifts from Dan (unlimited, tax-free if Dan avoids covered expatriate) | Director or officer of any entity |

### Her Income Structure

| Source | Amount | Tax Treatment | Federal Tax |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Contractor fee from CI IBC** | $130,000/yr | Excluded by FEIE (Form 2555) | **$0** |
| **Gifts from Dan** | Unlimited | Not income. Report on Form 3520 if > $100K/yr from foreign person | **$0** |

### FEIE Requirements

For the $130K exclusion to apply, she must:

1. Have a **tax home** in a foreign country (live abroad)
2. Meet the **330-day test** (cannot spend more than 35 days in the US per 12-month period) OR the **bona fide residence test** (genuine foreign residence for full calendar year)

### Her Annual US Filing Obligations

| Form | Purpose | Penalty for Non-Filing |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Form 1040 | Annual income tax return | Standard IRS penalties |
| Form 2555 | Claim FEIE exclusion | Loses the exclusion |
| FBAR (FinCEN 114) | Report foreign accounts > $10K aggregate | $10K+ per account per year |
| Form 8938 | Report foreign financial assets > $200K (overseas filer threshold) | $10K + continuing penalties |
| Form 3520 | Report gifts from Dan if > $100K | $10K or 35% of gross gift |

### Divorce Protection for Wife

Per the marriage agreement, wife receives half of everything. Her protections:

| Protection | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Independent income** | Her contractor fee continues regardless of marriage status |
| **Marriage agreement** | Entitles her to 50% of marital assets |
| **Dan's personal assets** | Whatever Dan holds personally is divisible |
| **PIF assets** | NOT divisible — PIF is independent legal person. This is a trade-off: PIF protects Dan's equity from divorce, but wife's 50% claim only reaches Dan's personal assets. |

**The honest reality:** The PIF means wife's divorce claim cannot reach the 30% CI IBC equity. She can reach Dan's personal assets (bank accounts, property, personal investments). If the marriage agreement is important, Dan should maintain meaningful personal assets outside the PIF — or the agreement should account for PIF distributions.

## 10. Remote Team Structure {#10-remote-team}

### The Model: Zero Employees, All Contractors

Light Brands AI Ltd has zero employees. The entire team operates as independent contractors or through Employer of Record (EOR) services.

### Engagement Methods

| Method | Best For | Cost | How It Works |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Direct contractor agreement** | Senior devs, specialists, long-term team | $0 platform fee | CI IBC signs agreement directly. Contractor invoices monthly. Paid via Wise. |
| **Deel Contractor** | Mid-tier contractors who want simple payments | ~$49/month per person | Deel manages contract, payments, compliance. CI IBC pays Deel. |
| **Deel EOR** | Team in countries with strict labor laws (EU, Brazil, India) | ~$500-700/month per person | Deel legally employs the person. CI IBC pays Deel. No PE risk. |

### Permanent Establishment (PE) Risk Management

If a contractor works exclusively for CI IBC from one country, that country could argue CI IBC has a PE there — subjecting profits to local tax.

| Mitigation | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Use EOR for high-risk countries | The EOR is the legal employer — CI IBC has no presence |
| Contractor independence | Multiple clients, own equipment, flexible schedule, not on CI IBC's org chart |
| Geographic distribution | Don't concentrate 80%+ of the team in one country |
| No physical office anywhere | CI IBC has no premises — contractors work from home/coworking |
| Governance in Cook Islands | Board decisions via nominee director in CI |

## 11. IP Ownership {#11-ip-ownership}

### All IP Belongs to Light Brands AI Ltd

```
Contractor builds software / AI model / framework / product
    │
    ▼
IP assigned to Light Brands AI Ltd (CI IBC)
    via contractor agreement IP assignment clause
    │
    ▼
CI IBC owns all IP — can license, sell, distribute, sublicense
```

### Required Contract Clauses (Every Contractor Agreement)

1. **IP assignment / work-for-hire:** All work product, inventions, and IP created during the engagement belong to Light Brands AI Ltd
2. **Pre-existing IP exclusion:** Contractor retains their own pre-existing tools (specifically enumerated in the agreement)
3. **Moral rights waiver:** Where applicable under contractor's local law
4. **Confidentiality:** Standard NDA provisions
5. **Non-compete:** As enforceable in contractor's jurisdiction (typically narrow scope)

### No Separate IP Entity Needed

The CI IBC owns IP directly. There is no need for:
- A Delaware IP holding company (no US operations)
- A Dutch royalty conduit (no treaty routing needed)
- A separate licensing entity (CI IBC licenses directly)

IP licensing to third parties (if any) is done directly by the CI IBC. Royalty income is 0% taxed.

### Cost in Context

| Annual LB AI Revenue | Entity Overhead | Overhead as % of Revenue |
|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| $250,000 | ~$9K | 3.6% |
| $500,000 | ~$9K | 1.8% |
| $1,000,000 | ~$9K | 0.9% |
| $2,000,000+ | ~$9K | < 0.5% |

### What You're NOT Paying

| Item | Cost Avoided |
|------|-------------|
| Dubai FZ-LLC (license, office, visas, audit) | ~$35-65K/yr |
| Cayman Holdings (registered office, compliance) | ~$5-10K/yr |
| Corporate income tax | $0 saved vs $0 (both structures are 0%) |
| Dan's personal US tax (post-renunciation) | $85-117K/yr saved at Y5 |
| Form 5471 preparation | ~$1-3K/yr per form saved |

---

## 15. Governance & Decision-Making {#15-governance}

### Board of Directors (CI IBC)

| Director | Role | Authority |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Dan Lawless | Managing Director | Day-to-day operations, client relationships, product direction |
| Nominee Director (CI or Singapore) | Governance director | Signs routine filings, provides CI governance nexus |
| (Optional) Nicholas or Andreas | Board member | Strategic direction, major decisions |

### Decision Thresholds

| Decision | Required Approval |
|----------|-------------------|
| Day-to-day operations (contracts < $X, hiring contractors) | Managing Director alone |
| Major contracts (> threshold TBD) | Board majority |
| Declare dividends | Board resolution (majority) |
| Issue new shares / dilute | Shareholder vote (>50% or as per Articles) |
| Sell the company / IP | Supermajority (75% or unanimous — per Articles) |
| Change Articles of Association | Shareholder special resolution |

### Shareholder Agreement

A shareholders' agreement should be executed between all four shareholders covering:

1. **Vesting schedule** — 4-year vest, 1-year cliff (recommended)
2. **Right of first refusal** — existing shareholders can buy shares before outside sale
3. **Tag-along / drag-along** — standard protections for minority shareholders
4. **Non-compete** — founders agree not to compete during involvement
5. **Deadlock resolution** — what happens if 30/30/30 founders disagree
6. **Departure terms** — what happens to unvested shares if a founder leaves
7. **Valuation methodology** — how shares are valued for transfers
8. **Dividend policy** — minimum distribution frequency and percentage
9. **Reserved matters** — decisions requiring supermajority or unanimity

## 16. Jason Sparks — US Citizen Considerations {#16-jason-sparks}

### The Trade-Off: Real Equity vs. Phantom Equity

With PPAs (phantom equity), Jason avoids Form 5471. With real 10% equity, he triggers filing requirements but has genuine ownership rights.

| Factor | PPA (Phantom Equity) | Real 10% Equity |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Economic rights | Contractual right to 10% of profits | 10% shareholder — dividends, voting, sale proceeds |
| Form 5471 | Likely not required (counsel confirm) | **Required** (Category 3 or 4 filer) |
| CFC status of CI IBC | Not relevant (PPA holder ≠ shareholder) | CI IBC is **NOT a CFC** (US shareholders hold only 10%, need >50% for CFC) |
| GILTI | Not applicable | Not applicable (CI IBC is not a CFC) |
| PFIC risk | Not applicable | **Possible** — if CI IBC's income is primarily passive. Consulting revenue is active. SaaS revenue classification depends on facts. Counsel must analyze. |
| Dividend taxation | Ordinary income (PPA distributions) | Qualified dividends (15-20%) if CI IBC is a qualified foreign corporation |
| Sale/exit proceeds | Contractual payout per PPA terms | Capital gains (long-term if held > 1 year) |
| Legal enforceability | Contractual — only as strong as the agreement | Shareholder rights under CI corporate law |

### Recommendation for Jason

**Give Jason real equity (10% shares).** Here's why:

1. **CI IBC is not a CFC** — total US ownership is only 10% (need >50% for CFC). No GILTI, no Subpart F.
2. **Form 5471 is manageable** — annual filing, ~$1-3K in preparation fees. Not pleasant, but not catastrophic.
3. **Real equity is real ownership** — voting rights, shareholder protections, sale proceeds. PPAs can be disputed or restructured by other founders.
4. **PFIC risk must be analyzed** — if consulting revenue dominates (it should for an AI consulting firm), the company is not a PFIC. If passive income (SaaS subscriptions) dominates, PFIC analysis becomes important.

### Jason's Annual US Obligations

| Filing | Required? | Detail |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Form 1040 | Yes | Standard US tax return |
| Form 5471 | **Yes** | Report ownership in foreign corporation |
| Schedule B (Part III) | Yes | Report foreign account interests |
| FBAR | Yes (if foreign accounts > $10K) | If Jason has signatory authority on any CI IBC account |
| Form 8938 | Depends on threshold | If foreign financial assets exceed filing threshold |

---

## 17. Open Questions for Counsel {#17-open-questions}

### Critical (Before Formation)

1. **Jason's PFIC exposure:** Is Light Brands AI Ltd (CI IBC) a PFIC if revenue is primarily consulting + SaaS? What percentage of revenue must be "active" to avoid PFIC classification?

2. **Wife's contractor arrangement and FEIE:** Does wife working as a contractor (not employee) of the CI IBC qualify for FEIE? FEIE requires "earned income" — confirm contractor income from a foreign entity qualifies.

3. **PIF beneficiary distributions and Dan's tax residence:** If Dan resides in Costa Rica (territorial tax) or Panama (territorial tax), confirm PIF distributions are not taxable in either jurisdiction.

4. **S.A. as shareholder of CI IBC — CI registered agent acceptance:** Will CI registered agents accept a Panamanian S.A. (owned by a PIF) as a shareholder? Any KYC complications?

5. **Covered expatriate and business value:** Dan's 30% equity in CI IBC (even pre-formation, if deals are in progress) — does the IRS count anticipated business value toward the $2M net worth test? Or only assets held at the date of renunciation?

6. **Vesting and covered expatriate:** If shares are subject to 4-year vesting, are unvested shares counted in the $2M net worth calculation?

### Important (During Formation)

7. **Nicholas and Andreas — Cyprus dividend tax on CI IBC distributions:** What is the effective Cyprus tax rate on dividends received from a Cook Islands IBC? Does the CI IBC meet Cyprus "substance" requirements for reduced dividend taxation?

8. **Shareholders' agreement — governing law:** Should the shareholders' agreement be governed by Cook Islands law (where the company is incorporated), Singapore law (neutral, sophisticated), or English law (standard for international commercial agreements)?

9. **Dan as director of CI IBC — PE risk:** If Dan (Costa Rica resident) serves as director and performs management functions, does this create a PE for the CI IBC in Costa Rica? Mitigation: nominee CI director makes board decisions, Dan provides advisory services under contractor agreement.

10. **Transfer pricing — is it needed?** In a single-entity structure (CI IBC only), there are no intercompany transactions to price. The CI IBC pays contractors at market rates. No TP study should be needed. Confirm.

11. **Singapore bank — which banks accept CI IBCs with PIF ownership?** Current market: DBS, OCBC, Statrys, Aspire — which are currently onboarding CI IBCs?

12. **Deel and CI IBC:** Does Deel accept a Cook Islands IBC as a client entity for EOR and contractor management? Any restrictions?

### Future Planning

13. **Adding new shareholders (future hires with equity):** Process for issuing new shares from authorized but unissued capital. Should we authorize more than 1,000 shares initially for future grants?

14. **Converting to a different structure later:** If Light Brands AI grows to the point where a holding company structure (Cayman, Singapore, etc.) makes more sense for investors/acquisition, how complex is the conversion from CI IBC?

15. **Church IP licensing (future):** When the international church is established, Light Brands AI may license spiritual/consciousness technology to it. Structure: CI IBC → Church (royalty license). No current planning needed — flag for future.

*This document specifies the corporate formation plan for Light Brands AI — an AI consulting, SaaS, and product company structured through a Cook Islands IBC with Panama PIF asset protection. All tax treatments described are based on current law in the Cook Islands (International Companies Act 1981-82), Panama (Law 25 of 1995, Law 32 of 1927), and the US Internal Revenue Code (FEIE under IRC 911, covered expatriate rules under IRC 877A). Real equity ownership replaces previous phantom equity (PPA) planning. Implementation requires validation by Cook Islands registered agent, Panama PIF counsel, US expat tax attorney, and Singapore banking specialist. This is not legal or tax advice.*
