# Cook Islands IBC: Light Brands AI Ltd (LBC) — Operating Detail

> **Status:** Entity specification — requires Cook Islands counsel + Cyprus counsel validation
> **Last Updated:** February 2026
> **Structure:** PIF → Panama Holdings S.A. → LBC (Cook Islands IBC) / LBS (Cyprus Studio)

---

## 1. Summary

Light Brands AI Ltd (LBC) is a Cook Islands International Business Company (IBC) that serves as the consulting principal — "The Brain" — for all external consulting, SaaS, and product sales. It signs contracts with external clients, collects revenue, owns LB-specific IP, and subcontracts all development to Light Brands Studio Ltd (LBS), a Cyprus Private Company. LBC has zero employees, zero office space, and zero physical presence — by design. This "thin" entity structure preserves its unconditional 0% tax rate on international income while the Cyprus Studio provides all operational substance (real office, real employees, real development work).

LBC is 100% owned by Light Brands Holdings S.A. (Panama), which is in turn owned by four shareholders: Dan's PIF (30%), Nicholas's PIF (30%), Andreas Demou (30%), and Jason Sparks (10%).

## 2. Why Cook Islands (Not Other Jurisdictions)

| Jurisdiction | Tax on International Income | Substance Required? | Asset Protection | OECD/FATF/EU Standing | Annual Cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cook Islands** | **0%** (unconditional for IBCs) | **No** — no employees, office, or local activity required | **#1 globally** (2-year statute of limitations, fraudulent transfer burden on creditor, no foreign judgment recognition) | Clean — not on EU blacklist, FATF compliant, TIEA signatory | ~$3-5K | **Selected** |
| BVI | 0% | No | Good but weaker than CI | EU blacklisted (removed 2023, watch list risk) | ~$2-4K | EU risk |
| Cayman | 0% | No (but increasing pressure) | Good | Clean, but OECD pressure increasing | ~$5-8K | Higher cost, more scrutiny |
| Panama IBC | 0% (territorial) | No | Good (different from PIF) | EU greylist risk | ~$2-3K | Having PIF + IBC in same jurisdiction looks like layering |
| Seychelles | 0% | No | Moderate | FATF greylist | ~$1-2K | Reputational risk |
| Nevis | 0% | No | Excellent | Limited banking relationships | ~$2-3K | Banking difficulty |

**Cook Islands wins on three dimensions:**

1. **Asset protection** — strongest in the world. The International Trusts Act 1984 (as amended) and the International Companies Act 1981-82 create a jurisdiction where: creditors face a 2-year statute of limitations from the date of transfer (not discovery), must prove fraudulent intent beyond reasonable doubt (not preponderance), and foreign court judgments are not recognized or enforceable.

2. **Clean international standing** — the Cook Islands is not on any EU blacklist or FATF greylist. It has signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) and participates in CRS/AEOI. This is critical for banking relationships and intercompany transactions.

3. **Zero substance requirements** — unlike jurisdictions facing increasing economic substance demands (Cayman ESR, BVI Economic Substance Act), Cook Islands IBCs have no minimum substance requirements for international business. The entity can be a pure holding/IP/contracting vehicle.

## 3. IBC Formation and Governance

### Formation Requirements

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Governing law** | Cook Islands International Companies Act 1981-82 |
| **Registered agent** | Required — must be a licensed CI trustee company |
| **Registered office** | At the registered agent's address in Rarotonga |
| **Directors** | Minimum 1 director. Can be corporate or individual. No CI residency requirement. **Critical: fewer than 3 CI-resident directors** to avoid local tax obligations. |
| **Shareholders** | Minimum 1. **Light Brands Holdings S.A. (Panama) is 100% sole shareholder.** S.A. is owned by: Dan's PIF (30%), Nicholas's PIF (30%), Andreas Demou (30%), Jason Sparks (10%). |
| **Secretary** | Optional (recommended for governance) |
| **Share capital** | Flexible — standard is USD $10,000 authorized, $1 issued |
| **Public registry** | Company name, registered agent, date of incorporation. Directors and shareholders are NOT public. |
| **Formation time** | 2-5 business days |
| **Formation cost** | ~$1,500-2,500 (agent fees + government fees) |

### Director Structure (Recommended)

| Director | Role | Residence |
|---|---|---|
| Professional corporate director (nominee) | Day-to-day signing authority for routine matters | Cook Islands or Singapore |
| Dan Lawless | Strategic direction (via board resolutions) | Panama / Costa Rica (post-renunciation) |

**Key constraint:** The CI IBC must NOT have 3 or more Cook Islands-resident directors. Under the International Companies Act, a company with 3+ CI-resident directors becomes subject to Cook Islands domestic tax law. Keep CI-resident directors to 1 (the nominee) or 0.

### Annual Requirements

| Requirement | Detail | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Annual return | Filed with Registrar via registered agent | Included in agent fee |
| Registered agent fee | Annual maintenance | ~$1,500-2,500/yr |
| Government annual fee | License renewal | ~$300-500/yr |
| Financial statements | Not required to be filed (keep internally for intercompany TP) | — |
| Audit | Not required | — |
| **Total annual cost** | | **~$2,500-4,000** |

## 4. Tax Treatment

### Income Tax

| Income Type | Tax Rate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| International consulting revenue | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| International SaaS/subscription revenue | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Royalty income (from licensing IP) | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Interest income | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Capital gains | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |
| Dividends received | **0%** | IBC international income exemption |

### Withholding Tax

| Payment Type | WHT Rate |
|---|---|
| Dividends paid by CI IBC to Panamanian Holdings S.A. | **0%** |
| Royalties paid by CI IBC to any entity | **0%** |
| Service fees paid by CI IBC to Cyprus Studio | **0%** |
| Interest paid by CI IBC | **0%** |

**The 0% is unconditional for IBCs.** There is no minimum substance requirement, no qualifying activity test, and no revenue threshold. As long as the entity does not conduct business with Cook Islands residents or hold Cook Islands real property, the 0% rate applies.

### What Would Break the 0% Rate

| Action | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Conducting business with CI residents | Subject to CI domestic tax |
| Holding CI real property | Subject to CI property tax |
| Having 3+ CI-resident directors | Company becomes domestically taxable |
| Employees physically located in CI | Creates CI substance — potential domestic tax |

None of these apply to Light Brands AI Ltd (LBC).

## 5. IP Ownership and Work-for-Hire Structure

### How LB IP Is Created

1. **CI IBC commissions the work** — LBC enters into a Master Development Services Agreement (MDSA) with Light Brands Studio Ltd (Cyprus)
2. **Cyprus Studio builds it** — the Cyprus team (employees of LBS, led by Andreas Demou) develops the software, frameworks, tools from a real office in Limassol/Nicosia
3. **IP transfers to CI IBC upon creation** — the MDSA specifies that all IP in the deliverables is assigned to LBC as the commissioning party (work-for-hire / IP assignment clause)
4. **CI IBC owns the IP** — it can license, sell, or distribute as it sees fit

### Why This Structure Works

- **Cyprus Studio provides genuine OECD-compliant substance** — real office, real employees, real development work. This is not a shell entity.
- **CI IBC is the commissioning principal** for LB-related IP — standard OECD principal/routine service provider model
- **No IP migration issues** — the IP was never "in" the Cyprus entity. It was created under contract for CI IBC from inception
- **TP defensibility** — the cost-plus fee (actual costs + 8-12% markup) is the arm's length price for captive development services. Standard comparables exist (IT outsourcing benchmarks, captive center studies)

### IP Licensing to Church

| License | From | To | Type | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spiritual technology tools | CI IBC | Church | Royalty license | Arm's length (TP study) |
| Consciousness platforms | CI IBC | Church | Royalty license | Arm's length (TP study) |

**Church treatment:** Royalty income received by a 508(c)(1)(A) church is UBIT-exempt under IRC 512(b)(2), provided the underlying property is not debt-financed. The church licenses the tools for its spiritual mission — distributing consciousness technology to its congregation.

**Pricing:** The royalty rate must be defensible. Comparable rates for software/technology licensing to nonprofits typically range from 5-15% of revenue generated using the licensed technology. A TP study should establish the specific rate.

## 6. Development Relationship with Cyprus Studio

### Structure

```
Light Brands AI Ltd (CI IBC / LBC) — "The Brain"
    Signs client contracts (consulting, SaaS, products)
    Collects client payment
    Owns all IP
    Subcontracts all development to:

Light Brands Studio Ltd (Cyprus / LBS) — "The Hands"
    Provides all development, implementation, support
    Real office in Limassol/Nicosia with employed developers
    Led by Andreas Demou (Executive Director)
    Bills LBC at cost + 8-12% arm's length margin
    Delivers work product with IP assigned to LBC upon creation
```

**OECD principal/routine service provider model:** LBC (CI IBC) is the entrepreneurial principal — it bears market risk, owns IP, acquires clients, and makes strategic decisions. LBS (Cyprus Studio) is the routine service provider — it performs development functions under contract, earns a cost-plus return, and assumes no market risk. This is a well-established OECD transfer pricing model with abundant comparable data.

### Key Contractual Terms (MDSA)

| Term | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Agreement** | Master Development Services Agreement (MDSA) |
| **Scope** | All software development, consulting delivery, implementation, and technical support for LB clients |
| **Pricing** | Cost-plus method (actual costs + 8-12% markup). Benchmarked against captive development center comparables. |
| **IP assignment** | All deliverables and IP created under the MDSA are assigned to LBC upon creation |
| **Payment terms** | Monthly invoicing based on actual costs incurred, in USD or EUR |
| **Term** | Rolling annual, with project-specific SOWs |
| **Dispute resolution** | Arbitration (Singapore International Arbitration Centre or London Court of International Arbitration) |

### Transfer Pricing Considerations

The LBC → LBS development contract must withstand TP scrutiny from Cyprus tax authorities (primary risk) and any other authority examining the structure:

- **Comparable method:** Cost-plus using captive development center benchmarks (IT outsourcing studies, Deloitte Global Outsourcing Survey, NASSCOM data)
- **Target margin for Cyprus Studio:** 8-12% on fully loaded cost (includes salaries, office, equipment, social insurance, overhead)
- **Why 8-12% (not higher):** Cyprus Studio is a captive service provider with a single client (LBC). It bears no market risk, no client acquisition risk, and no IP risk. Captive centers typically earn lower margins than independent service providers. OECD guidelines and comparable studies support 8-12% for routine development services.
- **Documentation:** Annual TP study with contemporaneous documentation (Master File + Local File)
- **Functional analysis:** Cyprus Studio performs development functions only, assumes no entrepreneurial risk. LBC performs entrepreneurial functions (client acquisition, market risk, IP ownership, strategic direction)
- **Cyprus tax impact:** Cyprus taxes Studio's profit (the 8-12% markup) at 12.5%. On a $500K cost base with 10% markup, that's $50K profit × 12.5% = ~$6,250 in Cyprus tax. This is the only tax in the entire structure.

## 7. Banking and Payment Processing

### Primary Banking

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Singapore bank (recommended)** | Strong banking jurisdiction, CI IBCs accepted by several banks, multi-currency, Wise integration | Requires in-person account opening (Singapore trip) |
| **Hong Kong bank** | Good for Asia-Pacific clients | Longer account opening process |
| **Cyprus bank (secondary)** | Close to the Studio team, easy EUR transfers to LBS | Primarily useful for EUR-denominated payments |

**Recommended approach:** Open primary account at a Singapore bank (DBS, OCBC, or digital-first bank like Aspire/Statrys). Singapore banks are accustomed to servicing IBCs from clean jurisdictions.

### OpEx Reserve Fund

The CI IBC's Singapore bank account serves as the company's operating treasury and safety net:

| Parameter | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **Minimum reserve** | **$600,000** (12 months at $50K/mo burn) |
| **Target reserve** | **$1,200,000** (24 months at $50K/mo burn) |
| **Burn rate** | $50,000/month — all team salaries, contractors, Cyprus Studio cost-plus, infrastructure |
| **Tax on retained funds** | **0%** — reserves sit in the 0% CI IBC |

All company expenses are paid from this account. Partner distributions only occur after the reserve threshold is met. During the buildup phase, bonuses are split 50/50 between the OpEx Fund and the bonus pool. Once the fund reaches $600K, full bonuses are paid and quarterly distributions begin for profit above the reserve.

See [14-LIGHT-BRANDS-AI-CORPORATE-SETUP.md](./14-LIGHT-BRANDS-AI-CORPORATE-SETUP.md) for the full treasury policy and distribution waterfall.

### Payment Processing

| Method | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Stripe (Singapore entity)** | SaaS subscriptions, recurring billing |
| **Wise Business** | International wire transfers, multi-currency receiving |
| **Direct bank transfer** | Large consulting engagements, enterprise clients |

### KYC Documentation Required

Banks will require:

- Certificate of Incorporation
- Certificate of Good Standing
- Memorandum and Articles of Association
- Register of Directors and Shareholders (certified by registered agent)
- UBO declaration (identifying S.A. → PIF → founders chain)
- PIF documentation (Certificate of Registration, Foundation Charter)
- S.A. documentation (Certificate of Incorporation, board resolution, Articles of Incorporation)
- Founder passports + proof of address
- Business plan / description of activities
- Source of funds letter

## 8. Asset Protection Features

The Cook Islands is consistently ranked as the **#1 asset protection jurisdiction globally**. Key features:

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Statute of limitations** | Creditors must bring fraudulent transfer claims within **2 years** of the transfer — not 2 years from discovery |
| **Burden of proof** | Creditor must prove fraudulent intent **beyond reasonable doubt** (criminal standard, not civil) |
| **Foreign judgments** | **Not recognized or enforceable.** Creditor must re-litigate in Cook Islands courts under Cook Islands law. |
| **Forum non conveniens** | CI courts will not decline jurisdiction in favor of foreign courts |
| **No contempt enforcement** | CI courts will not enforce foreign contempt orders compelling asset disclosure or transfer |
| **Duress defense** | If a settlor/director is compelled by a foreign court to repatriate assets, the Cook Islands trustee/director can legally refuse — the foreign order constitutes duress under CI law |

### Key Precedents

| Case | Year | Holding |
|---|---|---|
| *FTC v. Affordable Media* | 1999 | US court held trustee in contempt, but CI trustee legally refused to comply — assets protected |
| *In re Huber* | 2013 | US bankruptcy court attempted to reach CI trust assets — CI protections held |

### Why This Matters for Light Brands

- **Litigation shield:** If a disgruntled client, competitor, or government entity sues, LB's revenue and IP are in a jurisdiction where foreign judgments have no force
- **Founder protection:** The PIF → S.A. → CI IBC chain creates multiple layers of asset protection (Panama PIF privacy + S.A. corporate veil + Cook Islands enforcement immunity). Founders hold equity at the S.A. level — not directly in the CI IBC — adding another layer of separation.
- **Separation from TE operations:** Even if the TE healing center faces liability, LB assets in the CI IBC are structurally isolated
- **Cyprus Studio isolation:** Even if a Cyprus employment or regulatory claim arises against the Studio, LBC's IP and revenue are in a separate jurisdiction (Cook Islands) and entity

## 9. CRS/AEOI and International Reporting

The Cook Islands participates in the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). This means:

| Reporting Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What is reported** | Account holder identity, account balance, income (interest, dividends, gross proceeds) |
| **Reported to whom** | Cook Islands Inland Revenue → OECD exchange network → participating jurisdictions |
| **Who reports** | CI financial institutions (banks, trust companies) |
| **Impact on CI IBC** | The CI IBC's bank (Singapore or elsewhere) reports to its local authority, which exchanges with CI and the founders' resident jurisdictions |
| **Impact on founders** | Founders must report S.A. and CI IBC interests on personal tax returns (FBAR/5471 for Jason as US citizen; equivalent reporting for others in their tax residence jurisdictions) |

**This is not a problem.** CRS/AEOI ensures transparency, which actually strengthens the structure's defensibility. The 0% tax rate is a sovereign policy choice, not evasion. Full reporting compliance demonstrates the structure is not trying to hide anything.

## 10. Cost Analysis

### Formation (One-Time)

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Government registration fee | ~$300-500 |
| Registered agent setup fee | ~$1,000-1,500 |
| Legal review of Articles | ~$500-1,000 |
| Nominee director setup (if used) | ~$500-1,000 |
| Bank account opening (Singapore trip) | ~$1,500-2,500 (travel + bank fees) |
| **Total formation** | **~$3,800-6,500** |

### Annual Ongoing

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Registered agent annual fee | ~$1,500-2,500 |
| Government annual license fee | ~$300-500 |
| Nominee director fee | ~$500-1,000 |
| Bank account maintenance | ~$200-500 |
| Transfer pricing study (LBC↔LBS Cyprus) | ~$3,000-5,000 (annual update) |
| **Total annual** | **~$7,500-14,500** |

### Cost in Context

At even modest Light Brands revenue ($500K/year), the annual cost of maintaining the CI IBC (~$10K) represents a 2% overhead — while the entity generates a 0% tax rate on all international income. At $2M+ revenue, the overhead drops below 0.5%.

*This document describes the operating specifications for a Cook Islands International Business Company within the Light Brands four-entity structure (PIF → S.A. → LBC / LBS). The Cook Islands IBC regime is an explicit provision of the Cook Islands International Companies Act 1981-82. All tax treatments described are based on current Cook Islands law and international tax frameworks. Implementation requires validation by a qualified Cook Islands registered agent and coordination with Cyprus, US, and Panama counsel, as well as a transfer pricing advisor for the LBC↔LBS intercompany relationship.*
