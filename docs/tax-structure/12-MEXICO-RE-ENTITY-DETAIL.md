# TE RE Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.: Real Estate Holdings — Operating Detail

> **Status:** Entity specification — requires Mexican counsel + Cayman counsel validation
> **Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## 1. Summary

TE RE Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. is a Mexican limited liability company purpose-built for real estate acquisition, title holding, and development in Tulum, Quintana Roo. It acquires land, holds legal title to all real estate assets, develops villas, healing center facilities, and infrastructure, and leases developed property to TE Ops Mexico under an arm's length rental agreement. Owned 100% by TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — a sibling entity to TE Ops Mexico under the same parent.

The RE entity is asset-holding and development-focused — it is NOT client-facing and does NOT employ operational staff. Property management (maintenance, security, groundskeeping, renovation oversight) remains inside TE Ops Mexico, where it is operationally continuous with facility operations and guest services.

30% corporate income tax on rental income, offset by building depreciation (5% annual straight-line for commercial structures). Land is not depreciable. Capitalized via equity contribution from TE Holdings (Cayman) to avoid thin capitalization and REFIPRE complications. On disposition, the RE entity's strategy is **cost basis maximization** -- every dollar of development cost on the entity's books reduces the taxable capital gain by one dollar. At $100M in development costs, the inflation-adjusted cost basis shields the majority of any sale proceeds from Mexico's 30% ISR. Zero employees eliminates the 10% PTU on capital gains. After-tax proceeds flow to TE Holdings (Cayman) at 0%, then upstream through the PIF at 0%.

## 2. Why S. de R.L. de C.V. (Entity Type)

| Entity Type | Tax Treatment | Liability | Foreign Ownership | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S. de R.L. de C.V.** | 30% CIT, pass-through option not used | Limited liability for all partners | Permitted (Cayman holdco as sole partner) | **Selected** |
| S.A. de C.V. | 30% CIT | Limited for shareholders | Permitted | More complex governance, unnecessary for single-owner RE holding |
| Fideicomiso (bank trust) | Tax-transparent or opaque depending on structure | Trust structure | Required for residential RE in restricted zone | May be required for residential villas — see Section 6 |
| Branch office | 30% CIT + remittance tax risk | Unlimited — parent liable | Permitted | No liability separation, parent exposed |

**S. de R.L. de C.V. wins for the same reasons as TE Ops Mexico:**

1. **Limited liability** — protects TE Holdings from claims against the RE entity's assets (construction disputes, environmental liability, title defects)
2. **Simple governance** — single member (TE Holdings), no board of directors required, managed by an administrator
3. **Consistency** — same entity type as TE Ops Mexico, simplifying Mexican counsel engagement and compliance
4. **Foreign ownership permitted** — Cayman company can be the sole socio (partner), subject to restricted zone rules (see Section 6)

## 3. Formation and Governance

### Formation Requirements

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Governing law** | Ley General de Sociedades Mercantiles (General Law of Commercial Companies) |

| **Bank account** | Required — Mexican bank, separate from TE Ops Mexico |
| **Administrator** | Appointed by TE Holdings (sole socio). Can be same person as TE Ops Mexico administrator. |
| **Socios (partners)** | TE Holdings (Cayman) as sole socio. Mexican law requires minimum 2 socios for S. de R.L. — typically solved with TE Holdings holding 99% and a nominee or second entity holding 1%. |
| **Capital** | Variable capital structure (de C.V.) — allows flexible equity contributions from Holdings |
| **Formation time** | 4-8 weeks (notary, RFC registration, bank account) |

### Governance

| Role | Person/Entity | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Sole socio (99%)** | TE Holdings (Cayman) | Parent company controls all RE decisions |
| **Minority socio (1%)** | Nominee or second entity | Mexican law minimum requirement |

## 4. Tax Treatment

### Corporate Income Tax

| Item | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Corporate tax rate** | 30% CIT on net taxable income |
| **Rental income** | Taxable — from intercompany lease to TE Ops Mexico |
| **Building depreciation** | 5% annual straight-line (commercial buildings under LISR Art. 34) |
| **Land** | NOT depreciable — cost recoverable only on disposition |
| **Development costs** | Capitalized, depreciated once the asset is placed in service |
| **Pre-operating expenses** | 10% annual straight-line amortization (LISR Art. 33) |
| **Interest expense** | Deductible subject to thin capitalization rules (3:1 debt-to-equity for related-party debt) |
| **IVA on intercompany rent** | 16% IVA applies; TE Ops Mexico claims input credit |

### Depreciation — The Key Tax Shield

Building depreciation is the primary tax advantage of separating RE from operations:

| Asset | Depreciation Rate | Example: $5M Building |
|---|---|---|
| Commercial buildings | 5% annual straight-line | $250,000/year deduction |
| Hotel buildings | 5% annual straight-line | $250,000/year deduction |
| Furniture and fixtures | 10% annual straight-line | — |
| Machinery and equipment | 10% annual straight-line | — |
| Computers and technology | 30% annual straight-line | — |

**Impact:** If the RE entity earns $500K/year in rental income and has $5M in depreciable buildings, the $250K depreciation deduction reduces taxable income to $250K. Tax = $75K instead of $150K — a 50% reduction in Mexico-level RE tax.

### Dividend Distribution

| Scenario | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Dividends from CUFIN** | 0% additional tax — distributed from after-tax profits account |
| **Dividends from non-CUFIN** | 10% additional tax on gross-up amount |
| **Dividends to Holdings (Cayman)** | No Cayman tax on receipt (0% unconditional) |

**CUFIN (Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta):** Mexico maintains a tracked account of after-tax profits. Dividends paid from the CUFIN balance incur no additional tax. Dividends exceeding the CUFIN balance trigger a 10% pilon (additional tax). Proper CUFIN management is essential for tax-efficient profit extraction.

### Withholding Tax on Outbound Payments

| Payment Type | WHT Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Dividends to TE Holdings (Cayman)** | 0% from CUFIN / 10% from non-CUFIN | No Mexico-Cayman tax treaty |
| **Management fees to Holdings** | 25% WHT (LISR Art. 167) | Avoid — use equity capitalization instead |
| **Interest to Holdings** | 4.9-35% depending on terms | Avoid — use equity capitalization instead |

**Recommendation:** Avoid outbound payments other than dividends from CUFIN. Equity capitalization eliminates interest payments, management fees, and associated WHT/REFIPRE complications.

## 5. Why Two Mexican Entities (Not Three)

The five-dimension analysis clearly favors two entities (RE + OpCo) over three (RE + Management + OpCo):

### 1. Tax Efficiency

All Mexican entities pay 30% CIT. A third management entity earns thin cost-plus margins, paying 30% on a sliver. No meaningful tax savings. Two entities already achieve the key tax benefit: depreciation on buildings shelters rental income in the RE entity.

### 2. Risk Isolation

The critical separation is **assets vs. operations**. Guest liability, employment claims, and program risk stay in OpCo. Land and developed property sit in the RE entity, unreachable by OpCo creditors. A third management entity adds minimal incremental protection — management liability (contractor disputes, maintenance claims) is low-severity and doesn't threaten the core real estate assets.

### 3. Transfer Pricing

Two entities = one intercompany lease (RE to OpCo). Three entities = two additional intercompany arrangements (RE to Management, Management to OpCo), each requiring TP documentation, benchmarking studies, and annual updates. More surface area for SAT audit, more compliance cost, zero structural benefit.

### 4. Regulatory Exposure

Each Mexican entity requires its own RFC, bank account, annual tax filings, informativa returns, and TP documentation. Three entities = 3x the compliance burden. Management is operationally continuous with facility operations — separating it creates administrative overhead with no regulatory upside.

### 5. Exit Flexibility

Two entities achieve the key exit optionality: sell the RE entity (assets) without disrupting operations, or sell OpCo (brand, team, guest relationships) without selling the land. Management is rarely sold independently — it's naturally part of either the asset holder or the operator.

### Why Management Belongs in OpCo

- OpCo already employs the local staff who maintain the facility (maintenance, kitchen, medical)
- Property management tasks (cleaning, groundskeeping, security, renovation oversight) are operationally continuous with guest services
- The people managing the property ARE the people running the operations
- No new entity formation, no new intercompany agreements, no new TP studies
- OpCo's cost base (which flows into the cost-plus calculation to Holdings) naturally absorbs property management costs

## 6. Restricted Zone Analysis (CRITICAL — Requires Mexican Counsel)

### The Restricted Zone

Tulum is in Mexico's **restricted zone** — within 50 km of the Caribbean coast and 100 km of international borders. Under the Ley de Inversion Extranjera (Foreign Investment Law):

| Rule | Application |
|---|---|
| **Direct foreign ownership of residential RE** | PROHIBITED in restricted zone |
| **Mexican company with foreign shareholders — commercial use** | PERMITTED under Article 10-A |
| **Mexican company with foreign shareholders — residential use** | Requires fideicomiso (bank trust) |
| **Fideicomiso** | 50-year renewable bank trust; Mexican bank holds legal title as trustee |

### The Critical Classification Question

The classification of **villas** determines the legal structure:

| Villa Use | Classification | Title Holding Method |
|---|---|---|
| Part of commercial hospitality operation (guest accommodation) | Commercial | RE entity holds title directly |
| Personal residences for sale to individuals | Residential | Fideicomiso required |
| Mixed use (hospitality + occasional residential sales) | Unclear | Counsel must determine |

**If villas are part of the healing center's commercial hospitality operation** (guests stay in villas during programs, villas are not sold individually, no residential units offered for personal use), the RE entity can likely hold title directly under Article 10-A. This is how hotel chains (Marriott, Hyatt, Banyan Tree) hold beachfront property in the restricted zone through Mexican subsidiaries.

**If any villas are sold or used residentially**, a fideicomiso may be required even for the Mexican company with foreign ownership.

### Fideicomiso Structure (If Required)

```
TE Holdings (Cayman)
  └── 100% TE RE Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.
        └── Beneficiary of Fideicomiso
              └── Mexican Bank (trustee) holds legal title to restricted zone land
```

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Trustee** | Mexican bank (Banamex, BBVA, Santander, Banorte) |
| **Beneficiary** | TE RE Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. |
| **Term** | 50 years, renewable |
| **Annual cost** | ~$1,000-3,000 USD (trustee fee) |
| **Permit** | SRE (Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores) permit required |
| **Tax treatment** | RE entity as beneficiary — rental income and depreciation flow through to the entity |

**This must be resolved with Mexican counsel before entity formation.**

---

## 7. Capitalization Strategy

### Equity Funding (Recommended)

TE Holdings contributes capital to TE RE Mexico for land acquisition and development. This is the recommended approach over intercompany loans.

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|
| **Equity contribution** (recommended) | No interest payments → no REFIPRE risk. No thin capitalization issues. Clean dividend extraction via CUFIN. | Capital locked in entity until distributed as dividends. |
| **Intercompany loan** | Interest deductible for RE entity. | Interest payments to Cayman could trigger REFIPRE (Cayman <22.5% effective rate). Subject to thin capitalization (3:1 debt-to-equity). Interest WHT applies. |
| **Hybrid** | Partial deductibility. | Complexity. TP on interest rate. SAT scrutiny on related-party debt. |

### Why Equity Is Optimal

1. **Avoids REFIPRE** — Interest payments from Mexico to Cayman could trigger REFIPRE rules (outbound payment to a jurisdiction with <22.5% effective rate). Equity contributions avoid this entirely.
2. **Avoids thin capitalization** — Mexico's LISR limits deductible related-party interest to a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio. Equity has no such limitation.
3. **Clean profit extraction** — After-tax profits accumulate in CUFIN. Dividends from CUFIN to Holdings incur 0% additional tax. Holdings receives at 0% (Cayman).
4. **Simpler compliance** — No interest rate benchmarking, no thin cap calculations, no REFIPRE analysis on interest flows.

### Capital Requirements (Estimated)

Development costs could scale to **$100M+** depending on the scope of land development, villa construction, healing center buildout, infrastructure, and amenity investment. Every dollar of legitimate development cost capitalized on the RE entity's books becomes cost basis that shields the eventual capital gain on disposition.

| Phase | Conservative | Full-Scale | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Land acquisition** | $1-5M | $5-15M | Raw land in Tulum corridor |
| **Phase 1 development** | $3-8M | $15-30M | Healing center facility, initial villas, infrastructure |
| **Phase 2 development** | $5-15M | $25-40M | Additional villas, amenities, expansion |
| **Phase 3 development** | — | $15-25M | Full buildout, luxury amenities, infrastructure |
| **Working capital** | $200-500K | $1-3M | Pre-operating costs, permits, professional fees |
| **Total estimated** | **$9-28M** | **$61-113M** | Over 3-7 year development period |

**At $100M scale, the capitalization strategy becomes the most consequential tax decision in the entire structure.** Every dollar of development cost on the RE entity's books is a dollar of cost basis that reduces the taxable gain on any future property sale. See Section 14 (Disposition and Sale Strategy) for the full analysis.

## 8. Intercompany Lease Structure

### Lease Agreement: TE RE Mexico → TE Ops Mexico

| Term | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Lessor** | TE RE Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (RE entity) |
| **Lessee** | TE Ops Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (OpCo) |
| **Property** | All developed real estate — healing center facility, villas, infrastructure |
| **Rental rate** | Arm's length market rent (TP study required) |
| **IVA** | 16% IVA charged on rent; OpCo claims input credit |
| **Term** | Multi-year with annual CPI adjustment |
| **Maintenance** | OpCo responsible for day-to-day maintenance (property management inside OpCo) |
| **Capital improvements** | RE entity responsible for capital improvements and major renovations |

### Transfer Pricing for Intercompany Rent

| Method | Application |
|---|---|
| **Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP)** | Primary method — compare to arm's length rental rates for similar commercial properties in Tulum/Riviera Maya |
| **Comparable benchmarks** | Hotel/resort property rental rates in Quintana Roo |
| **Annual update** | TP study updated annually with current market data |
| **SAT documentation** | Informativa de Operaciones con Partes Relacionadas (related-party transaction disclosure) |

### Money Flow

```
TE Holdings (Cayman)
  │
  ├── Equity contribution → TE RE Mexico (capital for land + development)
  │
  └── Service fee (cost + 8-12%) → TE Ops Mexico (existing)

TE RE Mexico → Leases property to TE Ops Mexico (arm's length rent)
TE Ops Mexico → Pays rent to TE RE Mexico (deductible operating cost)
TE Ops Mexico's rent → Becomes part of OpCo cost base → Passed to Holdings in cost-plus calculation
TE RE Mexico → Dividends to TE Holdings (from CUFIN at 0% additional tax)
```

**Key flow:** OpCo's rent payments to the RE entity become part of OpCo's cost base, passed up to Holdings in the cost-plus calculation. Holdings bears the economic cost. RE entity earns rental income offset by depreciation — reducing total Mexico-level tax vs. a pure service fee model.

## 13. Advantages for All Parties

### For Investors

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **RE asset exposure** | Investor (via Holdings) has economic exposure to Tulum real estate — land appreciation, development value, rental yield |
| **Risk isolation** | RE assets separated from operational liability. A guest injury claim against OpCo cannot reach the land and buildings. |
| **Depreciation benefits** | Building depreciation reduces Mexico-level tax, increasing after-tax returns to Holdings |
| **Exit optionality** | Can sell RE entity separately (asset deal) or include in Holdings share sale (equity deal) |

### For Founders

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Asset protection** | Real estate in a separate entity, under Holdings (Cayman), under S.A. (Panama), under PIF. Multiple layers between personal liability and physical assets. |
| **Development flexibility** | RE entity can acquire, develop, and hold property independently of operations |
| **Clean expansion** | Additional properties → additional acquisitions in same RE entity, or new RE entities if needed |

### For Tax Defense

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Depreciation shield** | 5% annual building depreciation offsets rental income — reduces effective Mexico tax on RE income |
| **Arm's length lease** | Standard intercompany arrangement, benchmarked against Tulum commercial rental market |
| **Equity capitalization** | No REFIPRE risk from interest payments. No thin cap complications. Clean structure. |
| **CUFIN extraction** | Dividends from after-tax profits to Holdings at 0% additional Mexican tax, 0% Cayman receipt |

### For Operations

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **OpCo stays lean** | OpCo's cost base includes rent (deductible), not massive capital expenditure for land and buildings |
| **Management continuity** | Property management stays in OpCo — same staff, same operations, no new entity overhead |
| **Lease flexibility** | Rent can be adjusted at arm's length as property portfolio grows |

---

## 14. Disposition and Sale Strategy (Capital Gains)

This is the most tax-consequential section. The entire development cost strategy is designed to maximize the RE entity's cost basis so that when property is eventually sold, the taxable gain is minimized.

### The Core Principle: Fatten the Basis, Slim the Gain

Unlike the OpCo (where the goal is to keep Mexican revenue thin), the RE entity strategy is the **opposite** -- maximize every legitimate cost on the Mexican entity's books. Every dollar of cost basis reduces the taxable capital gain on sale by one dollar, saving 30 cents in ISR.

### Capital Gains Tax on Real Estate Sale

| Element | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Tax rate** | 30% ISR on net gain (corporate rate) |
| **Taxable gain** | Sale price minus adjusted cost basis (costo fiscal ajustado) |
| **Cost basis includes** | Land acquisition + all capitalized development costs + capitalized soft costs + capitalized interest during construction |
| **Basis adjustments** | Reduced by cumulative depreciation claimed; increased by actualizacion (inflation adjustment) |
| **Provisional withholding** | Notary withholds provisional ISR at closing (~20% of gross, credited against final ISR) |
| **PTU** | 10% of the Mexican entity's annual profits (including capital gains) must be distributed to employees |
| **IVA** | 16% on commercial real estate sales (not on residential); may apply depending on property classification |

### Actualizacion: The Inflation Adjustment Shield

Mexico allows **actualizacion** -- inflation adjustment of the cost basis using the INPC (Indice Nacional de Precios al Consumidor). This is a significant and often overlooked benefit.

| Year of Sale | Original Basis | Estimated Inflation-Adjusted Basis | Additional Shield |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 3 | $100M | ~$112M | ~$12M |
| Year 5 | $100M | ~$122M | ~$22M |
| Year 7 | $100M | ~$131M | ~$31M |
| Year 10 | $100M | ~$148M | ~$48M |

*Assumes ~4% average annual INPC inflation. Actual adjustment calculated month-by-month using published INPC values.*

At 30% ISR, a Year 7 inflation adjustment of $31M saves **~$9.3M in capital gains tax** on a cost that was never actually incurred -- it is purely a function of holding the asset.

### Cost Basis Maximization: What Can Be Capitalized

Every item below goes on the RE entity's books and increases the cost basis:

**Hard construction costs**
- Labor, materials, MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing)
- Site preparation, grading, earthwork
- Infrastructure (roads, utilities, drainage, water systems)
- Landscaping and site work

**Soft costs (often missed but fully capitalizable)**
- Architectural and engineering fees (including fees paid to Studio in Dubai -- the RE entity pays for the service, so the cost is on the RE entity's books)
- Legal fees related to development
- Permit and licensing costs
- Environmental compliance and impact assessments
- Insurance during construction period
- Project management fees (including fees paid to TE Holdings for development oversight)
- Security during construction
- Surveying and geotechnical studies

**Capitalized interest**
- Interest on construction financing during the construction period (if any debt is used)
- Capitalizable under LISR rules until the asset is placed in service

**Pre-operating expenses**
- Amortized at 10% annual straight-line (LISR Art. 33)
- Included in deductible base during operations AND adds to the cost basis analysis on sale

**Furniture, fixtures, and equipment**
- Depreciated at applicable rates during operations
- Remaining book value included in basis on sale

**Technology and systems**
- Imported equipment procured through TE Holdings -- the RE entity pays for it, cost is on Mexican books
- Installation costs capitalized

### Intercompany Development Services: Cost Stays in Mexico, Margin Stays Offshore

During the development phase, Studio (Dubai) and TE Holdings (Cayman) provide genuine services to the RE entity:

| Service Provider | Service | Pricing | Where the Cost Lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Studio (Dubai, 0%)** | Architectural design, technology systems, AI integration, interior design | Cost + 8-12% | RE entity pays the full invoice --> cost on Mexican books. Studio keeps its margin at 0%. |
| **TE Holdings (Cayman, 0%)** | Development project management, procurement, quality oversight | Cost + 8-12% | RE entity pays the full invoice --> cost on Mexican books. Holdings keeps its margin at 0%. |
| **Third-party contractors** | Construction, MEP, infrastructure | Market rate | RE entity pays directly --> cost on Mexican books |

**The key insight:** The RE entity is the *payer* for all development services. The full cost (including the offshore entities' markups) sits on the RE entity's books as capitalizable development costs, increasing the cost basis. Meanwhile, the profit margins on those services sit in 0% entities. **Both sides win** -- Mexico gets a large cost basis (reducing future capital gains tax), and the service providers earn at 0%.

### The Depreciation Trade-Off

During operations (before sale), building depreciation reduces annual taxable income but also reduces cost basis:

| Holding Period | Cumulative Depreciation (5%/yr on improvements) | Basis Reduction | Net Effect After Actualizacion |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 years | 25% of improvements | -$25M on $100M | Partially offset by ~$22M actualizacion |
| 10 years | 50% of improvements | -$50M on $100M | Partially offset by ~$48M actualizacion |
| 15 years | 75% of improvements | -$75M on $100M | Partially offset by ~$80M actualizacion |

**After ~13-14 years, the actualizacion overtakes the cumulative depreciation**, meaning the inflation-adjusted basis exceeds the original cost even after depreciation. This is a long-term structural advantage of holding Mexican real estate.

### PTU: The Hidden Tax on Real Estate Gains

Mexico's Participacion de los Trabajadores en las Utilidades (PTU) requires employers to distribute **10% of taxable profits** to employees. This applies to capital gains realized by the RE entity.

| Scenario | Capital Gain | PTU Obligation (10%) | ISR (30%) | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $50M gain | $50M | $5M | $15M | $20M (40% effective) |
| $30M gain | $30M | $3M | $9M | $12M (40% effective) |
| $10M gain | $10M | $1M | $3M | $4M (40% effective) |

**Mitigation:** The RE entity has no employees (as designed in Section 10). An entity with zero employees has no PTU obligation. The administrator is appointed by Holdings, not employed by the RE entity. **This zero-employee design is critical** -- it eliminates the 10% PTU on capital gains entirely.

**Counsel must confirm:** Whether a Mexican entity with zero employees and an appointed administrator is truly exempt from PTU on capital gains. Some interpretations require PTU distribution to the administrator. This is a question for Mexican labor/tax counsel.

### Disposition Options: Asset Sale vs. Share Sale

| Option | Mechanism | Mexico Tax | Cayman Tax | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Asset sale** | RE entity sells the property to buyer | 30% ISR on gain (offset by cost basis + actualizacion) | 0% on dividends received | Clean, standard, defensible | Gain taxed in Mexico; IVA may apply |
| **B. Share sale (indirect transfer)** | TE Holdings (Cayman) sells its shares in the RE entity to buyer | Mexico claims taxing rights on "indirect transfers" of Mexican RE under LISR Art. 161 | 0% (Cayman) | Transaction occurs at Cayman level | Mexico anti-avoidance rules on indirect transfers; enforcement risk; buyer may prefer asset deal |
| **C. Beneficiary substitution (fideicomiso)** | Transfer the fideicomiso beneficial interest | ISAI (acquisition tax, 2-4%) paid by new beneficiary; ISR on gain for transferor | 0% | Avoids full property transfer mechanics | Only works if fideicomiso is in place |

**Recommendation:** Option A (asset sale) is the most defensible and standard approach. Option B (share sale) should be explored with counsel as a potentially lower-tax alternative, but Mexico's anti-avoidance rules on indirect real estate transfers are increasingly aggressive.

### Repatriation After Sale

| Flow | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Return of invested capital** to TE Holdings | NOT a dividend -- no 10% WHT. This is the return of the equity contribution. Up to the amount of the original capitalization ($100M), funds flow back as capital return. |
| **Profit distribution** (gain above capital) to TE Holdings | Dividend from CUFIN: 0% additional tax. Dividend from non-CUFIN: 10% additional tax (pilon). |
| **TE Holdings receives funds** | 0% (Cayman, unconditional) |
| **Holdings --> S.A. --> PIF --> founders** | 0% at every layer |

**Critical:** Proper documentation of the equity contribution amount is essential. SAT will verify that the "return of capital" does not exceed the original contributed capital. Maintain meticulous records of every equity injection from TE Holdings to the RE entity.

### Example: $100M Development, $150M Sale

| Line Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| **Sale price** | $150,000,000 |
| Land acquisition cost | ($10,000,000) |
| Construction and development | ($85,000,000) |
| Soft costs (design, permits, legal, tech) | ($5,000,000) |
| **Original cost basis** | **$100,000,000** |
| Cumulative depreciation (5 years at 5%) | +$21,250,000 (reduces basis) |
| Actualizacion (inflation adjustment, 5 years) | -$22,000,000 (increases basis) |
| **Adjusted cost basis** | **~$100,750,000** |
| **Taxable gain** | **~$49,250,000** |
| ISR at 30% | ~$14,775,000 |
| PTU (0% -- zero employees) | $0 |
| **Total Mexican tax on sale** | **~$14,775,000** |
| **Effective rate on gross sale** | **~9.9%** |
| **Net proceeds to TE Holdings** | **~$135,225,000** |
| Tax on proceeds in Cayman | $0 |
| Tax at S.A./PIF level | $0 |

Without the cost basis strategy (if costs were routed offshore and only $20M sat on Mexican books):
- Taxable gain: ~$130M
- ISR: ~$39M
- **Cost basis maximization saved ~$24.2M in Mexican tax.**

## 15. Intercompany Development Services During Construction

During the development phase, the RE entity engages offshore entities for genuine services. This section details how those services are structured to maximize cost basis in Mexico while keeping service margins in 0% entities.

### Service Agreements During Development

| Agreement | Provider | Client | Scope | Pricing | TP Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Development Management Agreement** | TE Holdings (Cayman) | TE RE Mexico | Project oversight, procurement, quality control, budget management | Cost + 8-12% | TNMM or CUP |
| **Design and Technology Services** | Studio (Dubai) | TE RE Mexico | Architectural design, technology integration, AI systems, interior design | Cost + 8-12% | TNMM or CUP |
| **Equipment Procurement** | TE Holdings (Cayman) | TE RE Mexico | International equipment sourcing, negotiation, logistics | Cost + markup (arm's length) | CUP |

### How It Works

```
Studio (Dubai, 0%) provides design services worth $8M
  ├── Studio's cost: $7M (salaries, overhead)
  ├── Studio's margin: $1M (at 0% tax)
  └── RE entity pays $8M --> capitalized on Mexican books as development cost

TE Holdings (Cayman, 0%) provides management services worth $5M
  ├── Holdings' cost: $4.5M (oversight, procurement)
  ├── Holdings' margin: $500K (at 0% tax)
  └── RE entity pays $5M --> capitalized on Mexican books as development cost

Total cost on RE entity's books: $13M
Total margin in 0% entities: $1.5M
Cost basis increase for RE entity: $13M (reduces future capital gains by $13M)
```

### Transfer Pricing Documentation

All intercompany development services require TP documentation:

- Annual benchmarking studies for cost-plus margins
- Detailed SOWs (Statements of Work) for each development phase
- Time records and resource allocation documentation
- Comparable data from international development management and design firms
- Filed with SAT as part of the Informativa de Operaciones con Partes Relacionadas

*This document describes the operating specifications for a Mexican real estate holding entity within the TE Wellness / Light Brands unified structure. The Mexican corporate tax treatment, depreciation rates, restricted zone rules, and CUFIN dividend mechanics are based on the Ley del Impuesto Sobre la Renta (LISR) and the Ley de Inversion Extranjera. All tax treatments described are based on current Mexican law. Implementation requires validation by qualified Mexican real estate counsel, Mexican tax counsel, and coordination with Cayman counsel for the capitalization structure.*
