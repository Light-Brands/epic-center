## How to Use This Document

Bring the relevant section to each counsel meeting. Questions are organized by jurisdiction and prioritized:

- **CRITICAL** — Must resolve before spending money on entity formation. Answer determines structure.
- **IMPORTANT** — Must resolve during formation. Answer affects implementation details.
- **FORWARD** — Resolve when operationally relevant. No urgency.

---

## 1. UAE Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** First meeting. This is the gating engagement — do not spend money on entity formation until Q1 is resolved.

### Q1: QFZP Viability for Natural Persons Revenue
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** UAE QFZP rules exclude "transactions with natural persons" from qualifying income. TE's guests are natural persons. If revenue doesn't qualify for 0%, the entire UAE structure shifts to 9% CT.
**Question:** Does revenue from individual guests paying for access to a copyrighted AI software platform qualify as income from Qualifying Intellectual Property under QFZP rules?
**What depends on the answer:** If yes, proceed with UAE structure. If no, evaluate 9% rate (still favorable) or pivot to Singapore Pioneer Certificate.

### Q2: B2B Alternative Structure
**Priority:** CRITICAL (if Q1 is negative)
**Context:** If direct B2C revenue doesn't qualify, a B2B intermediary (corporate booking entity) might.
**Question:** If Q1 is negative, is there a structural alternative (e.g., B2B booking entity, platform access agreement) that would qualify the revenue?

### Q3: Panama PIF as Sole Shareholder
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The PIF will be the 100% shareholder of the DIC FZ-LLC. Some free zones have restrictions on foreign foundation ownership.
**Question:** Can a Panama PIF serve as sole shareholder of a DIC FZ-LLC without triggering adverse QFZP or substance implications?

### Q4: Content License from US Church
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The church pays the UAE entity an arm's-length license fee for content. This fee flows from a US entity to a UAE entity.
**Question:** Is a content license fee from a US 508(c)(1)(A) church to the UAE entity treated as qualifying income under QFZP?

### Q5: Minimum Substance Threshold
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The UAE entity will earn $10-35M/year. Substance must be proportional.
**Question:** What is the minimum substance threshold for a technology company earning $10-35M/year in DIC? Is 5-6 employees sufficient, or does the FTA expect more?

### Q47: Intercompany Pricing for UAE ↔ CI IBC Subcontracting
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The UAE entity will provide development services to the CI IBC under a subcontracting arrangement. The CI IBC pays cost-plus to the UAE entity. Both entities are at 0%, so there is no tax arbitrage — but the arrangement must still be arm's length for TP purposes.
**Question:** What is the FTA's view on intercompany subcontracting arrangements where a UAE FZ entity provides services to a Cook Islands IBC (both at 0%)? Does the UAE FTA require TP documentation for related-party transactions where both parties are at 0%? What margin range is defensible?

## 2. US Religious Nonprofit Attorney

**Engagement:** Parallel with UAE counsel. Validates the church structure.

### Q6: 508(c)(1)(A) Eligibility with Content Licensing Model
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** The church licenses content from the UAE entity and distributes it to followers. Revenue comes from content sales, donations, and speaking fees — not program fees (those go to the UAE entity).
**Question:** Does this content licensing + distribution model maintain 508(c)(1)(A) eligibility? Are there any structural features that could jeopardize church status?

### Q7: State of Incorporation
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The church needs a US state for incorporation. Different states have different nonprofit laws, property tax treatment, and regulatory environments.
**Question:** What is the optimal state of incorporation for the Church of the Living Light? Factors: property tax exemption on parsonage, favorable nonprofit law, minimal regulatory burden, no state income tax on exempt entities.

### Q8: Dual Housing Allowances
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Both the US founder and Canadian founder are ordained ministers. Both could receive housing allowances.
**Question:** Can both founders receive housing allowances simultaneously from the same church? Any limitations on dual designations?

### Q9: Content License Agreement Language
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The arm's-length content license between the UAE entity and the church is critical for IP ownership (DEMPE) and church independence.
**Question:** What required language should the content license agreement contain to preserve both the church's exempt status and the UAE entity's IP ownership?

### Q45: Dual Royalty Streams to Church (UAE Content + CI IBC Spiritual Tech)
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The church will now receive two royalty streams: (1) content license from UAE entity (TE spiritual content), and (2) spiritual technology license from CI IBC (Light Brands tools/platforms). Both should be UBIT-exempt under IRC 512(b)(2) as royalty income.
**Question:** Does receiving royalties from two separate foreign entities (one in UAE, one in Cook Islands) raise any additional UBIT, unrelated business income, or church status concerns? Any special documentation needed for the dual-stream structure?

---

## 3. US International Tax Attorney

**Engagement:** Parallel with above. Confirms the US founder's personal tax position.

### Q10: No-Ownership CFC Elimination
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** The US founder is an employee of the UAE entity but is NOT a beneficiary of the PIF that owns it. This should eliminate all CFC/GILTI exposure.
**Question:** Confirm that no-ownership (employee-only, not PIF beneficiary, no signatory authority, no control rights) eliminates all CFC/GILTI/Subpart F exposure for the US founder. Are there any constructive ownership or attribution rules that could reach through the PIF?

### Q11: Dual Employment Tax Traps
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The US founder receives salary from both a UAE entity and a US church simultaneously.
**Question:** Are there any dual-employment tax traps? Can FEIE apply to the UAE salary while the church salary is taxed normally? Any SE tax complications from the dual arrangement?

### Q12: Housing Allowance for Overseas Minister
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The US founder lives in Dubai but is an ordained minister of a US church.
**Question:** Does IRC 107 housing allowance apply even if the minister lives outside the US? Can the Dubai residence qualify?

### Q13: FEIE + Housing Allowance Stacking
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The US founder claims FEIE on UAE salary and housing allowance on church compensation. These are different income sources.
**Question:** Can FEIE and housing allowance stack (since they apply to different income sources)? Any interaction effects?

### Q14: Form 4361 Eligibility
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Ministers can opt out of SE tax via Form 4361, saving 15.3% on both salary and housing allowance.
**Question:** Can the US founder qualify for Form 4361 (SE tax opt-out) as an ordained minister? What are the requirements and what is forfeited (Social Security, Medicare)?

### Q15: Section 962 as Fallback
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** If the no-ownership structure is ever reconsidered and the US founder takes an equity stake, Section 962 election would cap GILTI at corporate rates (~10.5%).
**Question:** Model the effective tax rate under employee-only ($130K+ salary) vs. CFC ownership with Section 962 election, given projected TE income of $4-21M EBITDA over Years 1-5.

### Q44: PIF Look-Through Risk for CI IBC (US Founder)
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The PIF now owns two foreign entities (UAE FZ-LLC + Cook Islands IBC). The US founder is excluded as PIF beneficiary, which eliminates CFC/GILTI for the UAE entity.
**Question:** Confirm that the same no-ownership CFC elimination analysis applies to the CI IBC. Are there any differences in how the IRS might treat a Cook Islands entity vs. a UAE entity when analyzing constructive ownership through a Panama PIF?

## 4. Canadian Emigration Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** IMMEDIATELY. This is time-sensitive — must complete before the seed round closes.

### Q16: Departure Tax Timing
**Priority:** CRITICAL — TIME-SENSITIVE
**Context:** Departure tax is based on FMV at departure date. Pre-revenue, pre-raise = minimal FMV. After the seed round ($29.35M post-money), the bill becomes significant. Every month of delay increases the liability.
**Question:** Can the founder complete departure (sever ties, establish UAE residency, file NR73) BEFORE the seed round closes? What is the defensible FMV of the founder's equity at pre-revenue stage?

### Q17: NR73 Filing Strategy
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** NR73 is optional but provides written CRA confirmation of non-resident status.
**Question:** Should the founder file NR73 proactively (for certainty) or wait for a CRA inquiry (to avoid drawing attention)?

### Q18: PIF Look-Through Risk
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** After departure, the founder is PIF Protector and beneficiary. CRA could potentially argue the PIF is a conduit.
**Question:** Under which circumstances (if any) could the CRA look through the Panama PIF and attribute income to the founder post-departure? What protections are needed? Does departure eliminate all CFC/FAPI exposure?

### Q19: Departure Tax Security
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Departure tax can be deferred with security posted.
**Question:** If any departure tax is owed, what forms of security does the CRA accept? Can deferral reduce the immediate cash impact?

## 5. Panama Counsel

**Engagement:** Weeks 2-4. Entity formation.

### Q20: PIF Structuring for Mixed Founders
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Canadian founder is Protector and beneficiary. US founder must be explicitly excluded to avoid CFC. Cyprus founder may be added as beneficiary (5% SDC on distributions).
**Question:** Optimal PIF structuring: single PIF with careful beneficiary designations, or separate PIFs? Can the US founder serve on the Foundation Council without triggering grantor trust status?

### Q21: Foundation Council Independence
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The PIF must be an independent legal person — not a sham or alter ego of the founders.
**Question:** What degree of founder involvement in the Foundation Council is acceptable without the PIF being recharacterized? Should all three Council members be independent?

### Q22: Banking and KYC
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The PIF needs a bank account (Panama or Singapore) and must provide KYC documents for the UAE entity's bank and the CI IBC's bank.
**Question:** What apostilled documents will be needed for UAE and Singapore bank KYC? Which banks are experienced with PIF-owned holding structures?

### Q46: PIF Owning Two Operating Entities (UAE + CI IBC)
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The same PIF will own 100% of both the UAE FZ-LLC and the Cook Islands IBC. This simplifies governance but means one PIF holds two operating entities in different jurisdictions.
**Question:** Are there any structural or governance considerations for a single PIF owning entities in both UAE and Cook Islands? Does the Foundation Charter need specific provisions for multi-entity ownership? Any conflict-of-interest issues when the two entities transact with each other (subcontracting)?

---

## 6. Mexican Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** Months 3-5. Before Mexico OpCo formation.

### Q23: REFIPRE Classification
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The Platform-as-Principal model means revenue flows INTO the UAE entity from guests, and service fees flow DOWN to Mexico. There are no upward payments from Mexico to zero-tax jurisdictions. But SAT may still scrutinize the structure.
**Question:** Confirm that the Platform-as-Principal model (UAE entity collects revenue, pays service fee to Mexico OpCo) does NOT trigger REFIPRE. Does SAT classify this based on the direction of payment or the overall structure?

### Q24: Transfer Pricing on Service Fee
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Mexico OpCo receives cost + 8-12% margin from the UAE entity.
**Question:** Is 8-12% a defensible arm's-length margin for a service delivery arrangement? What comparable data should the TP study include?

### Q25: PE Risk from Founder Travel
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Founders may visit the Tulum facility regularly for oversight, ceremonies, and program development.
**Question:** How many days can founders spend at the Tulum facility before creating a PE risk for the UAE entity? What activities are safe vs. risky?

### Q26: Treaty WHT on Service Fees
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Mexico-UAE have no bilateral tax treaty. Service fees from UAE to Mexico could face WHT questions.
**Question:** What is the WHT treatment of inbound service fees from a UAE entity to a Mexican OpCo? Any issues with the lack of a Mexico-UAE treaty?

---

## 7. Cook Islands Counsel

**Engagement:** Weeks 1-2. In parallel with UAE counsel. Validates CI IBC structure and banking path.

### Q37: CI IBC Formation — Optimal Registered Agent
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Light Brands Consulting Ltd will be incorporated as a Cook Islands IBC. The registered agent handles formation, annual filings, and serves as the registered office.
**Question:** Which Cook Islands registered agents / trustee companies have the best track record for IBCs owned by Panama PIFs? Any agents to avoid (compliance issues, slow service)?

### Q38: Director Structure — Nominee vs. Founder
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The CI IBC needs at least 1 director. Fewer than 3 CI-resident directors to avoid domestic tax. Options: nominee director only, or nominee + Canadian founder.
**Question:** What is the optimal director structure? Should we use a corporate nominee director (for signing routine documents) plus the Canadian founder as strategic director? Or nominee only with board resolutions?

### Q39: IBC → UAE Subcontracting — Arm's Length Pricing
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The CI IBC will subcontract all development to the UAE entity (cost-plus pricing). The CI IBC owns the LB IP; the UAE entity builds under contract.
**Question:** What is the defensible arm's length pricing methodology for the CI IBC → UAE development subcontract? Cost-plus at what margin range? What comparables should the TP study reference?

### Q40: IBC → Church Royalty Rate
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The CI IBC will license "spiritual technology" (consciousness tools, platforms) to the Church of the Living Light. The royalty must be arm's length and qualify as UBIT-exempt royalty income for the church under IRC 512(b)(2).
**Question:** What is a defensible royalty rate for spiritual technology / software licensing to a nonprofit? What TP methodology applies? Any risk the IRS recharacterizes this as something other than a royalty?

### Q41: Banking — Singapore Bank Acceptance
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** CI IBC owned by a Panama PIF. Need a Singapore bank account for primary operations (multi-currency, Stripe integration, international wires).
**Question:** Which Singapore banks accept Cook Islands IBCs owned by Panama PIFs? What documentation is required for KYC? Is in-person account opening required?

### Q42: CRS/AEOI Reporting Obligations
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Cook Islands participates in CRS/AEOI. The CI IBC will have bank accounts in Singapore and potentially UAE. Founders reside in UAE, US, and Cyprus.
**Question:** What are the specific CRS/AEOI reporting obligations for the CI IBC? What information is automatically exchanged with founder-resident jurisdictions? Any action items to ensure compliance?

### Q43: Asset Protection — Structuring for Maximum Benefit
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Cook Islands is the #1 asset protection jurisdiction. The PIF → CI IBC chain provides two layers of protection.
**Question:** Are there any additional structuring steps (e.g., CI trust layer, specific Articles of Association provisions) that would maximize asset protection for LB's IP and revenue?

---

## 8. Cyprus Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** Months 1-2. Validates the Cyprus founder's personal strategy. (Question numbers unchanged from original for cross-reference stability.)

### Q27: 90-Day Exemption for Large Salary
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** The Cyprus founder will receive $500K-$800K in salary from the UAE entity (a non-resident employer) for work performed outside Cyprus >90 days/year.
**Question:** Confirm that a co-founder salary at this level qualifies for the overseas employment exemption. At what point might Cyprus tax authorities argue the salary is disguised dividend?

### Q28: GESY on Exempt Salary
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** If the salary is exempt from income tax under the 90-day rule, it's unclear whether GESY (2.65%) still applies.
**Question:** Is the overseas employment exemption also exempt from GESY contributions?

### Q29: Interest SDC Rate Post-Reform
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The 2026 reform reduced SDC on dividends to 5%. It's unclear whether the interest SDC rate also changed.
**Question:** Was the interest SDC rate reduced from 17%, or does only the dividend rate change?

### Q30: PIF Distribution Classification
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The Cyprus founder may receive distributions from the Panama PIF. Classification determines tax rate: dividends (5% SDC), "other income" (progressive rates up to 35%), or concealed dividends (10% SDC).
**Question:** Confirm that PIF distributions are classified as dividends for SDC purposes.

### Q31: Concealed Dividends Scope
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The 2026 reform introduced 10% SDC on concealed dividends. The scope is unclear.
**Question:** How broadly will the concealed dividends rule be applied? Does it only target Cyprus company shareholders, or could PIF beneficiaries be caught? What specific arrangements trigger it?

### Q32: Crypto SDC
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Article 20E imposes 8% flat tax on crypto gains. Whether SDC applies on top is unclear.
**Question:** Does SDC apply on top of the 8% Article 20E rate?

---

## 9. Forward-Looking Questions

These do not need immediate answers but should be tracked for future counsel engagements.

### Q33: OECD Pillar Two Monitoring
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Pillar Two imposes a 15% global minimum tax on groups with EUR 750M+ revenue. TE is well below this threshold.
**Question:** At what revenue level should we begin preparing for Pillar Two compliance? What structural changes would be needed?

### Q34: Tokenization Regulatory Path
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** If TE tokenizes the villa program or creates a booking/loyalty token, the issuing entity and jurisdiction matter.
**Question:** Which entity issues tokens and from which jurisdiction? MiCA (EU/Cyprus), VARA (Dubai), or another framework?

### Q35: Exit Structure
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** If the company is acquired (strategic exit), proceeds flow through the PIF → UAE → acquirer chain.
**Question:** How does a sale proceed through this structure to maximize after-tax proceeds? What are the tax implications for each founder?

### Q36: Expansion Template
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Each new healing center location (Costa Rica, Jamaica, Portugal, Thailand) would add an OpCo under the UAE entity.
**Question:** What is the standard template for adding a new country OpCo? Treaty analysis, TP study, REFIPRE-equivalent check, local substance requirements?
