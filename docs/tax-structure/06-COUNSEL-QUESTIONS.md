## How to Use This Document

Bring the relevant section to each counsel meeting. Questions are organized by jurisdiction and prioritized:

- **CRITICAL** — Must resolve before spending money on entity formation. Answer determines structure.
- **IMPORTANT** — Must resolve during formation. Answer affects implementation details.
- **FORWARD** — Resolve when operationally relevant. No urgency.

---

## 1. UAE Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** First meeting. This is the gating engagement — do not spend money on entity formation until Q1 is resolved.

### Q1: QFZP Viability for Natural Persons Revenue
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** UAE QFZP rules exclude "transactions with natural persons" from qualifying income. TE's guests are natural persons. If revenue doesn't qualify for 0%, the entire UAE structure shifts to 9% CT.
**Question:** Does revenue from individual guests paying for access to a copyrighted AI software platform qualify as income from Qualifying Intellectual Property under QFZP rules?
**What depends on the answer:** If yes, proceed with UAE structure. If no, evaluate 9% rate (still favorable) or pivot to Singapore Pioneer Certificate.

### Q2: B2B Alternative Structure
**Priority:** CRITICAL (if Q1 is negative)
**Context:** If direct B2C revenue doesn't qualify, a B2B intermediary (corporate booking entity) might.
**Question:** If Q1 is negative, is there a structural alternative (e.g., B2B booking entity, platform access agreement) that would qualify the revenue?

### Q3: Panama PIF as Sole Shareholder
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The PIF will be the 100% shareholder of the DIC FZ-LLC. Some free zones have restrictions on foreign foundation ownership.
**Question:** Can a Panama PIF serve as sole shareholder of a DIC FZ-LLC without triggering adverse QFZP or substance implications?

### Q4: Content License from US Church
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The church pays the UAE entity an arm's-length license fee for content. This fee flows from a US entity to a UAE entity.
**Question:** Is a content license fee from a US 508(c)(1)(A) church to the UAE entity treated as qualifying income under QFZP?

### Q5: Minimum Substance Threshold
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The UAE entity will earn $10-35M/year. Substance must be proportional.
**Question:** What is the minimum substance threshold for a technology company earning $10-35M/year in DIC? Is 5-6 employees sufficient, or does the FTA expect more?

## 2. US Religious Nonprofit Attorney

**Engagement:** Parallel with UAE counsel. Validates the church structure.

### Q6: 508(c)(1)(A) Eligibility with Content Licensing Model
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** The church licenses content from the UAE entity and distributes it to followers. Revenue comes from content sales, donations, and speaking fees — not program fees (those go to the UAE entity).
**Question:** Does this content licensing + distribution model maintain 508(c)(1)(A) eligibility? Are there any structural features that could jeopardize church status?

### Q7: State of Incorporation
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The church needs a US state for incorporation. Different states have different nonprofit laws, property tax treatment, and regulatory environments.
**Question:** What is the optimal state of incorporation for the Church of the Living Light? Factors: property tax exemption on parsonage, favorable nonprofit law, minimal regulatory burden, no state income tax on exempt entities.

### Q8: Dual Housing Allowances
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Both the US founder and Canadian founder are ordained ministers. Both could receive housing allowances.
**Question:** Can both founders receive housing allowances simultaneously from the same church? Any limitations on dual designations?

### Q9: Content License Agreement Language
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The arm's-length content license between the UAE entity and the church is critical for IP ownership (DEMPE) and church independence.
**Question:** What required language should the content license agreement contain to preserve both the church's exempt status and the UAE entity's IP ownership?

---

## 3. US International Tax Attorney

**Engagement:** Parallel with above. Confirms the US founder's personal tax position.

### Q10: No-Ownership CFC Elimination
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** The US founder is an employee of the UAE entity but is NOT a beneficiary of the PIF that owns it. This should eliminate all CFC/GILTI exposure.
**Question:** Confirm that no-ownership (employee-only, not PIF beneficiary, no signatory authority, no control rights) eliminates all CFC/GILTI/Subpart F exposure for the US founder. Are there any constructive ownership or attribution rules that could reach through the PIF?

### Q11: Dual Employment Tax Traps
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The US founder receives salary from both a UAE entity and a US church simultaneously.
**Question:** Are there any dual-employment tax traps? Can FEIE apply to the UAE salary while the church salary is taxed normally? Any SE tax complications from the dual arrangement?

### Q12: Housing Allowance for Overseas Minister
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The US founder lives in Dubai but is an ordained minister of a US church.
**Question:** Does IRC 107 housing allowance apply even if the minister lives outside the US? Can the Dubai residence qualify?

### Q13: FEIE + Housing Allowance Stacking
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The US founder claims FEIE on UAE salary and housing allowance on church compensation. These are different income sources.
**Question:** Can FEIE and housing allowance stack (since they apply to different income sources)? Any interaction effects?

### Q14: Form 4361 Eligibility
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Ministers can opt out of SE tax via Form 4361, saving 15.3% on both salary and housing allowance.
**Question:** Can the US founder qualify for Form 4361 (SE tax opt-out) as an ordained minister? What are the requirements and what is forfeited (Social Security, Medicare)?

### Q15: Section 962 as Fallback
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** If the no-ownership structure is ever reconsidered and the US founder takes an equity stake, Section 962 election would cap GILTI at corporate rates (~10.5%).
**Question:** Model the effective tax rate under employee-only ($130K+ salary) vs. CFC ownership with Section 962 election, given projected TE income of $4-21M EBITDA over Years 1-5.

## 4. Canadian Emigration Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** IMMEDIATELY. This is time-sensitive — must complete before the seed round closes.

### Q16: Departure Tax Timing
**Priority:** CRITICAL — TIME-SENSITIVE
**Context:** Departure tax is based on FMV at departure date. Pre-revenue, pre-raise = minimal FMV. After the seed round ($29.35M post-money), the bill becomes significant. Every month of delay increases the liability.
**Question:** Can the founder complete departure (sever ties, establish UAE residency, file NR73) BEFORE the seed round closes? What is the defensible FMV of the founder's equity at pre-revenue stage?

### Q17: NR73 Filing Strategy
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** NR73 is optional but provides written CRA confirmation of non-resident status.
**Question:** Should the founder file NR73 proactively (for certainty) or wait for a CRA inquiry (to avoid drawing attention)?

### Q18: PIF Look-Through Risk
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** After departure, the founder is PIF Protector and beneficiary. CRA could potentially argue the PIF is a conduit.
**Question:** Under which circumstances (if any) could the CRA look through the Panama PIF and attribute income to the founder post-departure? What protections are needed? Does departure eliminate all CFC/FAPI exposure?

### Q19: Departure Tax Security
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Departure tax can be deferred with security posted.
**Question:** If any departure tax is owed, what forms of security does the CRA accept? Can deferral reduce the immediate cash impact?

---

## 5. Panama Counsel

**Engagement:** Weeks 2-4. Entity formation.

### Q20: PIF Structuring for Mixed Founders
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Canadian founder is Protector and beneficiary. US founder must be explicitly excluded to avoid CFC. Cyprus founder may be added as beneficiary (5% SDC on distributions).
**Question:** Optimal PIF structuring: single PIF with careful beneficiary designations, or separate PIFs? Can the US founder serve on the Foundation Council without triggering grantor trust status?

### Q21: Foundation Council Independence
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The PIF must be an independent legal person — not a sham or alter ego of the founders.
**Question:** What degree of founder involvement in the Foundation Council is acceptable without the PIF being recharacterized? Should all three Council members be independent?

### Q22: Banking and KYC
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The PIF needs a bank account (Panama or Singapore) and must provide KYC documents for the UAE entity's bank.
**Question:** What apostilled documents will be needed for UAE bank KYC? Which banks are experienced with PIF-owned holding structures?

---

## 6. Mexican Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** Months 3-5. Before Mexico OpCo formation.

### Q23: REFIPRE Classification
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The Platform-as-Principal model means revenue flows INTO the UAE entity from guests, and service fees flow DOWN to Mexico. There are no upward payments from Mexico to zero-tax jurisdictions. But SAT may still scrutinize the structure.
**Question:** Confirm that the Platform-as-Principal model (UAE entity collects revenue, pays service fee to Mexico OpCo) does NOT trigger REFIPRE. Does SAT classify this based on the direction of payment or the overall structure?

### Q24: Transfer Pricing on Service Fee
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Mexico OpCo receives cost + 8-12% margin from the UAE entity.
**Question:** Is 8-12% a defensible arm's-length margin for a service delivery arrangement? What comparable data should the TP study include?

### Q25: PE Risk from Founder Travel
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** Founders may visit the Tulum facility regularly for oversight, ceremonies, and program development.
**Question:** How many days can founders spend at the Tulum facility before creating a PE risk for the UAE entity? What activities are safe vs. risky?

### Q26: Treaty WHT on Service Fees
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Mexico-UAE have no bilateral tax treaty. Service fees from UAE to Mexico could face WHT questions.
**Question:** What is the WHT treatment of inbound service fees from a UAE entity to a Mexican OpCo? Any issues with the lack of a Mexico-UAE treaty?

---

## 7. Cyprus Tax Counsel

**Engagement:** Months 1-2. Validates the Cyprus founder's personal strategy.

### Q27: 90-Day Exemption for Large Salary
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Context:** The Cyprus founder will receive $500K-$800K in salary from the UAE entity (a non-resident employer) for work performed outside Cyprus >90 days/year.
**Question:** Confirm that a co-founder salary at this level qualifies for the overseas employment exemption. At what point might Cyprus tax authorities argue the salary is disguised dividend?

### Q28: GESY on Exempt Salary
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** If the salary is exempt from income tax under the 90-day rule, it's unclear whether GESY (2.65%) still applies.
**Question:** Is the overseas employment exemption also exempt from GESY contributions?

### Q29: Interest SDC Rate Post-Reform
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The 2026 reform reduced SDC on dividends to 5%. It's unclear whether the interest SDC rate also changed.
**Question:** Was the interest SDC rate reduced from 17%, or does only the dividend rate change?

### Q30: PIF Distribution Classification
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The Cyprus founder may receive distributions from the Panama PIF. Classification determines tax rate: dividends (5% SDC), "other income" (progressive rates up to 35%), or concealed dividends (10% SDC).
**Question:** Confirm that PIF distributions are classified as dividends for SDC purposes.

### Q31: Concealed Dividends Scope
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Context:** The 2026 reform introduced 10% SDC on concealed dividends. The scope is unclear.
**Question:** How broadly will the concealed dividends rule be applied? Does it only target Cyprus company shareholders, or could PIF beneficiaries be caught? What specific arrangements trigger it?

### Q32: Crypto SDC
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Article 20E imposes 8% flat tax on crypto gains. Whether SDC applies on top is unclear.
**Question:** Does SDC apply on top of the 8% Article 20E rate?

---

## 8. Forward-Looking Questions

These do not need immediate answers but should be tracked for future counsel engagements.

### Q33: OECD Pillar Two Monitoring
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Pillar Two imposes a 15% global minimum tax on groups with EUR 750M+ revenue. TE is well below this threshold.
**Question:** At what revenue level should we begin preparing for Pillar Two compliance? What structural changes would be needed?

### Q34: Tokenization Regulatory Path
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** If TE tokenizes the villa program or creates a booking/loyalty token, the issuing entity and jurisdiction matter.
**Question:** Which entity issues tokens and from which jurisdiction? MiCA (EU/Cyprus), VARA (Dubai), or another framework?

### Q35: Exit Structure
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** If the company is acquired (strategic exit), proceeds flow through the PIF → UAE → acquirer chain.
**Question:** How does a sale proceed through this structure to maximize after-tax proceeds? What are the tax implications for each founder?

### Q36: Expansion Template
**Priority:** FORWARD
**Context:** Each new healing center location (Costa Rica, Jamaica, Portugal, Thailand) would add an OpCo under the UAE entity.
**Question:** What is the standard template for adding a new country OpCo? Treaty analysis, TP study, REFIPRE-equivalent check, local substance requirements?
