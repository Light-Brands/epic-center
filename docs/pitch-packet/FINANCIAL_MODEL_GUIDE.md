# Financial Model Structure Guide

> *Financial projections aligned with Executive Summary v2.0*

## Overview

This document outlines the structure for our financial model - both the spreadsheet version for due diligence and the interactive web version for the investor portal.

**Key Financial Targets** (from Executive Summary):
- **Base Rate**: $2,000/day
- **Year 1 Revenue**: ~$3.6M (50% occupancy, 120+ guests)
- **Year 3 Revenue**: ~$5.1M (70% occupancy, 170+ guests)
- **Year 5 Revenue**: ~$11.7M (2 locations, 300+ guests)

---

## Model Philosophy

**Principles**:
1. **Transparency** - All assumptions clearly labeled and adjustable
2. **Conservatism** - Base case is realistic, not optimistic
3. **Simplicity** - Easy to understand, hard to misinterpret
4. **Defensibility** - Every number has a rationale

- Average revenue per guest: $30,000 (~15-day stay)
- Net Promoter Score: 80+
- Zero serious safety incidents
- 40%+ of guests from referrals

## Scenario Modeling

### Conservative Case
- Slower occupancy ramp (40% → 60% → 70%)
- Lower pricing (15% below base)
- Higher costs (10% above base)
- Delayed expansion

### Base Case
- Moderate occupancy ramp (50% → 70% → 85%)
- Current pricing assumptions
- Current cost assumptions
- Planned expansion timeline

### Aggressive Case
- Fast occupancy ramp (60% → 80% → 90%)
- Premium pricing (+10%)
- Efficient operations (-5% costs)
- Accelerated expansion

---

## Model Maintenance

### Update Frequency
- Monthly: Actual vs. projected comparison
- Quarterly: Assumption review
- Per-milestone: Full model refresh

### Version Control
- Save dated versions before major changes
- Document assumption changes
- Track variance explanations

---

## Investor Q&A Preparation

### Common Financial Questions

1. **"What's your CAC assumption based on?"**
   - [Answer with channel breakdown and industry comps]

2. **"How did you arrive at pricing?"**
   - [Answer with value-based rationale and comp analysis]

3. **"What happens if occupancy is lower?"**
   - [Walk through sensitivity analysis]

4. **"When do you need more capital?"**
   - [Show runway analysis and Series A timing]

5. **"What's the path to profitability?"**
   - [Walk through break-even and margin expansion]
