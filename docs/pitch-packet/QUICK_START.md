2. **Personalized Pages** - Every investor gets custom experience

## Common Questions

**Q: Why not just use a normal pitch deck?**
A: We're competing for attention with hundreds of other startups. An interactive experience demonstrates our capabilities while presenting our vision. The pitch itself becomes a product demo.

**Q: How long will this take to build?**
A: MVP portal in 2 weeks, full experience in 6-8 weeks. We can start outreach with basic version and improve iteratively.

**Q: What if investors just want a PDF?**
A: We'll have traditional materials too (one-pager, exec summary, deck PDF). The portal is for those who want to go deeper.

**Q: Is this too much effort for a seed raise?**
A: The portal becomes a permanent asset. It scales our outreach, saves time on repetitive explanations, and positions us as serious operators.
