## What Is This?

This folder contains the complete strategy and specifications for a **100% digital pitch packet** to raise $5M. Unlike traditional PDF decks, we're building an interactive investor experience that demonstrates our technical capabilities while presenting our vision.

**The Opportunity**: A $5.6 trillion market across four segments (Medical & Longevity, Luxury Wellness, Biohacking, Plant Medicine) with no single player unifying them into a coherent transformation journey.

---

## The Core Investment Thesis

**Why Competitors Can't Copy This:**

| Competitor Type | Why They Won't Integrate All 4 Pillars |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Medical Clinics (Clinique La Prairie, SHA Wellness) | Won't touch plant medicine—regulatory risk |
| Luxury Resorts (Aman, Six Senses) | Lack medical expertise & infrastructure |
| Plant Medicine Centers (Beond, Rythmia) | Can't attract luxury talent or afford medical |
| Biohacking Centers (Upgrade Labs, Restore) | Transactional model, not transformational |

**Our 8 Operational Segments:**
1. Medical & Scientific Oversight (24/7, hospital-grade)
2. Plant Medicine (Iboga/Ibogaine, medically supervised)
3. Advanced Bio-Optimization & Longevity
4. Trauma Integration & Nervous System Restoration
5. Five-Star Hospitality, Nutrition & Functional Fitness
6. Digital Ecosystem & Community Support (AI-powered)
7. Pre-Care (4-8 weeks preparation)
8. Post-Care (3-12+ months integration)
