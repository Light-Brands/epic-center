# Epic-Center Technology Budget Review

**For:** Internal Team Budget Meeting
**Date:** February 2026
**Classification:** Internal — Not for External Distribution

---

## TL;DR

**$750K buys a $2-4M technology platform.** This is 4.3% of the $17.3M raise, delivering 14 integrated systems including HIPAA-compliant medical infrastructure, a mobile aftercare app, AI personalization, biometric monitoring, telemedicine, and a full clinical protocol engine. A significant portion is already built and generating value. This price point is only possible because of Light Brands' AI-augmented development methodology.

## 1. The Investment in Context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Technology Budget** | $750,000 |
| **Total Raise** | $17,323,500 |
| **Tech as % of Raise** | 4.3% |
| **Technology Standalone Value (Base)** | $7,500,000 |
| **Technology Standalone Value (Range)** | $5,000,000 — $10,000,000 |
| **Value Multiple** | 10x on investment |

For context — $750K is less than what most startups spend on a single product engineer's fully-loaded cost over 3 years. We're building an enterprise-grade clinical platform with it.

## 6. Why It Works at This Price

### The Light Brands AI Development Methodology

Traditional software development:
- **Team of 8-12 engineers** for 12-18 months
- Senior architect ($250K), 2 senior devs ($200K each), 2 mid devs ($150K each), mobile dev ($180K), designer ($160K), PM ($170K), QA ($130K)
- Fully loaded: **$1.6M — $2.4M in labor alone**, before infrastructure, tools, and overhead

Light Brands approach:
- **AI-augmented development** with Claude as a force multiplier
- One senior architect/developer directing AI agents that produce production-quality code
- 10-20x productivity on boilerplate, UI components, data modeling, and standard patterns
- Human expertise focused on architecture decisions, clinical domain modeling, and security

### What the AI Leverage Means Concretely

| Traditional | AI-Augmented | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| 2 weeks to build a financial dashboard page | 1-2 days | 5-10x faster |
| Designer + frontend dev for each page | AI generates from design system | 80% cost reduction |
| Separate mobile team for aftercare app | Shared codebase, AI-generated components | 60% cost reduction |
| Manual QA cycles | AI-assisted testing + automated checks | 50% cost reduction |
| 6-month runway to first working product | Investor platform live in weeks | Immediate value |

### What Still Requires Human Expertise

- HIPAA security architecture and compliance review
- Pharmacogenomic algorithm design and clinical validation
- Integration with medical devices (biosensors, EEG systems)
- Third-party API integrations (payment, telemedicine, EHR standards)
- Clinical workflow design with medical team input
- Security audits and penetration testing

## 7. Ongoing Costs — Annual Run Rate

After the $750K build, the platform requires ongoing infrastructure and maintenance.

| Category | Annual Cost | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/Vercel) | $24,000 — $48,000 | HIPAA-compliant hosting, scales with guest volume |
| Telemedicine Service (Twilio/Daily) | $12,000 — $24,000 | Video infrastructure, per-minute pricing |
| EHR/Medical APIs | $12,000 — $24,000 | HL7/FHIR integration services |
| Monitoring & Security | $6,000 — $12,000 | HIPAA audit logging, uptime monitoring, WAF |
| Mobile App Stores | $1,000 | Apple + Google developer accounts |
| Domain & SSL | $500 | Annual renewals |
| **Maintenance & Updates** | $60,000 — $120,000 | Bug fixes, OS updates, security patches, feature iteration |
| **Total Annual Run Rate** | **$115,500 — $229,500** | |

This maps to the `technology: $228,000` operating expense in the Y1 P&L (line 197 of `data.ts`), escalating at 4%/yr.

## 8. The Technology as a Business Unit

Per the valuation model, the Technology & Digital Platform is one of 4 standalone business units:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Valuation Method** | Cost-replacement + scalability optionality |
| **Conservative Value** | $5,000,000 |
| **Base Value** | $7,500,000 |
| **Aggressive Value** | $10,000,000 |
| **Investment** | $750,000 |
| **Value Creation Multiple** | 6.7x — 13.3x |

The platform also enables:
- **60% cost reduction** for new-site deployment (Tulum architecture deploys to Costa Rica, Jamaica, etc.)
- **IP ownership** in the Netherlands tech entity (TE Global Technology B.V.)
- **Platform extracts 30-38%** of healing center revenue through intercompany charges at scale
- **Year 5 tech entity revenue: ~$18.4M** across locations (from Total Technology Envelope Strategy)

## 9. Open Items for Discussion

1. **Phase prioritization** — Do we front-load the clinical systems (Protocol Engine, Biometric Monitoring) or the guest-facing systems (Portal, CRM, Aftercare App)? Clinical is required for operations; guest-facing drives bookings.

2. **Mobile app scope** — Full native (iOS + Android) vs. progressive web app (PWA) for the aftercare platform. Native costs more but provides push notifications, offline-first, and Apple Health/Google Fit integration.

3. **EHR buy vs. build** — License an existing HIPAA-compliant EHR and integrate, or build a purpose-built clinical record system? Off-the-shelf saves time but limits customization; custom-built aligns perfectly with the AI engine.

4. **Medical device integration timeline** — The biometric monitoring system depends on selecting specific wearable devices and negotiating API access. This should happen in parallel with Phase 1.

5. **HIPAA compliance audit** — Budget for an external HIPAA compliance audit before going live with patient data. Typically $15K-30K for a Type 1 assessment.

6. **Ongoing development budget post-launch** — The $115K-230K annual run rate covers maintenance. Feature development for subsequent years (new AI capabilities, additional channels, scaling) may require separate allocation.
