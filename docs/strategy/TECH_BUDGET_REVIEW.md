# Epic-Center Technology Budget Review

**For:** Internal Team Budget Meeting
**Date:** February 2026
**Classification:** Internal — Not for External Distribution

---

## TL;DR

**$750K builds a $2-4M platform. $228K/yr keeps it alive. ~$1M Year 1 all-in, ~$2.25M over 5 years.** The $750K capital allocation delivers 14 integrated systems including HIPAA-compliant medical infrastructure, a mobile aftercare app, AI personalization, biometric monitoring, telemedicine, and a full clinical protocol engine. The ongoing $19K/mo technology operating budget covers 2 support engineers, AI APIs, hosting, cybersecurity, and equipment maintenance. An additional on-site IT person ($3K/mo) is already in the personnel budget. A significant portion of the platform is already built and generating value. This price point is only possible because of Light Brands' AI-augmented development methodology.

## 1. The Investment in Context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Technology CapEx (Build)** | $750,000 |
| **Technology OpEx (Annual)** | $228,000 ($19,000/mo) |
| **On-Site IT Staff (in Personnel)** | $48,240/yr ($4,020/mo incl. benefits) |
| **Year 1 Total Tech Spend** | ~$1,026,000 |
| **5-Year Total Tech Spend** | ~$2,245,000 |
| **Total Raise** | $17,323,500 |
| **Tech CapEx as % of Raise** | 4.3% |
| **Technology Standalone Value (Base)** | $7,500,000 |
| **Value Creation Multiple** | 3.3x on 5-year all-in spend |

The $750K is the capital build budget. But technology also has a monthly burn — 2 ongoing engineers, AI APIs, hosting, cybersecurity, SaaS licenses, and equipment maintenance. This is modeled in the P&L as a separate $228K/yr operating expense line, plus a dedicated on-site IT person in the personnel budget. All of it is already accounted for in the financial model.

---

## 7. Why It Works at This Price

### The Light Brands AI Development Methodology

Traditional software development:
- **Team of 8-12 engineers** for 12-18 months
- Senior architect ($250K), 2 senior devs ($200K each), 2 mid devs ($150K each), mobile dev ($180K), designer ($160K), PM ($170K), QA ($130K)
- Fully loaded: **$1.6M — $2.4M in labor alone**, before infrastructure, tools, and overhead

Light Brands approach:
- **AI-augmented development** with Claude as a force multiplier
- One senior architect/developer directing AI agents that produce production-quality code
- 10-20x productivity on boilerplate, UI components, data modeling, and standard patterns
- Human expertise focused on architecture decisions, clinical domain modeling, and security

### What the AI Leverage Means Concretely

| Traditional | AI-Augmented | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| 2 weeks to build a financial dashboard page | 1-2 days | 5-10x faster |
| Designer + frontend dev for each page | AI generates from design system | 80% cost reduction |
| Separate mobile team for aftercare app | Shared codebase, AI-generated components | 60% cost reduction |
| Manual QA cycles | AI-assisted testing + automated checks | 50% cost reduction |
| 6-month runway to first working product | Investor platform live in weeks | Immediate value |

### What Still Requires Human Expertise

- HIPAA security architecture and compliance review
- Pharmacogenomic algorithm design and clinical validation
- Integration with medical devices (biosensors, EEG systems)
- Third-party API integrations (payment, telemedicine, EHR standards)
- Clinical workflow design with medical team input
- Security audits and penetration testing

## 8. The Monthly Technology Burn — What Keeps the Platform Running

After the $750K build, technology has a dedicated $19,000/mo operating budget plus a tech person already embedded in the personnel budget. This is not optional — it's what keeps 14 systems secure, updated, and operational for a HIPAA-compliant medical facility.

### Technology OpEx — $228,000/yr ($19,000/mo)

This is a standalone line item in the P&L, separate from personnel.

| Line Item | Monthly | Annual | What It Covers |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Engineering Team (ongoing)** | **$10,000** | **$120,000** | **2 engineers — bug fixes, security patches, feature iteration, OS updates** |
| AI API Costs | $2,000 | $24,000 | Claude, OpenAI, embeddings — powers personalization, screening, chatbot |
| Infrastructure & Hosting | $2,000 | $24,000 | Supabase, Vercel, AWS — HIPAA-compliant cloud hosting |
| Cybersecurity & Monitoring | $1,500 | $18,000 | Sentry, Datadog, annual pen testing — required for HIPAA |
| Software Licenses & SaaS | $1,500 | $18,000 | Twilio (telemedicine), SendGrid (comms), video platform |
| Equipment Maintenance | $2,000 | $24,000 | Wearable replacements, tablet repairs, camera/network upkeep |
| **Total Technology OpEx** | **$19,000** | **$228,000** | **Escalates 4%/yr per the financial model** |

### Why 2 Ongoing Engineers

The 2-engineer ongoing team is the minimum for a HIPAA-compliant medical platform:

- **Security patches and compliance** — HIPAA requires continuous monitoring, vulnerability remediation, and audit trail maintenance. A medical platform cannot go unpatched.
- **Platform iteration** — Clinical protocols evolve. Guest feedback drives UX improvements. New wearable devices need integration. The platform is a living system, not a finished product.
- **Uptime and incident response** — A system monitoring patient vitals and managing clinical data needs someone on call. Downtime is not an option during active treatment.
- **At $5K/mo each** — This is realistic for LATAM-based or Mexico-based engineers handling maintenance, DevOps, and feature work. Not Bay Area rates.

### On-Site IT Staff — Already in Personnel Budget

The Assumptions sheet includes one dedicated IT/Technology person in the personnel line:

| Role | Monthly (Base) | Monthly (w/ 34% Benefits) | Annual |
|------|---------------|--------------------------|--------|
| IT/Technology (1 person) | $3,000 | $4,020 | $48,240 |

This person handles **on-site systems** — network infrastructure, guest tablets, security cameras, access control, communication systems, and wearable device troubleshooting. They are the bridge between the remote engineering team and the physical technology infrastructure at the facility.

### 5-Year Technology OpEx Projection

The 4% annual escalation is modeled in the Operating Expenses sheet:

| Year | Technology OpEx | IT Personnel (est.) | Combined |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Year 1 | $228,000 | $48,240 | $276,240 |
| Year 2 | $237,120 | $50,170 | $287,290 |
| Year 3 | $246,605 | $52,177 | $298,782 |
| Year 4 | $256,469 | $54,264 | $310,733 |
| Year 5 | $266,728 | $56,434 | $323,162 |
| **5-Year Total** | **$1,234,922** | **$261,285** | **$1,496,207** |

---

## 9. Total Technology Investment — The Complete Picture

Everything the company spends on technology, across all budget lines:

| Category | Year 1 | 5-Year Total | Budget Line |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **CapEx — Platform Build** | $750,000 | $750,000 | Use of Funds: Technology |
| **OpEx — Technology & Systems** | $228,000 | $1,234,922 | P&L: Technology operating expense |
| **OpEx — On-Site IT Person** | $48,240 | ~$261,000 | P&L: Personnel (embedded) |
| **Total Technology Spend** | **$1,026,240** | **~$2,246,000** | |

### How to Talk About This

- **"The build costs $750K"** — True. That's the one-time capital allocation for platform development + physical infrastructure.
- **"Technology runs $19K/mo after that"** — True. 2 engineers, AI APIs, hosting, cybersecurity, SaaS, equipment.
- **"There's also an IT person on-site"** — True. $3K/mo base ($4K with benefits), already in the staffing plan alongside the 67 other staff.
- **"Total Year 1 tech is about $1M"** — True. $750K build + $228K ops + $48K IT person.
- **"Over 5 years, total tech investment is ~$2.25M"** — True. And the platform is valued at $5-10M.

The key point: **even the full $2.25M 5-year number is still less than what the platform build alone would cost at market rates ($2.2-4.4M).** We're getting the build *and* 5 years of operations for what others pay just for the build.

## 10. The Technology as a Business Unit

Per the valuation model, the Technology & Digital Platform is one of 4 standalone business units:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Valuation Method** | Cost-replacement + scalability optionality |
| **Conservative Value** | $5,000,000 |
| **Base Value** | $7,500,000 |
| **Aggressive Value** | $10,000,000 |
| **Investment** | $750,000 |
| **Value Creation Multiple** | 6.7x — 13.3x |

The platform also enables:
- **60% cost reduction** for new-site deployment (Tulum architecture deploys to Costa Rica, Jamaica, etc.)
- **IP ownership** in the Netherlands tech entity (TE Global Technology B.V.)
- **Platform extracts 30-38%** of healing center revenue through intercompany charges at scale
- **Year 5 tech entity revenue: ~$18.4M** across locations (from Total Technology Envelope Strategy)

---

## 11. Open Items for Discussion

1. **Phase prioritization** — Do we front-load the clinical systems (Protocol Engine, Biometric Monitoring) or the guest-facing systems (Portal, CRM, Aftercare App)? Clinical is required for operations; guest-facing drives bookings.

2. **Mobile app scope** — Full native (iOS + Android) vs. progressive web app (PWA) for the aftercare platform. Native costs more but provides push notifications, offline-first, and Apple Health/Google Fit integration.

3. **EHR buy vs. build** — License an existing HIPAA-compliant EHR and integrate, or build a purpose-built clinical record system? Off-the-shelf saves time but limits customization; custom-built aligns perfectly with the AI engine.

4. **Medical device integration timeline** — The biometric monitoring system depends on selecting specific wearable devices and negotiating API access. This should happen in parallel with Phase 1.

5. **HIPAA compliance audit** — Budget for an external HIPAA compliance audit before going live with patient data. Typically $15K-30K for a Type 1 assessment.

6. **Ongoing development budget post-launch** — The $115K-230K annual run rate covers maintenance. Feature development for subsequent years (new AI capabilities, additional channels, scaling) may require separate allocation.
