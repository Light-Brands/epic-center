## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents three distinct, optimized investment strategies for raising $15–17 million in capital across two vehicles — a Real Estate vehicle (~$10–12M) and an Operating/Management Company (~$5M) — for the Transformational Epicenter project.

Each strategy is designed around a single overriding principle: **founders contribute vision, IP, brand, execution, and management — not cash capital.** One hundred percent of the capital is raised from investors. The structures are engineered to provide investors with strong downside protection and attractive risk-adjusted returns while preserving maximum control, ownership, and long-term optionality for founders.

### Capital Target

| Vehicle | Amount | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Real Estate SPV / Fund | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 | Property acquisition via fideicomiso, renovation, medical conversion |
| Operating / Management Company | $5,000,000 | Operations, staff, programs, marketing, technology, working capital |
| **Total** | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** | |

### Strategy Overview

| | Strategy 1 | Strategy 2 | Strategy 3 |
|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Name** | Preferred Equity + Mandatory Redemption | Secured Debt + Revenue Participation | Real Estate Fund + Convertible Operating Capital |
| **Character** | Bond-like safety for RE investors; venture equity for OpCo | Credit fund friendly; maximum day-one founder ownership | Institutional fund structure; milestone-driven conversion |
| **Founder RE dilution** | 0% permanent (preferred equity carries no voting or common ownership) | 0% (debt creates no ownership) | 0–49% LP equity (GP retains control regardless) |
| **Founder OpCo dilution** | 20–25% permanent; remainder self-liquidates | 30% equity | 15–20% permanent + up to 10% if convertible notes convert |
| **Best-fit investors** | Family offices, yield-oriented HNW, real estate allocators | Credit funds, fixed-income family offices, HNW lenders | Institutional PE, sophisticated angels, venture-oriented family offices |

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Principles

These principles are absolute constraints that every strategy must satisfy. They are not subject to negotiation regardless of investor demand.

### 2.1 Founders Contribute No Cash Capital

All capital is raised from investors. Founders contribute:
- Strategic vision and opportunity identification
- Intellectual property, brand, and clinical protocols
- Technology platform (14 integrated systems, $750K invested to date)
- Executive leadership and operational management
- Network, relationships, and market access

The value of these contributions is substantiated by the Valuation Report, which establishes a $29.35M post-money valuation through a 9-method IPEV-compliant framework, with the founder contribution premium representing $12.53M above the $16.82M cost basis.

> **Source:** `docs/data-room/financial/22-valuation-report.md` — Section 4, Valuation Summary

### 2.2 IP, Brand, AI, and Data Are Untouchable

All intellectual property, brand assets, AI systems, clinical protocols, anonymized outcome databases, and technology platform are held outside investor reach — permanently.

| IP Asset | Owner | Location | Estimated Y5 Value |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| AI Personalization Engine | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands | $3–5M |
| Pharmacogenomic Dosing Platform | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands | $2–4M |
| 14-System Integrated Platform | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands | $3–5M |
| Anonymized Outcome Database | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands | $5–15M+ |
| Brand and Trademarks | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands | $3–5M |
| Clinical Protocols | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands | $2–4M |
| Light Brands Frameworks | Light Brands Consulting Ltd | Cook Islands | $1–4M |

- The Operating Company **licenses** IP from TE Wellness Holdings at arm's length. It does **not** own it.
- Investors in neither the RE vehicle nor the OpCo gain ownership of IP.
- IP is never collateralized, pledged, or encumbered against any debt or investment instrument.
- Licensing fees are priced using comparable uncontrolled transaction (CUT) methodology with transfer pricing documentation.

> **Source:** `docs/strategy/TECHNOLOGY_IP_OFFSHORE_STRATEGY.md` — Sections 3, 6, 11, 12

### 2.3 Founder Control Thresholds

| Vehicle | Minimum Founder Control | Mechanism |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|
| Real Estate Entity | Full management control | GP authority in LP structure; or 100% common equity with investor preferred carrying no votes |
| Operating Company (TE Wellness Holdings) | ≥70% voting control | Class A shares with enhanced voting rights; Panamanian Holdings S.A. holds founder equity |

Protective provisions requiring investor consent are limited to major structural changes: sale of entity, new debt above a defined threshold, related-party transactions above a defined threshold, and changes to governing documents.

### 2.4 Separation of Asset Risk from Operating and IP Risk

The real estate vehicle holds **only** the physical property. The operating company holds **only** the operational business. IP resides in the Cayman holding company. This triple separation ensures:

- Operating liabilities cannot encumber real estate assets
- Real estate liabilities cannot reach IP or operating cash flow
- IP assets are permanently shielded in a zero-tax, asset-protected jurisdiction

> **Source:** `docs/data-room/legal/14-corporate-structure-overview.md` — Section 6

---

## 3. Architecture Foundation

All three strategies are built on the existing seven-entity global architecture spanning five jurisdictions.

### The Seven-Entity Ecosystem

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Role | Tax Rate |
|--------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Panama PIF** | Panama | Ultimate asset protection; owns 100% of Panamanian Holdings S.A. | 0% |
| **Panamanian Holdings S.A.** | Panama | Intermediate holdco; holds ~70% of TE Holdings + 100% of Studio + 100% of CI IBC | 0% (territorial) |
| **TE Wellness Holdings** | Cayman Islands | Owns all TE IP; collects all TE revenue; controls Mexico OpCo; investable vehicle | 0% (unconditional) |
| **Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC** | Dubai, UAE | Shared service center; builds for TE Holdings and Light Brands; employs team | 0% (QFZP) |
| **Light Brands Consulting Ltd** | Cook Islands | External consulting and SaaS; owns LB-specific IP; zero employees | 0% |
| **TE Ops Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.** | Tulum, Mexico | Operates healing facility; employs local staff; delivers guest experience | 30% on margin |
| **Church of the Living Light** | United States | Spiritual mission; dual royalty streams; employs founders as ministers | 0% (exempt) |

### Ownership Chain

```
Panama PIF (independent legal person)
  └── 100% → Panamanian Holdings S.A. (intermediate holdco)
                ├── ~70% → TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — investable vehicle
                │             └── 100% → TE Ops Mexico (operations)
                ├── 100% → Light Brands Studio (Dubai) — service center
                └── 100% → Light Brands Consulting (Cook Islands) — external revenue

Church of the Living Light — independent nonprofit, no owner
```

### The New Entity: TE Real Estate Holdings

Each strategy introduces a **dedicated real estate entity** to hold the Tulum property. The legal form and jurisdiction of this entity vary by strategy. In all cases:

- The property is held via a Mexican S.A. de C.V. subsidiary with a **fideicomiso** (bank trust) for restricted-zone compliance per Article 27, Section I of the Mexican Constitution
- Real estate assets are isolated from operating company liabilities
- IP and brand value remain in TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman), outside the RE vehicle entirely
- The fideicomiso is a 50-year renewable bank trust granting full rights to use, develop, lease, sell, and mortgage the property

## 5. Strategy 1: Preferred Equity with Mandatory Redemption

### Character

**Zero permanent dilution on real estate. Founder-friendly operating company equity. Time-bound investor participation.**

Investors in the RE vehicle receive preferred equity with a fixed cumulative return and a mandatory redemption at Year 5. They have no common ownership, no voting rights, and no permanent equity position. They are economically equivalent to high-yield bondholders with hard asset security. At redemption, founders own 100% of the real estate free and clear.

Operating company investors receive minority preferred equity in TE Wellness Holdings, plus a self-liquidating revenue participation tranche that returns capital without permanent dilution.

---

### 5.1 Overall Structure

**TE Real Estate Holdings, LLC** (Delaware or Cayman)
- 100% common equity held by founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.)
- Preferred equity issued to RE investors — no voting rights, no common ownership
- Property held via Mexican S.A. de C.V. subsidiary + fideicomiso

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- Founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.): ≥75%
- Investors: up to 25% preferred equity
- Additional revenue participation tranche: no equity, economic participation only

```
Panama PIF
  └── 100% → Panamanian Holdings S.A.
                ├── ~75% → TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman)
                │             └── 100% → TE Ops Mexico
                ├── 100% → TE Real Estate Holdings, LLC
                │             └── 100% → TE RE Mexico, S.A. de C.V.

                ├── 100% → Light Brands Studio (Dubai)
                └── 100% → Light Brands Consulting (Cook Islands)

RE Investors → Preferred Equity in TE Real Estate Holdings (no common, no votes)
OpCo Investors → ~25% Preferred Equity in TE Wellness Holdings
OpCo Investors → Revenue Participation Agreement (separate instrument)
```

---

### 5.2 Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Instrument | Amount | Terms |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **RE — Preferred Equity** | Non-voting preferred units | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 | 9% cumulative preferred return; mandatory redemption at Year 5 |
| **OpCo — Preferred Equity** | Class B preferred shares | $2,000,000–$2,500,000 | 20–25% equity; 10% cumulative preferred return; 1x non-participating liquidation preference |
| **OpCo — Revenue Participation** | Revenue participation agreement | $2,500,000–$3,000,000 | 5% of gross TE revenue until 2.0x capital returned; no equity, no voting, no governance |
| **Total** | | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** | |

**How the RE vehicle is capitalized without founder cash:**

The $10–12M in preferred equity from investors capitalizes the RE entity entirely. Founders contribute zero cash. Founders hold 100% of the common equity by virtue of their contribution of the opportunity, the development plan, the entity structure, and the management commitment. The preferred equity sits senior to common in the distribution waterfall but carries no voting rights and no common ownership — it is a return-of-capital-plus-yield instrument with a fixed redemption date.

This is structurally identical to how real estate developers capitalize projects: the capital partner provides 100% of the cash; the developer provides the deal, the plan, and the execution; the capital partner receives a preferred return and gets redeemed; the developer retains 100% of the residual equity.

---

### 5.3 Ownership and Control Outcomes

| Vehicle | At Close | At Year 5 (Post-Redemption) |
|---------|----------|----------------------------|
| **RE — Common Equity** | 100% Founders | 100% Founders |
| **RE — Preferred Equity** | 100% Investors | 0% (redeemed) |
| **RE — Voting Control** | 100% Founders | 100% Founders |
| **OpCo — Equity** | 75% Founders / 25% Investors | 75% Founders / 25% Investors |
| **OpCo — Revenue Participation** | Investors hold economic right only | Self-liquidates at 2.0x |

Investors in the RE vehicle have **zero** permanent ownership. Their participation is time-bound and yield-defined. At Year 5, when the preferred equity is redeemed, founders own the property outright.

---

### 5.4 Investor Return Mechanics

#### RE Preferred Equity Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Preferred Return | 9% cumulative, compounding annually on unreturned capital |
| Distributions | Quarterly, beginning Year 2, from intercompany lease/management fees paid by OpCo to RE entity |
| Mandatory Redemption | Year 5 — RE entity must redeem all preferred equity at original capital + accrued preferred return |
| Optional Early Redemption | Founders may redeem at any time after Month 24 at original capital + accrued preferred return to date |
| Security | First-position lien/mortgage on property via fideicomiso |
| Forced Sale Right | If redemption obligation is not met at Year 5, investors may force sale of property; proceeds satisfy preferred equity first |
| Step-in Management | Triggered if DSCR falls below 1.2x for two consecutive quarters |
| Reporting | Quarterly property financials, annual independent appraisal |

**Illustrative RE Investor Cash Flows (on $10M preferred at 9%):**

| Year | Preferred Accrual | Distribution | Cumulative to Investor |
|------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Year 1 | $900,000 | $0 (accruing) | $0 |
| Year 2 | $981,000 | $500,000 | $500,000 |
| Year 3 | $1,024,290 | $1,000,000 | $1,500,000 |
| Year 4 | $1,006,476 | $1,200,000 | $2,700,000 |
| Year 5 (Redemption) | — | $10,000,000 + remaining accrued | $12,700,000+ |

Estimated total return: $12.7M+ on $10M invested over 5 years. Effective yield: ~5% cash-on-cash in distribution years; ~27% total return at redemption (including accrued preferred).

**Source of Redemption Funds:** By Year 5, cumulative free cash flow exceeds $41M (see Section 4.3). The $10–12M redemption can be funded from retained cash, a conventional bank refinancing against a property that will have appreciated, or a combination.

#### OpCo Preferred Equity Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Preferred Return | 10% cumulative, compounding annually |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In all future equity rounds |
| Board Observer | One seat for lead investor |
| Tag-along Rights | On any founder share transfer |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average, broad-based |
| Information Rights | Monthly KPIs, quarterly financials, annual audit |

#### OpCo Revenue Participation Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Revenue Share | 5% of gross TE Wellness Holdings revenue, paid quarterly |
| Payment Commencement | Month 6 (post-launch) |
| Return Cap | Payments continue until investor receives 2.0x capital invested |
| Equity Dilution | None — purely economic participation |
| Governance Rights | None |
| Founder Redemption | Founders may buy out at any time for remaining 2.0x balance minus payments already received |

**Illustrative Revenue Participation Cash Flows (on $2.75M investment at 5% of revenue):**

| Year | Gross Revenue | 5% Share | Cumulative to Investor |
|------|--------------|----------|----------------------|
| Year 1 (6 months) | $5,150,000 | $257,500 | $257,500 |
| Year 2 | $19,600,000 | $980,000 | $1,237,500 |
| Year 3 | $26,300,000 | $1,315,000 | $2,552,500 |
| Year 4 | $30,500,000 | $1,525,000 | $4,077,500 |
| Year 5 | $34,000,000 | $1,473,500 | $5,500,000 (2.0x cap reached) |

The 2.0x cap ($5.5M) is reached during Year 5. The obligation self-extinguishes. Founders recover 100% of the economic participation once the cap is hit.

### 5.5 Founder Advantage and Control Protections

- **100% common equity** in the RE entity at close, and 100% after redemption at Year 5
- **≥75% equity and voting control** in TE Wellness Holdings
- **GP/Manager authority** over all RE entity decisions — investors hold preferred units only, with no management rights
- **IP permanently held** in TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — outside both investor vehicles
- Revenue participation creates **zero governance rights** and self-liquidates at 2.0x
- Protective provisions limited to: (i) sale of entity, (ii) new debt above $2M threshold, (iii) related-party transactions above $500K, (iv) amendments to governing documents
- Founders retain right to refinance the property at any time and use proceeds to accelerate preferred equity redemption
- **IP licensing creates structural dependency** — the OpCo cannot operate without the IP license from Holdings, which founders control through Panamanian Holdings S.A.

---

### 5.6 Buy-Back / Redemption Mechanics

| Redemption Event | RE Vehicle | OpCo Vehicle |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Mandatory Redemption** | Year 5 — all preferred equity redeemed at original capital + accrued preferred return | None (permanent equity) |
| **Optional Early Redemption** | After Month 24 at original capital + accrued-to-date preferred return | Founders may repurchase up to 10% equity per year at FMV after Year 3 |
| **Revenue Participation Buy-Out** | N/A | At any time: remaining 2.0x balance minus payments already made |
| **Pricing Mechanism** | Fixed: original capital + 9% cumulative compounding | OpCo equity: FMV determined by independent valuation |
| **Failure to Redeem** | 12-month extension at 12% penalty rate; if still unpaid, forced sale right triggers | N/A |
| **Source of Funds** | Retained operating cash, property refinancing, or new capital raise | Operating cash flow |

---

### 5.7 Risk Mitigation and Downside Protection

**For RE Investors:**

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Hard asset security | First-position lien on $10–12M property in Tulum, Q.R. |
| Property floor value | $11.9M appraised value at acquisition; Tulum real estate appreciation averaging 8–12% annually |
| Mandatory redemption | Capital return is contractual, not dependent on exit or sale |
| Forced sale right | If redemption not met, investors can force property sale — their preferred is senior to all common equity |
| Step-in management | Triggered if financial covenants breached |
| Independent appraisal | Annual, ensuring ongoing LTV monitoring |
| DSCR covenant | Minimum 1.2x coverage ratio maintained through intercompany fee structure |

**For OpCo Investors:**

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| 83% gross margins | Provides substantial buffer against revenue shortfalls |
| ~3% break-even | Only 25 guests/year needed to cover fixed costs |
| 1x liquidation preference | Capital returned before founders participate in distributions |
| Revenue participation priority | 5% off the top of gross revenue; paid before operating expenses |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average protection against down-round financing |
| Information rights | Monthly KPIs, quarterly financials, annual audit |

### 5.8 Regulatory Framing

| Jurisdiction | Framework | Application |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **United States** | **Reg D, Rule 506(c)** | Allows general solicitation to accredited investors; verification required. Suitable for both RE preferred equity and OpCo equity/revenue participation. |
| **United States** | **Reg D, Rule 506(b)** | No general solicitation; up to 35 non-accredited (sophisticated) investors. Lower compliance burden. Suitable if raising from existing networks. |
| **Canada** | **NI 45-106, Accredited Investor Exemption** | Canadian investors qualifying under Section 2.3 of NI 45-106. Requires offering memorandum if relying on OM exemption (Section 2.9). |
| **Mexico** | **Fideicomiso** | Required for restricted-zone property ownership. Established with Mexican bank trustee per Constitutional Article 27. |
| **Cayman Islands** | **Exempted Company** | TE Wellness Holdings is a Cayman Exempted Company with a 20-year tax exemption. No local regulatory filing for securities issued to non-Cayman investors. |
| **Periodic Returns** | RE preferred distributions and revenue participation payments are treated as **returns on investment**, not securities offerings. However, the underlying instrument (preferred equity) is a security requiring proper exemption at issuance. |

**Reg A+ Consideration:** Reg A+ (Tier 2) permits raises up to $75M/year from non-accredited investors but requires SEC qualification and ongoing reporting (Form 1-K, Form 1-SA). This could expand the investor base significantly but adds ~$150K–$250K in legal/compliance costs and 3–6 months for qualification. **Recommendation:** Use Reg D for the initial raise; consider Reg A+ for future rounds or if investor pipeline includes significant non-accredited demand.

### 5.9 Rationale — Why This Structure Is Optimal for Both Sides

**For RE Investors:**
- **Bond-like economics:** 9% cumulative preferred return with hard asset security provides fixed-income-style protection in a real estate wrapper
- **Time-bound commitment:** Mandatory Year 5 redemption means investors get their capital back, not a permanent illiquid position
- **Forced sale backstop:** If anything goes wrong, investors can force sale of a $10–12M asset to recover their capital
- **Independent from operating risk:** Preferred return is paid from intercompany fees; property value persists regardless of operating performance
- **Clear, predictable return profile:** No complex waterfall or promote structure — investors know exactly what they get

**For OpCo Investors:**
- **Exposure to an 83% gross margin business** with 78% base-case IRR and 7.5x MOIC
- **Revenue participation provides early cash returns** — quarterly payments starting Month 6, self-liquidating at 2.0x
- **Preferred equity provides structural protection** — 1x liquidation preference, 10% cumulative preferred
- **Diversified return sources:** cash-on-cash from revenue share + equity upside from preferred position

**For Founders:**
- **Zero permanent RE dilution:** Preferred equity is redeemed at Year 5; founders own the property outright
- **Revenue participation is temporary:** 2.0x cap reached by Year 5; obligation then terminates
- **Permanent OpCo dilution limited to 20–25%:** Well above the 70% control threshold
- **IP and brand completely protected:** Cayman structure places all intangible value outside investor reach
- **Maximum long-term optionality:** Once RE preferred is redeemed and revenue participation self-liquidates, founders control a $147M enterprise with ~75% ownership and zero RE encumbrances

## 6. Strategy 2: Secured Debt with Revenue Participation

### Character

**Maximum founder ownership from day one. Debt replaces equity on the RE side. Operating company funded through minority equity plus revenue-based financing. Founders accept debt service obligations as the explicit trade-off for maximum control.**

---

### 6.1 Overall Structure

**TE Real Estate Holdings, LLC** (Delaware or Cayman) — 100% founder-owned
- No equity investors in the RE vehicle
- Capital raised via private secured notes (promissory notes secured by property)

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- Founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.): 70%
- Investors: up to 30% preferred equity

**Revenue Participation Agreement** (separate from equity)
- Standalone economic right; no equity, no voting

### 6.2 Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Instrument | Amount | Terms |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **RE — Senior Secured Notes** | Promissory notes secured by property | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 | 11% annual; interest-only 24 months; amortizing months 25–60; balloon at Year 5 |
| **OpCo — Preferred Equity** | Class B preferred shares | $2,500,000–$3,000,000 | 30% equity; 10% cumulative preferred return; 1x non-participating liquidation preference |
| **OpCo — Revenue Participation** | Revenue participation agreement | $2,000,000–$2,500,000 | 6% of gross revenue until 2.0x returned |
| **Total** | | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** | |

**How the RE vehicle is capitalized without founder cash:**

The entire $10–12M comes from debt investors as secured notes. Founders contribute zero cash. The RE entity is 100% equity-owned by founders with a debt layer from investors. This is analogous to a traditional real estate mortgage — the property buyer owns 100% of the equity while the lender holds a secured claim against the asset. The key difference: these are private notes (not bank loans), carrying a premium interest rate (11%) to compensate for the early-stage risk profile.

---

### 6.3 Ownership and Control Outcomes

| Vehicle | At Close | At Year 5 (Debt Retired) |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| **RE — Equity** | 100% Founders | 100% Founders |
| **RE — Debt** | $10–12M secured notes (investors) | $0 (retired via balloon payment or refinancing) |
| **RE — Control** | 100% Founders (no LP governance) | 100% Founders |
| **OpCo — Equity** | 70% Founders / 30% Investors | 70% Founders / 30% Investors |
| **OpCo — Revenue Participation** | Investors hold economic right only | Self-liquidates at 2.0x |

This is the **maximum ownership strategy**. Founders hold 100% of RE equity and 70% of OpCo equity from day one. No conversion events, no dilution triggers, no uncertainty.

---

### 6.4 Investor Return Mechanics

#### RE Secured Note Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Interest Rate | 11% annual, fixed |
| Security | First-position lien/mortgage on $10–12M property via fideicomiso |
| LTV at Origination | 83–100% (depending on acquisition price vs. loan amount) |
| Interest-Only Period | Months 1–24 (operating ramp phase) |
| Amortization | Months 25–60 (principal + interest payments) |
| Balloon Payment | Remaining balance due at Month 60 (refinance or cash) |
| Forced Sale | On default, after 90-day cure period |
| Cross-default | Default on RE notes triggers step-in rights on OpCo management fee payments |
| Reporting | Quarterly property financials, annual independent appraisal |

**Illustrative Debt Service (on $11M at 11%):**

| Period | Annual Payment | Type | Cumulative to Investor |
|--------|---------------|------|----------------------|
| Year 1 | $1,210,000 | Interest only | $1,210,000 |
| Year 2 | $1,210,000 | Interest only | $2,420,000 |
| Year 3 | ~$2,800,000 | Principal + interest (amortizing) | $5,220,000 |
| Year 4 | ~$2,800,000 | Principal + interest (amortizing) | $8,020,000 |
| Year 5 | ~$6,500,000 (balloon) | Remaining principal + final interest | $14,520,000 |

Total payments over 5 years: ~$14.5M on $11M invested. Effective yield: 11% annual (contractual).

**Debt Service Source:** The RE entity receives intercompany management and lease fees from the OpCo (TE Wellness Holdings → TE Ops Mexico → TE RE Holdings) structured at arm's length. Year 1 operating cash flow of $3.2M (see Section 4.3) comfortably covers $1.21M in interest-only payments. By Year 3, operating cash flow of $11.1M covers the ~$2.8M amortizing payment with substantial margin.

> **Source:** Google Sheets — Cash Flow tab

**Balloon Payment Strategy:** The Year 5 balloon (~$6.5M remaining principal) can be funded from:
1. **Retained cash** — cumulative free cash flow exceeds $41M by Year 5
2. **Conventional bank refinancing** — at Year 5, the property will have appreciated and the business will have a 3+ year operating track record, qualifying for traditional bank financing at 5–7% rates
3. **Combination** — partial cash paydown + refinance of balance

#### OpCo Preferred Equity Returns

Same structure as Strategy 1:

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Preferred Return | 10% cumulative, compounding annually |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In all future equity rounds |
| Board Observer | One seat for lead investor |
| Tag-along Rights | On any founder share transfer |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average, broad-based |

#### OpCo Revenue Participation Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Revenue Share | 6% of gross TE Wellness Holdings revenue, paid quarterly |
| Payment Commencement | Month 6 (post-launch) |
| Return Cap | Payments continue until investor receives 2.0x capital invested |
| Equity Dilution | None |
| Governance Rights | None |
| Founder Redemption | At any time for remaining balance |

**Illustrative Revenue Participation (on $2.25M investment at 6% of revenue):**

| Year | Gross Revenue | 6% Share | Cumulative |
|------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Year 1 (6 months) | $5,150,000 | $309,000 | $309,000 |
| Year 2 | $19,600,000 | $1,176,000 | $1,485,000 |
| Year 3 | $26,300,000 | $1,578,000 | $3,063,000 |
| Year 4 | $30,500,000 | $1,437,000 | $4,500,000 (2.0x cap reached) |

At 6% of revenue, a $2.25M investment returns $4.5M (2.0x) during Year 4. The obligation terminates approximately 3.5–4 years from launch.

---

### 6.5 Founder Advantage and Control Protections

- **100% equity ownership** of the RE entity — debt creates no ownership dilution at any point
- **70% equity and voting control** of TE Wellness Holdings
- **No LP governance rights** on RE — secured noteholders are creditors, not owners
- **Full management authority** over both vehicles — no investor approval required for operating decisions
- **IP permanently held** in TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman)
- At Year 5, if debt is retired, founders own the property **outright** with zero investor claims
- Revenue participation is purely economic — **no governance, no equity, no board rights**
- Debt service obligation is the **explicit, bounded trade-off** for maximum ownership — unlike equity, it has a defined end date

---

### 6.6 Buy-Back / Redemption Mechanics

| Event | RE Vehicle | OpCo Vehicle |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Debt Maturity** | Year 5 — balloon payment of remaining principal + final interest | N/A (permanent equity) |
| **Early Paydown** | Permitted at any time, no prepayment penalty after Month 24 | N/A |
| **Revenue Participation Buy-Out** | N/A | At any time: remaining 2.0x balance minus payments made |
| **OpCo Equity Buy-Back** | N/A | Optional: founders may repurchase up to 5% equity per year at FMV after Year 3 |
| **Refinancing** | Founders may refinance secured notes at any time with conventional bank debt at lower rates | N/A |
| **Default Remedies** | 90-day cure period → forced sale right. Investors recover principal + accrued interest from sale proceeds (senior to all equity) | N/A |

---

### 6.7 Risk Mitigation and Downside Protection

**For RE Debt Investors:**

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Hard asset security | First-position lien on $10–12M property |
| Fixed contractual return | 11% annual interest — not dependent on occupancy, revenue, or exit |
| Priority claim | Debt is senior to all equity; in liquidation, noteholders are paid first |
| Forced sale right | On default, investors can force sale of property |
| Annual appraisal | Monitors LTV ratio annually |
| Cross-default provision | RE default triggers step-in rights on intercompany fee flows |

**Key risk for debt investors:** This strategy has higher LTV (83–100% at origination) than Strategy 1 because the entire acquisition cost is debt-funded. Mitigation: Tulum real estate appreciation of 8–12% annually reduces LTV below 80% within the first year; intercompany fee structure funded by $3.2M+ Y1 cash flow provides comfortable debt service coverage.

**For OpCo Investors:**

Same protections as Strategy 1 — 83% gross margins, ~3% break-even, 1x liquidation preference, anti-dilution, revenue participation priority.

---

### 6.8 Regulatory Framing

| Jurisdiction | Framework | Application |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **United States** | **Reg D, Rule 506(c)** | Secured notes are securities; require Reg D exemption. Revenue participation agreements are also securities. Both accommodated under a single 506(c) filing. |
| **United States** | **Note: Loan vs. Security** | Private secured notes collateralized by real property may qualify as commercial loans rather than securities under the Reves v. Ernst & Young test, depending on structuring. If structured as loans, no Reg D required for the RE tranche. Requires securities counsel opinion. |
| **Canada** | **NI 45-106** | Canadian investors: Accredited Investor Exemption (Section 2.3) or Offering Memorandum Exemption (Section 2.9). Debt instruments may have simpler compliance pathway. |
| **Mexico** | **Fideicomiso** | Bank trust for restricted-zone property. Mortgage lien registered within the fideicomiso structure. |
| **Cayman Islands** | **Exempted Company** | TE Wellness Holdings equity issuance to non-Cayman investors. No local regulatory filing required. |

**Note on RE Debt vs. Securities Classification:** If the RE secured notes can be structured as commercial real estate loans (not securities) — evidenced by mortgage collateral, fixed interest, no profit participation, no convertibility — this could eliminate the need for a Reg D exemption on the RE tranche entirely, simplifying the offering and potentially expanding the investor base to include non-accredited lenders. This requires a formal securities counsel opinion.

---

### 6.9 Rationale — Why This Structure Is Optimal for Both Sides

**For RE Debt Investors:**
- **Fixed income with hard asset backing** — 11% yield in a secured position is attractive to credit-oriented family offices and private lenders
- **Predictable cash flow** — interest payments are contractual, not dependent on business performance
- **Short duration** — 5-year maturity with amortization reduces outstanding principal over time
- **No operating risk** — investors are creditors with collateral, not equity holders exposed to business downside
- **Simple, familiar structure** — a secured loan against real property is the oldest and most understood investment instrument

**For OpCo Investors:**
- **Pure operating exposure** — investors buy into the business, not the real estate
- **Revenue participation provides early cash-on-cash** — quarterly payments from Month 6
- **30% equity in a high-growth business** — 78% base-case IRR, 7.5x MOIC (on total project basis)

**For Founders:**
- **Maximum ownership from day one** — 100% RE + 70% OpCo
- **Debt is finite** — unlike equity, the obligation ends. Once retired, founders own everything
- **No governance concessions on RE** — debt holders are creditors, not partners
- **Refinancing optionality** — as the property appreciates and the business matures, founders can refinance at lower conventional rates (5–7%), dramatically reducing carrying cost
- **Clear path to unencumbered ownership** — at Year 5, with debt retired and revenue participation self-liquidated, founders control a ~$147M enterprise with 70–100% ownership across all vehicles

## 7. Strategy 3: Real Estate Fund with Convertible Operating Capital

### Character

**Institutional fund structure for real estate. Milestone-driven conversion for operating capital. Maximum time to prove the model before committing to permanent dilution. Appeals to sophisticated investors who want downside protection with upside optionality.**

---

### 7.1 Overall Structure

**TE Real Estate Fund, LP** (Cayman Islands)
- Structured as a closed-end limited partnership (fund)
- General Partner: TE RE GP LLC (100% founder-controlled via Panamanian Holdings S.A.)
- Limited Partners: RE investors
- GP contribution: 1–2% (can be funded from management fee offsets)
- LP contribution: 98–99%
- Property held via Mexican S.A. de C.V. subsidiary + fideicomiso

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- Pre-conversion: 100% founder ownership (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.)
- Post-conversion (if notes convert): ≥70% founders / up to 30% investors
- Convertible notes + optional direct equity tranche

### 7.2 Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Instrument | Amount | Terms |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **RE — Fund LP Units** | Limited partnership interests | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 | Institutional waterfall; 8% preferred return; 80/20 split above hurdle; optional LP redemption at Year 5 |
| **OpCo — Convertible Notes** | Convertible secured notes | $3,000,000–$4,000,000 | 8% interest (accruing); auto-convert at Month 24 at $15M valuation cap into up to 25% equity; or repay at 1.5x |
| **OpCo — Direct Equity** | Class B preferred shares | $1,000,000–$1,500,000 | 15–20% equity; 12% cumulative preferred return; 1x non-participating liquidation preference |
| **Total** | | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** | |

**How the RE vehicle is capitalized without founder cash:**

The fund structure is specifically designed for this. In a standard real estate fund, the General Partner contributes 1–2% of total capital and the Limited Partners contribute 98–99%. The GP earns a management fee (typically 1.5–2% of committed capital annually) and a carried interest (typically 20% of profits above the hurdle rate). The GP's 1–2% commitment can be offset against management fees, meaning zero out-of-pocket cash from founders.

This is the most institutionally recognized format for real estate investment and is immediately familiar to family offices, PE funds, and real estate allocators.

---

### 7.3 Ownership and Control Outcomes

| Vehicle | At Close | At Year 5 | After Full LP Redemption |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **RE Fund — GP Interest** | 1–2% economic + 100% management control | Same | 100% (if LPs redeemed) |
| **RE Fund — LP Interest** | 98–99% economic, no management control | Optional redemption at FMV or NAV | 0% (if redeemed) |
| **OpCo — Pre-Conversion** | 100% Founders | — | — |
| **OpCo — Post-Conversion** | ≥70% Founders / up to 30% Investors | ≥70% Founders / up to 30% Investors | Same |
| **OpCo — If No Conversion** | 80–85% Founders / 15–20% (direct equity only) | Same | Same |

**Pre-conversion optionality:** Until the convertible notes convert at Month 24, founders own 100% of OpCo equity (aside from the small direct equity tranche). This gives founders 24 months to prove the operating model before committing to additional dilution.

---

### 7.4 Investor Return Mechanics

#### RE Fund LP Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Management Fee | 1.5% of committed capital annually (Years 1–5); steps down to 1.0% of invested capital thereafter |
| Preferred Return (Hurdle) | 8% cumulative, compounding annually |
| Carried Interest | 20% of profits above the 8% hurdle (GP promote) |
| GP Catch-up | 100% to GP until GP has received 20% of total distributions |
| Residual Split | 80% LP / 20% GP |
| Security | LPs have beneficial interest in fund assets, including the property |
| LP Redemption Option | At Year 5, LPs may request redemption at NAV (Net Asset Value) based on independent appraisal |
| Forced Liquidation | If NAV redemption not funded within 12 months, LPs may vote (>50%) to force fund liquidation |
| Lock-up Period | 5 years (no redemption before Year 5) |
| Reporting | Quarterly NAV updates, quarterly financials, annual audit, annual appraisal |

**Distribution Waterfall:**

| Tier | Distribution |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Return of Capital | 100% to LPs until invested capital returned |
| 2. Preferred Return | 100% to LPs until 8% cumulative preferred satisfied |
| 3. GP Catch-up | 100% to GP until GP has received 20% of total distributions |
| 4. Residual Split | 80% LP / 20% GP |

**Illustrative Fund Economics (on $11M fund at 8% pref, Year 5 NAV of $16M):**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Total LP Capital | $11,000,000 |
| Year 5 Property NAV | $16,000,000 |
| Cumulative Distributions (from intercompany fees) | $4,000,000 |
| Total Value to LPs | Return of capital ($11M) + preferred ($4.4M) = $15.4M |
| Total Value to GP | Catch-up + residual split on remaining = ~$4.6M |
| LP MOIC | ~1.4x on original capital |
| LP IRR | ~12–15% (depending on distribution timing) |

**LP Redemption at Year 5:** LPs can request redemption at NAV based on independent appraisal. If the property has appreciated (Tulum market averaging 8–12% annual appreciation), the NAV at Year 5 would be $16–18M on an $11M acquisition. The GP/fund either:
1. Purchases LP interests from retained cash
2. Refinances the property to fund redemption
3. Brings in replacement LPs at current NAV
4. If none of the above, LPs may vote to force liquidation

#### OpCo Convertible Note Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Interest Rate | 8% annual, accruing (not paid current) |
| Security | Second-priority interest in TE Wellness Holdings assets (after operating obligations) |
| Auto-Conversion | At Month 24 into preferred equity at $15M valuation cap |
| Conversion Cap | Ensures investors receive favorable entry if enterprise value exceeds $15M at conversion |
| Maximum Conversion Equity | Up to 25% of TE Wellness Holdings |
| Founder Buy-Back Option | Founders may repay notes at 1.5x within first 36 months to prevent conversion |
| Maturity (if no conversion) | Balloon repayment at Month 60 at 1.5x principal |

**Illustrative Conversion Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Outcome for Investors | Outcome for Founders |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Enterprise value at Month 24 is $30M (base case trajectory) | Notes convert at $15M cap — investors receive ~25% equity at 50% discount to market | Founders diluted to ~75% (still above 70% minimum) but investors are committed long-term partners |
| Founders exercise buy-back at Month 30 | Notes repaid at 1.5x ($4.5–6M on $3–4M) — investors earn 50% return in 2.5 years | Founders retain 100% of OpCo (minus direct equity tranche); higher cash outflow but zero additional dilution |
| Enterprise underperforms; value at Month 24 is $12M | Notes convert at actual valuation ($12M) — investors receive ~25% equity at par | Founders diluted to ~75% with lower enterprise value, but operating business continues |
| No conversion, no buy-back | Balloon repayment at Month 60 at 1.5x — investors earn 50% over 5 years | Founders retain 100% OpCo equity (minus direct tranche) but must fund $4.5–6M balloon |

#### OpCo Direct Equity Returns

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Equity Position | 15–20% of TE Wellness Holdings |
| Preferred Return | 12% cumulative (premium for smaller tranche committed at the earliest stage) |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In all future equity rounds |
| Tag-along Rights | Standard |
| Board Observer | One seat |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average, broad-based |

---

### 7.5 Founder Advantage and Control Protections

- **GP of the RE Fund** with full management authority — GP controls all property decisions, LP has no vote on operations
- **GP economics:** 1.5% management fee + 20% carried interest — founders earn management income from day one regardless of property performance
- **Pre-conversion ownership of OpCo:** 100% for the first 24 months (minus small direct equity tranche), giving founders time to prove the model before dilution occurs
- **Buy-back option on convertible notes:** If the business performs well, founders can repay at 1.5x and prevent conversion — retaining up to ~85% of OpCo
- **Post-conversion floor:** Even if all notes convert AND direct equity is at maximum, founders retain ≥70% of OpCo
- **IP permanently held** in TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — outside the RE Fund
- **LP has no management authority** — standard fund governance gives GP unilateral control over property decisions, capital calls, distributions, and operational matters
- **LP redemption is optional and at GP's facilitation** — GP controls the process and timeline of any LP exit

---

### 7.6 Buy-Back / Redemption Mechanics

| Event | RE Fund | OpCo |
|-------|---------|------|
| **LP Redemption** | Optional at Year 5 at NAV; GP facilitates through cash, refinancing, or replacement LPs | N/A |
| **Fund Liquidation** | LP vote (>50%) can force after Year 5 if NAV redemption not funded within 12 months | N/A |
| **Convertible Note Buy-Back** | N/A | Founders may repay at 1.5x within first 36 months |
| **Convertible Note Maturity** | N/A | If not converted by Month 24, balloon repayment at Month 60 at 1.5x |
| **Direct Equity Buy-Back** | N/A | Optional: founders may repurchase up to 5% per year at FMV after Year 3 |
| **GP Interest Redemption** | GP interest is not redeemable — founders retain GP permanently | N/A |

**LP Redemption Pricing:**
- Based on **independent third-party appraisal** of the property at Year 5
- NAV = Appraised property value minus any fund-level liabilities
- If appraised value exceeds LP capital + accrued preferred, excess value accrues to GP through the waterfall (carried interest)
- If appraised value is below LP capital + accrued preferred, LPs bear the loss (equity risk) — but Tulum real estate appreciation trends (8–12% annually) make this scenario unlikely

---

### 7.7 Risk Mitigation and Downside Protection

**For RE Fund LP Investors:**

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Hard asset backing | LP interests represent beneficial ownership of $10–12M real property |
| Preferred return | 8% cumulative hurdle before GP participates in any profits |
| Independent NAV | Annual third-party appraisal ensures transparent valuation |
| Liquidation right | LP majority vote can force fund liquidation after Year 5 |
| Institutional governance | Fund structure with independent auditor, annual reporting, quarterly NAV updates |
| Tulum market dynamics | Tulum real estate appreciation 8–12% annually; restricted-zone fideicomiso adds scarcity premium |

**For OpCo Investors:**

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Convertible downside protection | 8% accruing interest provides return floor even if business underperforms |

### 7.8 Regulatory Framing

| Jurisdiction | Framework | Application |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **United States** | **Reg D, Rule 506(c)** | Fund LP interests and OpCo convertible notes/equity are all securities. Single 506(c) filing covers all instruments. |
| **United States** | **Investment Company Act** | The RE Fund must be structured to qualify for an exemption from registration as an investment company under Section 3(c)(1) (up to 100 investors) or Section 3(c)(7) (qualified purchasers only). Most real estate funds rely on 3(c)(1). |
| **Canada** | **NI 45-106** | Accredited Investor Exemption or Offering Memorandum Exemption for Canadian LPs. Convertible notes may have separate Canadian securities treatment. |
| **Cayman Islands** | **Exempted Limited Partnership** | TE Real Estate Fund, LP registered as a Cayman Exempted Limited Partnership. Standard vehicle for international real estate investment. No Cayman income tax, capital gains tax, or withholding tax. |
| **Cayman Islands** | **SIBL Registration** | If the fund has more than 15 investors, it may require registration under the Securities Investment Business Law (SIBL). Alternatively, structure as a "closed-end fund" exempt from CIMA registration if not redeemable. |
| **Mexico** | **Fideicomiso** | Property held via bank trust within the fund's Mexican S.A. de C.V. subsidiary. |

**Fund vs. SPV Consideration:** A fund structure (LP) offers several advantages over a simple SPV:
1. **Familiar to institutional investors** — family offices, PE funds, and real estate allocators invest primarily through LP fund structures
2. **Built-in governance** — LP agreements have decades of established precedent for investor protections, reporting, and exits
3. **Management fee economics** — GP earns 1.5% of committed capital annually (~$165K/year on $11M), providing operating income from day one
4. **Carried interest** — 20% promote above the hurdle rate aligns GP and LP incentives
5. **Expandable** — if additional properties are acquired, they can be added to the fund without creating new entities

---

### 7.9 Rationale — Why This Structure Is Optimal for Both Sides

**For RE Fund LP Investors:**
- **Institutional fund governance** — quarterly NAV, independent audit, annual appraisal, standard LP protections
- **Diversified return profile** — 8% preferred return + property appreciation + share of fund profits above hurdle
- **Redemption optionality** — at Year 5, LPs can request redemption at appraised NAV or hold for continued returns
- **Liquidation backstop** — LP majority vote can force fund liquidation if GP does not facilitate redemption
- **Familiar format** — LP fund structures are the standard for real estate investment; no explanation required for sophisticated investors

**For OpCo Investors:**
- **Downside protection** — 8% accruing interest + 1.5x maturity/buy-back floor provide minimum returns regardless of operating performance
- **Upside optionality** — conversion at $15M cap into a business projected at $147M Y5 enterprise value represents enormous upside potential
- **Multiple exit paths** — conversion to equity, buy-back at 1.5x, or maturity repayment
- **Milestone-driven** — conversion occurs only after 24 months of operating data, reducing blind-pool risk

**For Founders:**
- **GP control is absolute** — LP has no management vote; GP controls all property decisions, capital calls, distributions
- **Management fee income from day one** — 1.5% of $11M = $165K/year regardless of operating performance
- **Carried interest** — 20% of profits above 8% hurdle; at a Year 5 NAV of $16M on $11M invested, GP carry is substantial
- **24 months to prove OpCo** before convertible dilution occurs — maximum time to build leverage
- **Buy-back option prevents dilution** — if cash flow permits, founders can repay at 1.5x and keep ~85% of OpCo
- **Fund structure enables expansion** — additional properties can be acquired into the same fund, increasing AUM, management fees, and carried interest without new entity formation

## 9. Valuation Defense Framework

The prompt asks: **Is there a defensible framework to justify a $10M+ pre-money valuation for the Operating Company?**

### 9.1 The Short Answer

Yes. Multiple independent methodologies support an OpCo pre-money valuation well above $10M.

### 9.2 Nine-Method IPEV-Compliant Valuation

The comprehensive Valuation Report applies nine independent methods to arrive at a **weighted average post-money valuation of $29.35M** for the total enterprise.

| # | Method | Valuation | Weight |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Scorecard Method | $16,000,000 | 20% |
| 2 | Checklist Method | $21,000,000 | 20% |
| 3 | Cost Approach | $24,000,000 | 5% |
| 4 | Tiered Revenue VC | $42,000,000 | 10% |
| 5 | Simple VC (Revenue) | $30,000,000 | 7% |
| 6 | Simple VC (EBITDA) | $33,000,000 | 5% |
| 7 | Simple VC (Net Income) | $30,000,000 | 3% |
| 8 | DCF Growth-Adjusted | $32,000,000 | 20% |
| 9 | DCF with Multiples | $55,000,000 | 10% |
| | **WEIGHTED AVERAGE** | | **$29,350,000** |

> **Source:** `docs/data-room/financial/22-valuation-report.md` — Section 4

### 9.3 OpCo-Specific Valuation (Excluding RE)

If we separate the real estate component (~$11.9M property value) from the total enterprise valuation:

| Approach | Total Enterprise | Less: RE Asset Value | OpCo Implied Value |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 9-Method Weighted Average | $29,350,000 | ($11,900,000) | **$17,450,000** |
| Cost Approach (intangibles only) | $4,000,000 + $2,250,000 (tech IP premium) | — | **$6,250,000** (floor) |
| DCF Growth-Adjusted (total) | $32,000,000 | ($11,900,000) | **$20,100,000** |

The OpCo alone supports a pre-money valuation of **$17–20M** under standard methodologies, well above the $10M threshold.

### 9.4 Comparable Multiples

Addiction/behavioral health treatment center valuations provide relevant comparables:

| Revenue Range | EBITDA Multiple | Application to TE |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| < $1M | 2.75x–3.75x | Not applicable (TE projects $10.3M Y1) |
| $1M–$3M | 3.50x–4.50x | Not applicable |
| $3M–$5M | 4.00x–5.20x | Not applicable |
| $5M–$10M | 5.00x–5.75x | Year 1 range |
| > $10M | 5.50x–6.00x | Year 2+ range |
| Platform (multi-site) | 8x–16x | Future potential |

At a 5.5x EBITDA multiple on Year 1 EBITDA of $4.3M, the healing center alone supports an implied value of **$23.7M** — and this is before accounting for the villa program, property management, or technology platform.

> **Source:** `docs/data-room/financial/22-valuation-report.md` — Section 6.5

### 9.5 IP Separation as a Valuation Multiplier

The separation of IP into TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) and the licensing of that IP to the OpCo creates a structural premium:

1. **The IP is independently valuable** — estimated at $19–42M by Year 5, held in a tax-exempt jurisdiction
2. **Licensing creates recurring, high-margin revenue** — 3–5% royalty on clinical operations + SaaS fees generate $1.3–2.4M per location annually at maturity
3. **Platform optionality** — the IP can be licensed to multiple locations, creating a platform model that commands 8–16x EBITDA multiples
4. **Data monetization** — anonymized outcome database has independent value for pharma, academic, and insurance research partnerships

The IP structure effectively transforms TE from a single-location operating business (5.5x EBITDA) into an IP-licensing platform with technology scale economics (8–16x EBITDA), dramatically increasing enterprise value.

> **Source:** `docs/strategy/TECHNOLOGY_IP_OFFSHORE_STRATEGY.md` — Sections 3, 8, 10

### 9.6 Structural Protections That Make Valuation Less Critical

If investors are concerned about the pre-money valuation, the following structural protections reduce the importance of getting the exact number right:

| Protection | How It Helps |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Preferred return** | Investors receive 8–12% cumulative preferred before founders participate — ensures minimum return regardless of exit valuation |
| **Liquidation preference** | 1x non-participating means investors get their capital back first — downside is protected |
| **Anti-dilution** | Weighted average protection means if a future round occurs at a lower valuation, existing investors' effective price adjusts downward |
| **Convertible cap** | Strategy 3's $15M cap means investors buy in at a known maximum price — if the business is worth more, they got a discount; if less, they convert at actual value |
| **Revenue participation** | Strategies 1 and 2 include a revenue share that returns capital independently of any valuation exercise |

## 10. Regulatory Pathway Analysis

### 10.1 United States — Securities Exemptions

| Exemption | Reg D 506(b) | Reg D 506(c) | Reg A+ (Tier 2) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Investor type** | Up to 35 non-accredited (sophisticated) + unlimited accredited | Accredited only | Non-accredited + accredited |
| **General solicitation** | Prohibited | Permitted | Permitted |
| **Maximum raise** | Unlimited | Unlimited | $75M/12 months |
| **SEC filing** | Form D (15 days post-first sale) | Form D (15 days post-first sale) | Offering Circular filed with SEC; qualification required |
| **Verification** | Self-certification allowed | Must verify accredited status (tax returns, CPA letter, broker letter) | Investor limits (10% of income/net worth for non-accredited) |
| **Ongoing reporting** | None | None | Annual (Form 1-K), Semi-annual (Form 1-SA), Current (Form 1-U) |
| **Estimated cost** | $30K–$60K legal | $40K–$80K legal | $150K–$250K legal + audit |
| **Time to market** | 4–6 weeks | 4–6 weeks | 3–6 months |
| **Recommendation** | Suitable for raising from existing networks | **Recommended for primary raise** | Consider for future rounds or if non-accredited demand is significant |

> **Source:** `docs/data-room/investment/03-private-placement-memorandum.md`

### 10.2 Canada — Securities Exemptions

| Exemption | Accredited Investor (NI 45-106 s.2.3) | Offering Memorandum (NI 45-106 s.2.9) |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Investor type** | Accredited investors only (individuals: $1M+ financial assets or $200K+ income) | Any investor (with investment limits for non-accredited) |
| **Maximum raise** | Unlimited | Unlimited (but OM must be filed) |
| **Documentation** | Subscription agreement + signed risk acknowledgment | Offering Memorandum (similar to US PPM) |
| **Ongoing reporting** | Annual financial statements to investors | Annual financial statements to investors + securities commission |
| **Estimated cost** | $15K–$30K legal | $40K–$80K legal |
| **Recommendation** | **Recommended for Canadian accredited investors** | Use if raising from non-accredited Canadian investors |

### 10.3 Offshore / Fund Structures

| Jurisdiction | Vehicle | Application |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Cayman Islands** | Exempted Limited Partnership | Strategy 3 RE Fund — standard for international real estate funds; no income tax, capital gains tax, or withholding tax; 20-year tax exemption |
| **Cayman Islands** | Exempted Company | TE Wellness Holdings — existing vehicle for OpCo investment |
| **British Virgin Islands** | BVI Business Company | Alternative RE fund domicile — simpler compliance, lower cost; but less institutional cachet than Cayman |
| **Mexico** | Fideicomiso (Bank Trust) | Required for all strategies — restricted-zone property ownership; 50-year renewable; established with Mexican bank |
| **Panama** | Private Interest Foundation | Asset protection for founder equity — not an investment vehicle; holds founder interests in all operating entities |

### 10.4 Cross-Border Considerations

| Issue | Treatment |
|-------|----------|
| **US investors in Cayman fund** | Standard — US accredited investors commonly invest in Cayman LP funds. Tax reporting via Schedule K-1. Fund must ensure compliance with FATCA. |
| **Canadian investors in Cayman fund** | Permitted — Canadian investors must report foreign property holdings (Form T1135 if >C$100K). Fund may be a Controlled Foreign Affiliate under Canadian tax rules; requires tax counsel review. |
| **Mexico withholding on intercompany fees** | Management fees and royalties paid from Mexican entities to Cayman/Panama are subject to Mexican withholding tax (typically 25% on management fees, 25–35% on royalties). Mexico-US treaty may reduce to 15%; no Mexico-Cayman treaty. Requires transfer pricing documentation. |
| **Periodic returns to investors** | Interest payments (Strategy 2), preferred return distributions (Strategies 1, 3), and revenue participation payments (Strategies 1, 2) are treated as returns on investment, not new securities offerings — provided the underlying instrument was properly issued under an exemption at issuance. |
