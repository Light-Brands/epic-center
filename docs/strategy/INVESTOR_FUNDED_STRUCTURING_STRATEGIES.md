> **CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE**: This document contains proprietary and confidential information regarding the proposed investment structure of Transformational Epicenter. Distribution is limited to authorized founders, legal counsel, and approved prospective investors. Recipients agree to maintain strict confidentiality and to return or destroy all copies upon request.

> **SECURITIES DISCLAIMER**: This document does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Any such offer will be made only by means of a formal offering document complying with applicable securities laws (including, where applicable, Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended). All figures, structures, and terms are illustrative and subject to legal counsel review, regulatory compliance, and final negotiation. Recipients should consult their own legal, tax, and financial advisors.

> **FOUNDER CONTRIBUTION MODEL**: The strategies in this document are structured such that **founders contribute zero cash capital**. All investment capital — for both real estate acquisition and operating company funding — is sourced from investors. Founders contribute intellectual property, brand, vision, proprietary protocols, technology, and ongoing management and execution in exchange for majority ownership and long-term control. This model is well-established in venture capital, fund management, and franchise structures where the operator's contribution is expertise, IP, and sweat equity rather than financial capital.

## 1. Architecture Foundation

All three investment strategies are built on the existing seven-entity global architecture spanning five jurisdictions, with the addition of a dedicated real estate vehicle. The critical structural principle: **founders' IP, brand, AI, data, and core protocols are held outside any investor-accessible entity.** The operating company licenses IP from the holdings entity — it does not own it.

### The Seven-Entity Ecosystem

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Role | Tax Rate |
|--------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Panama PIF** | Panama | Ultimate asset protection; holds 100% of Panamanian Holdings S.A. | 0% |
| **Panamanian Holdings S.A.** | Panama | Intermediate holdco; holds ~70% of TE Holdings + 100% of Studio + 100% of CI IBC | 0% (territorial) |
| **TE Wellness Holdings** | Cayman Islands | Owns all TE IP; collects all TE revenue; controls Mexico OpCo; investable vehicle | 0% (unconditional) |
| **Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC** | Dubai, UAE | Shared service center; builds all technology; employs team | 0% (QFZP) |
| **Light Brands Consulting Ltd** | Cook Islands | External consulting and SaaS; owns LB-specific IP; zero employees | 0% |
| **TE Ops Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.** | Tulum, Mexico | Operates healing facility; employs local staff; delivers guest experience | 30% on margin |
| **Church of the Living Light** | United States | Spiritual mission; dual royalty streams; employs founders as ministers | 0% (exempt) |

### Ownership Chain

```
Panama PIF (independent legal person)
  └── 100% → Panamanian Holdings S.A. (intermediate holdco)
                ├── ~70% → TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — investable vehicle
                │             └── 100% → TE Ops Mexico (operations)
                ├── 100% → Light Brands Studio (Dubai) — service center
                └── 100% → Light Brands Consulting (Cook Islands) — external revenue

Church of the Living Light — independent nonprofit, no owner
```

### The Dedicated Real Estate Vehicle: TE Real Estate Holdings

Each strategy introduces a **dedicated real estate entity** to hold the Tulum property, structurally separating the real estate investment from the operating company. The legal form and jurisdiction of this entity vary by strategy (LP, LLC, or direct holding), but in all cases:

- The property is held via a Mexican S.A. de C.V. subsidiary with a **fideicomiso** (bank trust) for restricted-zone compliance
- Real estate assets are isolated from operating company liabilities
- IP and brand value remain in TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman), **outside the RE vehicle entirely**
- The OpCo **licenses** IP from Holdings — it does not own it

### Critical Structural Principle: IP Separation

The operating company's value is built on licensed IP. The IP itself — technology platform, AI models, clinical protocols, anonymized outcome database, brand, trademarks — is owned by TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) and is **never** placed in any investor-accessible entity, never collateralized, and never assigned to the RE vehicle. This separation is foundational to the valuation framework (Section 3) and the control framework (Section 8).

## 2. Base Assumptions

The following assumptions are shared across all three strategies and are derived from the financial model and negotiated acquisition terms.

### Capital Requirements

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Property Acquisition (negotiated) | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 |
| Operating Capital (working capital, renovation, medical, technology, pre-opening, contingency) | ~$5,000,000 |
| **Total Capital Raise** | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** |

### Founder Contribution: Zero Cash Capital

**Founders contribute $0 in cash capital across all strategies.** 100% of investment capital is sourced from investors.

Founders contribute:

- **Intellectual property** — AI personalization engine, pharmacogenomic dosing platform, clinical protocol library, 14-system integrated technology platform, anonymized outcome database, brain mapping algorithms (estimated Year 5 value: $19–42M)
- **Brand and trademarks** — Transformational Epicenter brand, positioning, market presence
- **Vision and strategy** — Business model design, market selection, competitive positioning
- **Protocols and methodology** — Proprietary healing protocols, screening tools, training certifications
- **Management and execution** — Day-to-day operations, team building, guest experience delivery, investor relations

This model is structurally analogous to:
- **GP/LP fund structures** where the general partner contributes management expertise, not capital, and earns carried interest
- **Franchise models** where the franchisor contributes brand, systems, and know-how
- **Venture-backed companies** where founders contribute IP, product, and execution while investors contribute capital

### Revenue Projections (Base Case)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | 5-Year Total |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Total Revenue | $10,300,000 | $19,600,000 | $26,300,000 | $30,500,000 | $34,000,000 | $120,700,000 |
| EBITDA | $4,301,800 | $10,902,089 | $15,439,741 | $18,105,249 | $20,299,217 | $69,048,096 |
| EBITDA Margin | 42% | 56% | 59% | 59% | 60% | 57% |
| Net Income | $2,537,260 | $7,052,462 | $10,144,819 | $11,947,674 | $13,420,452 | $45,102,667 |

### Key Operating Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 83% |
| Break-even Occupancy | ~3% |
| Average Revenue Per Guest | $26,600 |
| Year 5 Enterprise Value (base) | $81,200,000 |
| Project IRR with Exit (base) | 78% |
| 5-Year MOIC (base) | 7.5x |
| IP Value Estimate (Year 5) | $19–42M |
| 5-Year Cumulative Net Income | $45,102,667 |
| NPV @ 15% Discount Rate | $13,400,000 |
| IRR (Operating Only, no exit) | 53.6% |

### Non-Negotiable Control Requirements

| Vehicle | Minimum Founder Ownership |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Operating Company (TE Wellness Holdings) | 70% (supermajority control) |
| Real Estate Entity | Flexible: 20–49% investor equity, with buy-back to 100% |

### Key Difference from Prior Structuring Strategies

The prior document (`INVESTMENT_STRUCTURING_STRATEGIES.md`) assumed founders contributed $5.1M–$9.8M in cash capital across strategies, with RE investor ownership fixed at a 49% maximum. This document assumes **$0 founder cash contribution**, introduces flexible RE investor ownership (20–49% with mandatory buy-back mechanics), funds the OpCo via hybrid structures (~$2.5M equity + ~$2.5M debt/convertible/RBF), and adds dedicated sections on regulatory framing, OpCo valuation defense, and buy-back mechanics not present in the prior document.

## 3. Operating Company Valuation Framework

A central question in a zero-cash-in structure is: **"Is there a defensible way to support a $10M+ pre-money valuation for the operating company when founders contribute no cash?"**

The answer is yes, across multiple independent valuation methodologies.

### 3.1 Revenue Multiple Approach

The most direct valuation method for an early-stage operating business with a clear revenue model.

| Metric | Value | Multiple | Implied Valuation |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Year 1 Revenue (projected) | $10,300,000 | 1.0x | $10,300,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue (projected) | $10,300,000 | 1.5x | $15,450,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue (projected) | $10,300,000 | 2.0x | $20,600,000 |

A 1.0–2.0x revenue multiple is **conservative** for a high-margin (83% gross) health and wellness business. Comparable luxury wellness operators and health-tech companies trade at 2–5x revenue. A 1.0x multiple on Year 1 projected revenue alone supports a $10M pre-money valuation.

### 3.2 Discounted Cash Flow Approach

NPV of projected free cash flows at various discount rates:

| Discount Rate | NPV of 5-Year Cash Flows |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| 10% | $18,200,000 |
| 12% | $16,100,000 |
| 15% | $13,400,000 |
| 20% | $10,800,000 |

Even at an aggressive 20% discount rate, the NPV of operating cash flows exceeds $10M, supporting the pre-money valuation.

### 3.3 Asset-Based Approach: IP Inventory

The OpCo's value is built on licensed IP with independently assessable value:

| IP Asset | Estimated Year 5 Value | Licensing Revenue Potential |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| AI Personalization Engine | $3–5M | Licensing to all locations + third parties |
| Pharmacogenomic Dosing Platform | $2–4M | Per-patient licensing |
| Clinical Protocol Library | $1–3M | Royalties from every location |
| 14-System Integrated Platform | $3–5M (replacement: $7.5M) | SaaS to all locations |
| Anonymized Outcome Database | $5–15M+ (grows annually) | Research licensing to pharma/academia |
| Brain Mapping Analysis Algorithms | $1–3M | Per-scan fees |
| Guest Journey Mobile App | $500K–1M | Per-location SaaS |
| Screening & Risk Assessment Tools | $500K–1M | Per-patient fees |
| Training & Certification Programs | $500K–1M | Per-practitioner licensing |
| Trademarks & Brand | $2–5M | Brand licensing per location |
| **Total IP Value (Year 5)** | **$19–42M** | **$3–8M/year in licensing** |

The IP is owned by TE Wellness Holdings and licensed to the OpCo. The OpCo's access to this IP — and its exclusive license to operate under the brand — is a core driver of its valuation. The IP's independent value ($19–42M at Year 5) far exceeds the $10M pre-money valuation assigned to the OpCo.

### 3.4 IP Licensing Model as Valuation Driver

The structural separation of IP from operations creates two distinct valuation lenses:

- **The IP entity (TE Wellness Holdings)** is valued on its licensing and platform economics — recurring royalty streams, SaaS fees, data licensing revenue
- **The OpCo** is valued on its operating economics — occupancy, ADR, EBITDA margins, guest throughput

These valuations are **additive, not overlapping.** The OpCo's value derives from its ability to generate operating revenue using licensed IP. The IP entity's value derives from the IP itself and its licensing potential across multiple locations and third parties. Together they justify $10M+ for the OpCo alone, because the OpCo is the exclusive operating licensee of IP worth multiples of that figure.

### 3.5 Comparable Transactions

**High-End Wellness Retreats:**

| Comparable | Revenue | Valuation Context |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| The Ranch Malibu | ~$30M+ estimated | Single-location, luxury wellness; no technology platform |
| SHA Wellness Clinic (Spain) | ~$50M+ estimated | Medical wellness resort; multi-location expansion |
| Lanserhof (Austria/Germany) | ~$100M+ enterprise value | European medical wellness leader; 5+ locations |
| Clinique La Prairie (Switzerland) | Acquired at reported $500M+ | Longevity clinic; brand + real estate + IP |

**Health-Tech and Psychedelic Therapy:**

| Comparable | Revenue at Valuation | Valuation | Multiple |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| Compass Pathways (CMPS) | Pre-revenue at IPO | $1.4B market cap (2020 IPO) | N/A (pre-revenue) |
| Atai Life Sciences | Pre-revenue at IPO | $2.3B market cap (2021 IPO) | N/A (pre-revenue) |
| Field Trip Health | ~$5M revenue | $200M+ peak market cap | 40x+ |
| Hims & Hers Health | ~$150M revenue at IPO | $1.6B IPO valuation | ~10x |

TE's $10M pre-money valuation on $10.3M projected Year 1 revenue (1.0x multiple) is conservative relative to these comparables, particularly given the 83% gross margin, proprietary technology platform, and IP licensing model.

### 3.6 Valuation Summary

| Method | Implied Valuation Range | Assessment |
|--------|------------------------|------------|
| Revenue multiple (1.0–2.0x Y1) | $10.3–20.6M | Conservative for high-margin wellness |
| DCF (15–20% discount rate) | $10.8–13.4M | Supported by verified financial model |
| IP asset value (Year 5) | $19–42M | IP alone exceeds OpCo valuation |
| Comparable transactions | $10M+ easily defensible | Pre-revenue psychedelic companies valued at $200M–2.3B |
| **Defensible pre-money valuation** | **$10M+** | **Supported by all four methodologies** |

## 4. Strategy A: Structured Real Estate Fund + Management Equity

### Fund-Style RE Vehicle with Professional GP/LP Structure

**Character:** The most institutional approach. Real estate is acquired through a fund-style LP structure where investors provide 100% of capital and founders serve as GP, earning management control and promoted interest (carried interest) through performance — not through cash contribution. The OpCo is funded via a hybrid of equity and debt instruments. Founders earn ownership through management, IP contribution, and execution — not capital.

### Entity Structure

**TE Real Estate Fund, LP** (Cayman or Delaware)
- General Partner: TE RE GP, LLC — controlled by founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.)
- Limited Partners: Real estate investors providing 100% of fund capital
- GP contributes management expertise and deal sourcing — not cash
- Holds property via Mexican S.A. de C.V. + fideicomiso

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- ~$2.5M raised as equity for 25–30% ownership (implies $8.3–10M pre-money valuation; see Section 3)
- ~$2.5M raised as convertible note or revenue-based financing
- Founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.): 70–75% ownership + full management control

### Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Amount | Instrument | Founder Cash | Investor Cash |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| RE Fund LP — Investor Capital | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 | LP equity interests | $0 | $10–12M |
| OpCo — Equity | ~$2,500,000 | Preferred equity (25–30%) | $0 | $2.5M |
| OpCo — Debt/Convertible | ~$2,500,000 | Convertible note or RBF | $0 | $2.5M |
| **Total** | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** | | **$0** | **$15–17M** |

### Investor Returns — RE Fund LP

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| GP Commitment | $0 cash (GP contributes management, deal sourcing, asset management) |
| Management Fee | 1.5–2.0% of committed capital annually (funds GP operations) |
| Preferred Return | 8–10% cumulative, compounding annually to LPs |
| Carried Interest (Promote) | 20% of profits above preferred return to GP |
| LP Economic Interest | 80% of profits after preferred return (net of carry) |
| LP Ownership (pre-promote) | 100% of capital, but 20–40% effective economic interest after GP promote |
| Security | First-position mortgage/lien on property |
| Forced Sale Rights | Available on default after 90-day cure period |
| Mandatory LP Redemption | At Year 5: founders buy back LP interests (see Buy-Back Mechanics below) |
| Reporting | Quarterly financials, annual audit, annual independent property appraisal |

**Distribution Waterfall:**

| Tier | Distribution |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Return of Capital | 100% to LPs until invested capital returned |
| 2. Preferred Return | 100% to LPs until 8–10% cumulative preferred return satisfied |
| 3. GP Catch-up | 100% to GP until GP has received 20% of total distributions |
| 4. Residual Split | 80% LP / 20% GP |

### Investor Returns — OpCo Equity Tranche (~$2.5M)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Ownership | 25–30% of TE Wellness Holdings |
| Pre-money Valuation | $8.3–10M (see Section 3 for valuation defense) |
| Preferred Return | 10–12% cumulative (higher risk premium for operating business) |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In all future equity rounds |
| Board Observer | One seat for lead investor or investor group |
| Tag-along Rights | On any founder share transfer |
| Information Rights | Monthly KPIs, quarterly financials, annual audit |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average, broad-based |

### Investor Returns — OpCo Debt/Convertible Tranche (~$2.5M)

**Option 1: Convertible Note**
- 8% annual interest (accruing or cash-pay, negotiable)
- 24-month maturity with optional conversion
- Conversion at pre-agreed valuation cap ($10M+)
- If converted: up to 5% additional equity (total investor equity capped at ~30%)
- If not converted: repayment at 1.3x principal

**Option 2: Revenue-Based Financing**
- 5–8% of gross revenue, paid quarterly, commencing Month 6
- Return cap: 2.0x capital invested ($5M total return on $2.5M)
- No equity dilution
- Self-extinguishing upon reaching 2.0x cap
- Founders may accelerate buy-out at any time for remaining balance

### Regulatory Framing

- **RE Fund:** Reg D 506(b) or 506(c) private placement for US investors; Reg S for non-US investors. Alternatively, structure as a Cayman-domiciled fund (standard for international capital) to avoid US securities registration complexity for non-US investors.
- **OpCo Equity:** Same Reg D framework, or Cayman-domiciled offering outside US jurisdiction.
- **OpCo Debt/Convertible:** Convertible notes issued by a Cayman entity to non-US investors may not require US securities registration. For US investors, include in the Reg D offering.

### Buy-Back Mechanics — RE Fund

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Trigger | Mandatory at Year 5 (optional earlier at GP election) |
| Redemption Price | Greater of: (a) original capital + accrued preferred return, or (b) fair market value based on independent appraisal |
| Funding Sources | Operating cash flow, refinancing proceeds, new capital raise, or combination |
| If Founders Cannot Buy Back | LP interests remain outstanding with ongoing preferred return; no forced liquidation unless default |
| Post-Buy-Back | Founders own 100% of RE entity; GP promote obligations extinguish |

**Illustrative Buy-Back Economics (Year 5):**

Assuming $10M LP capital, 8% preferred return, and property appreciation to $14M:

| Scenario | Redemption Price | Founder Outcome |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Buy-back at original + pref | ~$14.7M ($10M + $4.7M accrued pref) | Founders own 100% of $14M+ property |
| Buy-back at FMV | $14M (if FMV < capital + pref, use higher) | Founders own 100% of property |
| No buy-back | LPs retain interests; ongoing 8% pref continues | Founders retain GP control + 20% carry |

### Founder Control Mechanisms

- **GP of RE Fund** with full management authority over property decisions — LPs have no vote on operations
- **70–75% voting control** of TE Wellness Holdings
- **Management fee** (1.5–2.0% of committed capital) funds GP operations independently of fund performance
- **Carried interest** (20% of profits above preferred return) aligns GP and LP incentives
- **IP held in Holdings**, protected by the offshore structure — outside RE entity entirely
- Protective provisions require investor consent only for: sale of entity, new debt above threshold, related-party transactions above threshold, changes to governing documents

### Why This Strategy Is Attractive

**For RE investors:**
- Institutional GP/LP structure — familiar to family offices and institutional allocators
- Real asset backing with first-position lien
- Preferred return with hard collateral security
- Mandatory redemption at Year 5 provides liquidity certainty
- GP promote alignment — founders earn only after LPs receive their preferred return

**For OpCo investors:**
- Exposure to an 83% gross margin operating business at a conservative valuation
- Hybrid structure (equity + debt/convertible) provides both upside and downside protection
- Revenue-based financing option provides early quarterly cash returns
- Clean Cayman structure familiar to institutional investors

**For founders:**
- $0 cash required — founders earn ownership through management, IP, and execution
- GP/LP structure is the most recognized zero-cash-in format in institutional finance
- Management fee provides operating income independent of fund performance
- Buy-back at Year 5 creates a clear path to 100% RE ownership
- IP and brand fully protected in Holdings — never in the RE fund

---

## 5. Strategy B: Secured Debt Property Acquisition + Hybrid OpCo

### Maximum Founder Control from Day One

**Character:** Founders own 100% of the RE entity from inception. All RE capital enters as secured debt — no equity dilution on the property at any point. The OpCo is funded via a hybrid of preferred equity and debt instruments. Founders accept debt service obligations as the trade-off for maximum ownership. The highest-control strategy, suited to investors who prefer fixed-income returns over equity upside.

### Entity Structure

**TE Real Estate Holdings** (founder-controlled, 100% equity from day one)
- No equity investors in the RE vehicle — all capital via private secured notes
- Founders own 100% through Panamanian Holdings S.A.

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- $2.5M preferred equity for 25% ownership (implies $10M pre-money valuation)
- $2.5M as loan or revenue-based financing
- Founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.): 75% ownership + full management control

### Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Amount | Instrument | Founder Cash | Investor Cash |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| RE — Private Secured Notes | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 | Promissory notes secured by property | $0 | $10–12M |
| OpCo — Preferred Equity | ~$2,500,000 | 25% ownership at $10M pre-money | $0 | $2.5M |
| OpCo — Debt/RBF | ~$2,500,000 | Term loan or revenue-based financing | $0 | $2.5M |
| **Total** | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** | | **$0** | **$15–17M** |

### Investor Returns — RE Secured Notes

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Interest Rate | 10–12% annual, fixed |
| Security | First-position lien/mortgage on property (via fideicomiso) |
| Interest-Only Period | Months 1–24 (operating ramp phase) |
| Amortization | Months 25–60 (principal + interest payments) |
| Balloon Payment | Remaining balance due at Month 60 (refinance or exit) |
| Forced Sale | On default, after 90-day cure period |
| LTV at Origination | 83–100% (higher risk than Strategy A — offset by higher yield) |
| Reporting | Quarterly property financials, annual independent appraisal |

**Illustrative Debt Service (on $11M at 11%):**

| Period | Annual Payment | Type |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Year 1 | $1,210,000 | Interest only |
| Year 2 | $1,210,000 | Interest only |
| Year 3 | ~$2,750,000 | Principal + interest (amortizing) |
| Year 4 | ~$2,750,000 | Principal + interest (amortizing) |
| Year 5 | Balloon (~$4,500,000) | Remaining principal |

Debt service is funded from TE Holdings revenue via intercompany management/lease fees from the OpCo to the RE entity, structured at arm's length. Year 1 EBITDA of $4,301,800 provides approximately 3.6x coverage of Year 1 interest-only payments.

### Investor Returns — OpCo Preferred Equity (~$2.5M)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Ownership | 25% of TE Wellness Holdings |
| Pre-money Valuation | $10M (see Section 3 for valuation defense) |
| Preferred Return | 10–12% cumulative |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In all future equity rounds |
| Board Observer | One seat |
| Tag-along Rights | On any founder share transfer |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average, broad-based |

### Investor Returns — OpCo Debt/RBF Tranche (~$2.5M)

Three options (investor selects based on preference):

**Option 1: Term Loan**
- 10–12% annual interest, fixed
- Interest-only for 12 months; amortizing over months 13–60
- No equity dilution
- Secured by OpCo cash flows (subordinate to RE obligations)

**Option 2: Revenue-Based Financing**
- 5–8% of gross revenue, paid quarterly, commencing Month 6
- Return cap: 2.0x capital invested ($5M total return on $2.5M)
- No equity dilution
- Self-extinguishing at 2.0x

**Option 3: Convertible Note**
- 8% annual interest (accruing)
- Optional conversion to equity at pre-agreed valuation cap ($10M+)
- If converted: up to 5% additional equity
- If not converted: repayment at 1.3x at Month 36
- Founder right to force repayment (prevent conversion) at 1.3x at any time

### Regulatory Framing

- **Secured notes:** Reg D 506(b) or 506(c) for US investors. If structured as **loan agreements** (not securities) with a small number of institutional lenders, may not require Reg D compliance depending on jurisdiction, number of lenders, and note terms. Legal counsel to advise on the securities/loan distinction.
- **OpCo equity:** Reg D or Cayman-domiciled offering.
- **Non-US option:** Cayman-domiciled fund/SPV for non-US investors; Canadian exempt distribution under NI 45-106 for Canadian accredited investors.

### Buy-Back Mechanics — RE

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Equity Buy-Back | Not required — founders already own 100% of RE entity from day one |
| Debt Repayment | Balloon at Month 60; founders refinance with traditional bank mortgage or retire from operating cash flow |
| Refinancing Option | Once property has 24+ months of operating history and demonstrated cash flow, founders can refinance at conventional rates (5–7%) and retire the higher-cost secured notes |
| Early Repayment | Permitted after Month 24 with no prepayment penalty (or with a declining premium — negotiable) |

### Founder Control Mechanisms

- **100% equity ownership** of the RE entity from day one — debt creates no ownership dilution
- **75% equity ownership** of TE Wellness Holdings
- Full management control of both entities — no LP approval rights, no investor governance on RE
- Debt service obligation is the explicit trade-off for maintaining maximum ownership
- At Year 5, if debt is retired or refinanced, founders own the property outright with no ongoing investor claims
- IP held in Holdings, outside RE entity — no investor has any claim on IP

### Why This Strategy Is Attractive

**For RE debt investors:**
- Fixed income with real asset security (10–12% yield)
- Predictable cash flow regardless of operating performance
- First-position lien provides strong downside protection
- 10–12% yield is attractive to fixed-income-oriented family offices and credit funds
- No operating risk — return is contractual, not dependent on occupancy

**For OpCo investors:**
- Hybrid structure: equity tranche provides operating upside; debt/RBF tranche provides downside protection
- Revenue-based financing option delivers early quarterly cash returns
- Multiple instrument options accommodate different risk/return preferences

**For founders:**
- Maximum ownership preservation — 100% of RE + 75% of OpCo from day one
- $0 cash required
- Debt is refinanceable — once property has operating history, refinance at conventional rates
- No LP governance overhead on property decisions
- If the business succeeds at projected levels ($4.3M Y1 EBITDA), debt service is manageable from operating cash flow (3.6x DSCR in Year 1 on interest-only payments)

## 6. Strategy C: Phased Convertible Capital with Full Buy-Back Path

### All Capital as Debt or Convertible — Founders Start at 100% Ownership of Everything

**Character:** The most founder-friendly long-term structure. All capital enters as debt or convertible instruments. Founders begin at 100% ownership of both entities. Investors convert to equity only at milestones — and founders can buy them out before or after conversion. Appeals to investors who want milestone-driven deployment with multiple return paths.

### Entity Structure

**TE Real Estate Holdings** (founder-controlled, 100% equity at inception)
- Capital enters via convertible secured notes — no equity at close
- Conversion to LP equity occurs only at Month 30 (or not at all, if founders buy back)

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- Capital enters via revenue-based financing + convertible note — no equity at close
- Equity conversion is optional, milestone-driven, and subject to founder buy-back rights
- Founders: 100% at inception; minimum 75% post-conversion (worst case)

### Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Amount | Instrument | Founder Cash | Investor Cash |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| RE — Convertible Secured Notes | $10,000,000–$12,000,000 | Convertible notes secured by property | $0 | $10–12M |
| OpCo — Revenue-Based Financing | ~$3,000,000 | 5–8% of gross revenue until 2.0x returned | $0 | $3M |
| OpCo — Convertible Note | ~$2,000,000 | 8% interest; optional conversion to equity | $0 | $2M |
| **Total** | **$15,000,000–$17,000,000** | | **$0** | **$15–17M** |

### Investor Returns — RE Convertible Secured Notes

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Interest Rate | 8% annual (accruing, compounding; payable at conversion or maturity) |
| Security | First-position lien/mortgage on property |
| Auto-Conversion Trigger | Month 30 — notes automatically convert into 30–40% LP equity at valuation cap of $14–18M |
| Maximum Conversion | 40% LP equity (founders retain minimum 60%) |
| Founder Buy-Back Option | Founders may repay notes at 1.4x within 36 months to **prevent conversion entirely** |
| Maturity (if no conversion or buy-back) | Balloon repayment at Month 60 at 1.5x principal |
| Reporting | Quarterly financials, annual property appraisal |

**Illustrative Conversion and Buy-Back Scenarios:**

| Event | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| Property appreciates to $16M by Month 30 | Notes convert at $14–18M cap — investors receive 30–40% LP equity at discount to market |
| Founders exercise buy-back at Month 30 | Founders repay 1.4x ($14–16.8M on $10–12M) — investors earn 40% return; founders retain 100% |
| No conversion, no buy-back | Balloon repayment at Month 60 at 1.5x principal — investors earn 50% return over 5 years |
| Notes convert, then founders repurchase LP units at Year 5 | Founders repurchase LP units at FMV via independent appraisal |

### Investor Returns — OpCo Revenue-Based Financing (~$3M)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Revenue Share | 5–8% of gross TE revenue, paid quarterly |
| Payment Commencement | Month 6 (post-launch) |
| Return Cap | Payments continue until investor receives 2.0x capital invested ($6M total) |
| Equity Dilution | None — purely economic participation |
| Founder Redemption | Founders may buy out revenue participation at any time for remaining 2.0x balance minus payments already received |

**Illustrative Revenue Participation Cash Flows (on $3M investment at 6% of revenue):**

| Year | Gross Revenue | 6% Share | Cumulative to Investor |
|------|--------------|----------|----------------------|
| Year 1 (6 months) | $5,150,000 | $309,000 | $309,000 |
| Year 2 | $19,600,000 | $1,176,000 | $1,485,000 |
| Year 3 | $26,300,000 | $1,578,000 | $3,063,000 |
| Year 4 | $30,500,000 | $1,830,000 | $4,893,000 |
| Year 5 | $34,000,000 | $2,040,000 | $6,933,000 |

At 6% of revenue, a $3M investment returns $6M (the 2.0x cap) within approximately 4.5 years. The obligation self-extinguishes. No equity is given.

### Investor Returns — OpCo Convertible Note (~$2M)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Interest Rate | 8% annual (accruing) |
| Maturity | Month 36 |
| Optional Conversion | Investor may convert to up to 25% equity at valuation cap of $10M+ at Month 24 |
| Founder Buy-Back | Founders may repay at 1.3x at any time before conversion to prevent dilution |
| If Converted (worst case) | Founders retain 75% of OpCo |
| Post-Conversion Founder Rights | Standard redemption: founders may repurchase converted equity at FMV after Year 3 |
| Tag-along / Drag-along | Standard provisions if converted to equity |

### Regulatory Framing

- **Convertible notes and revenue participation agreements** may be structured as loan agreements in some jurisdictions, potentially avoiding securities registration requirements. Legal counsel to advise based on instrument terms, number of investors, and jurisdiction.
- **Reg D 506(b)** for US investors (safest approach — treats all instruments as securities).
- **Offshore structuring:** Cayman-issued notes to non-US investors may avoid US securities registration entirely.
- **Reg A+ (Tier 2):** Up to $75M raise, open to non-accredited investors, requires SEC qualification — consider only if a broader retail-style RE raise is desired.

### Buy-Back Mechanics — RE + OpCo

**Real Estate:**

| Trigger | Terms |
|---------|-------|
| Pre-conversion buy-back (within 36 months) | Repay at 1.4x to prevent conversion entirely — founders retain 100% |
| Post-conversion repurchase (after Year 5) | Founders repurchase LP units at FMV based on independent appraisal |
| Funded from | Operating cash flow, refinancing proceeds, new capital, or combination |

**OpCo — Revenue Participation:**

| Trigger | Terms |
|---------|-------|
| Self-extinguishing | Obligation ends when 2.0x cap is reached (~4.5 years) |
| Accelerated buy-out | Founders may pay remaining balance (2.0x minus cumulative payments) at any time |

**OpCo — Convertible Note:**

| Trigger | Terms |
|---------|-------|
| Pre-conversion repayment | Founders repay at 1.3x at any time before Month 24 conversion window |
| Post-conversion redemption | If converted, founders may repurchase equity at FMV after Year 3; standard tag-along rights apply |

### Founder Control Mechanisms

- **Pre-conversion:** 100% ownership of both entities — maximum control during the proving period
- **Post-conversion (worst case):** 60% RE + 75% OpCo — exceeds all non-negotiable minimums
- **Buy-back options** create a clear path to regaining full ownership if cash flow permits
- Revenue participation creates **no governance rights** — purely economic participation
- IP always protected in the offshore structure regardless of conversion outcomes
- Convertible structure gives founders 24–36 months to demonstrate value before any permanent dilution

### Why This Strategy Is Attractive

**For investors:**
- Downside protection via secured notes and revenue participation, **plus** upside optionality through equity conversion
- Milestone-driven: capital converts only after 30 months of operating data
- Revenue participation provides early quarterly cash returns starting Month 6
- Multiple return paths: conversion to equity, buy-back at 1.4x, maturity at 1.5x, or revenue share at 2.0x
- Every instrument has a defined floor return regardless of conversion

**For founders:**
- $0 cash required
- Start at 100% ownership of everything — maximum negotiating leverage
- Buy-back provisions create alignment: if the business succeeds, founders can repurchase at returns attractive to both sides
- Revenue participation is self-extinguishing — no permanent obligation
- Worst-case dilution (60% RE + 75% OpCo) still exceeds all control minimums
- 24–36 months to prove the model before any permanent equity is committed

## 8. IP, Data & Control Framework

### Absolute Rules — Consistent Across All Strategies

Regardless of which investment structure is selected, the intellectual property, brand, AI/data assets, and technology platform are protected by the same offshore architecture. **No investor — in any entity, under any strategy — gains ownership of IP.** Investors gain economic exposure to the revenue generated by IP, not the IP itself.

### IP Ownership Map

| IP Asset | Owner | Location |
|----------|-------|----------|
| AI Personalization Engine | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Pharmacogenomic Dosing Platform | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Clinical Protocol Library | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| 14-System Integrated Technology Platform | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Anonymized Outcome Database | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Brain Mapping Analysis Algorithms | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Guest Journey Mobile App | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Screening & Risk Assessment Tools | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Training & Certification Programs | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| TE Brand and Trademarks | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Light Brands Consulting Frameworks | Light Brands Consulting Ltd | Cook Islands |
| Light Brands SaaS Products | Light Brands Consulting Ltd | Cook Islands |

### How IP Is Protected

**1. All TE IP is owned by TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — never by the RE entity, never by the OpCo directly.**
The RE vehicle holds the physical property only. The Mexico OpCo operates the facility. Technology, brand, data, AI models, protocols, and all intangible assets reside in Holdings, which is a separate Cayman Exempted Company with its own corporate governance and a 20-year tax undertaking.

**2. The OpCo licenses IP — it does not own it.**
TE Ops Mexico operates under a licensing arrangement with TE Wellness Holdings. The OpCo pays arm's-length licensing fees (3–5% of revenue for clinical protocols; $15–30K/month for SaaS platform; 2–3% of revenue for brand license). This creates revenue for Holdings while ensuring IP never transfers to or resides in the OpCo.

**3. No investor has control over IP, brand, AI, data, or core protocols.**
Investors in the RE entity hold interests in real property. Investors in the OpCo hold equity in (or debt claims against) TE Wellness Holdings — but IP is a corporate asset of Holdings, not divisible among shareholders. No shareholder agreement, LP agreement, or note agreement grants any investor the right to direct, encumber, sell, or license any IP asset.

**4. IP is never collateralized.**
In all strategies — whether secured debt, convertible notes, or equity — the security interest is limited to the physical property and/or operating cash flows. No lien, pledge, or encumbrance attaches to any IP asset. This is a structural non-negotiable.

**5. IP licensing separation strengthens both valuations independently.**
The OpCo is valued on its operating economics (occupancy, ADR, margins). The Holdings entity is valued on its IP portfolio and licensing potential ($19–42M at Year 5). These are additive, not overlapping. The separation means an investor in one entity does not inadvertently acquire a claim on the value held in the other.

**6. Technology development occurs via Light Brands Studio (Dubai) under work-for-hire.**
Studio creates all IP under a Development Services Agreement with Holdings. IP is assigned to Holdings upon delivery. Studio retains no product-specific IP. This arrangement satisfies DEMPE requirements with real substance (office, employees, equipment) in Dubai.

**7. Panama PIF → Panamanian Holdings S.A. holds the founder's ~70% of Holdings.**
The PIF provides the ultimate layer of asset protection. The S.A. intermediate holdco creates double-layer separation. Creditors would need to pierce two separate Panamanian legal entities to reach operating equity.

## 9. Regulatory Pathways

### U.S. Pathways

**Regulation D — Rule 506(b)**
- Unlimited raise amount
- Up to an unlimited number of accredited investors + up to 35 sophisticated (but non-accredited) investors
- No general solicitation or advertising permitted
- Form D filing with SEC required within 15 days of first sale
- Most common pathway for private placements to family offices and accredited investors
- **Best for:** Warm-network fundraising where relationships pre-exist

**Regulation D — Rule 506(c)**
- Unlimited raise amount
- Accredited investors only (must verify accreditation status — tax returns, broker letter, etc.)
- General solicitation and advertising **permitted** (LinkedIn posts, investor platforms, conferences)
- Form D filing required
- **Best for:** Broader outreach to accredited investor networks, family office platforms, syndication

**Regulation A+ (Tier 2)**
- Up to $75M raise in a 12-month period
- Open to both accredited and **non-accredited** investors
- Requires SEC qualification (similar to a mini-IPO process)
- Ongoing reporting obligations (annual, semi-annual)
- More expensive to structure ($150–300K+ in legal and accounting costs)
- **Best for:** Broad retail-style RE raise; crowdfunding-adjacent model; maximum investor count

**Securities vs. Loans — The Distinction**
- Secured promissory notes issued to a small number of institutional lenders may qualify as **loan agreements** rather than securities, potentially avoiding Reg D requirements
- Factors: number of lenders, sophistication of lenders, note terms, manner of offering, investor expectations of profit from efforts of others (Howey test)
- Legal counsel must advise on a case-by-case basis
- **Conservative approach:** Treat all instruments as securities and comply with Reg D

### Non-U.S. Pathways

**Cayman Islands**
- No securities registration required for private placements
- Cayman fund structures (limited partnerships, exempted companies) are standard for international capital
- Well-established legal and regulatory infrastructure for fund formation
- CIMA (Cayman Islands Monetary Authority) registration for registered funds; exempted for small, private funds
- **Best for:** Non-US investor capital; institutional fund structure; avoiding US securities complexity

**Canada**
- Exempt distribution to accredited investors under National Instrument 45-106
- Accredited investor threshold: C$1M+ net financial assets, or C$200K+ individual income (C$300K+ combined)
- Offering memorandum exemption available in some provinces for non-accredited investors
- **Best for:** Canadian family offices, accredited investors

**Mexico**
- Potential for a Mexican HoldCo to raise capital under Mexican securities law (Ley del Mercado de Valores)
- Less common for international fundraising; more complex regulatory environment
- CKD (Certificados de Capital de Desarrollo) structure possible for institutional Mexican capital
- **Best for:** Only if a significant portion of capital comes from Mexican institutional investors

**Panama**
- PIF structure already in place; provides asset protection, not investor-facing fundraising
- Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (SMV) regulates securities; offerings possible but uncommon for international capital
- **Best for:** Not typically used as an investor-facing vehicle; retain as asset protection layer

### Recommended Regulatory Approach

| Investor Type | Recommended Pathway |
|--------------|-------------------|
| US accredited investors (warm network) | Reg D 506(b) |
| US accredited investors (broad outreach) | Reg D 506(c) |
| US non-accredited investors | Reg A+ (only if broad retail raise is desired) |
| Canadian accredited investors | NI 45-106 exempt distribution |
| International / non-US investors | Cayman-domiciled offering (fund LP or note issuance) |
| Small number of institutional lenders (RE debt) | Loan agreements (may avoid securities registration — counsel to advise) |

**Lead with Reg D 506(b) or 506(c)** for US investors. Use a **Cayman-domiciled offering** for non-US investors. Consider Reg A+ only if the RE fund targets a broader, retail-adjacent investor base.

---

## 10. Recommended Approach

### Lead with Strategy A — Offer B and C Based on Investor Preferences

**Strategy A (Structured Real Estate Fund + Management Equity)** is the recommended lead structure for a zero-cash-in model for the following reasons:

**1. GP/LP is the most recognized zero-cash-in structure in institutional finance.**
Fund managers routinely raise hundreds of millions without personal capital contributions. The GP earns carried interest and management fees in exchange for deal sourcing, asset management, and value creation. This is not an unusual ask — it is standard operating procedure. Family offices, institutional allocators, and fund-of-funds are accustomed to this structure and will not question a zero-cash GP commitment.

**2. Buy-back as a core selling point.**
The mandatory LP redemption at Year 5 transforms the investor conversation. Investors are not being asked to commit capital permanently — they are being offered a defined-term instrument with collateral security, preferred return, and a contractual exit. The buy-back is not an afterthought; it is the central feature of the offering.

**3. Investor perception management.**
The most common objection to a zero-cash-in model is: "If founders aren't putting in money, what's their skin in the game?" The answer in Strategy A is structural: founders' skin in the game is (a) their IP portfolio valued at $19–42M by Year 5, (b) their management fee stream tied to fund performance, (c) their carried interest tied to LP returns, and (d) their reputation and multi-year commitment. This is substantively more than a cash contribution.

**4. Regulatory simplicity.**
A Cayman fund LP with Reg D 506(b) for US investors is a well-trodden path with abundant legal precedent. The OpCo equity raise follows the same regulatory framework. No novel or untested structures.

**5. Hybrid optionality.**
If certain investors prefer debt (Strategy B) or convertible instruments (Strategy C), those can be offered on an investor-by-investor basis alongside the fund LP. The strategies are not mutually exclusive.

### When to Pivot to Strategy B

- The target investor pool is heavily weighted toward credit-oriented family offices and fixed-income allocators who will not accept equity-style RE risk
- Investor demand for 10–12% fixed yield exceeds demand for equity upside
- Founders want to avoid any LP governance structure on the RE entity
- Speed of close is critical — secured debt documentation is simpler than fund formation

### When to Pivot to Strategy C

- Lead investors are sophisticated and comfortable with convertible and revenue-participation instruments
- Founders want maximum time to prove the operating model before committing to any permanent dilution
- The capital raise benefits from milestone-based conversion triggers
- The raise is structured in tranches over time rather than a single close

### Hybrid Approach

A practical hybrid for a $16M raise might look like:

| Tranche | Instrument | Amount | Source Strategy |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| RE — Fund LP Equity | GP/LP structure | $7,000,000 | Strategy A |
| RE — Secured Notes | Private secured debt | $4,000,000 | Strategy B |
| OpCo — Preferred Equity | 25% ownership | $2,500,000 | Strategy A |
| OpCo — Revenue Participation | RBF at 2.0x cap | $1,500,000 | Strategy C |
| OpCo — Convertible Note | 8% with optional conversion | $1,000,000 | Strategy C |
| **Total** | | **$16,000,000** | |

This hybrid maximizes the addressable investor universe by offering instruments tailored to different risk/return preferences — all while maintaining $0 founder cash contribution and founder control above all non-negotiable thresholds.
