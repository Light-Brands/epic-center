## 1. TL;DR — Cyprus Founders Have It Easy

Cyprus founders don't need the church. They don't need complex wealth extraction channels. They don't need to navigate worldwide taxation. Cyprus's **non-domiciled (non-dom) regime** is one of the most generous in the world for passive income, and combined with the UAE structure, it produces a near-zero effective tax rate with minimal complexity.

| **Overall effective rate** | | **~0.2%** |

## 2. Why Cyprus Is Different from the US

The US founder needs the church structure because the US taxes citizens on **worldwide income regardless of where they live**. Even living in Dubai, a US citizen owes tax on every dollar earned anywhere on Earth.

Cyprus does the opposite:

| Factor | United States | Cyprus |
|---|---|---|
| Tax basis | **Citizenship** (worldwide, forever) | **Residency** (stop being resident = stop paying tax) |
| Dividends | Taxed at 0-23.8% (plus 3.8% NIIT) | **0% income tax + 0% SDC (non-dom) + 2.65% GESY** |
| Capital gains on shares | 0-23.8% (plus 3.8% NIIT) | **0%** |
| Foreign employment income | Taxed (FEIE covers $130K) | **0% if work done abroad >90 days** |
| CFC/GILTI rules for individuals | Yes — complex, punitive | **No CFC for individuals** (only companies) |
| Exit tax | Yes (expatriation tax > $866K) | **No exit tax** |
| Church needed? | **Yes** — to create tax-free channels | **No** — tax code already provides them |

**Bottom line:** A Cyprus founder plugged into the TE structure gets nearly everything tax-free by default. No church. No housing allowance. No retirement stacking. Just straightforward non-dom benefits.

## 3. The Cyprus Non-Dom Regime — How It Works

### What Is Non-Dom?

"Non-domiciled" means you're a **tax resident** of Cyprus but your **domicile** (permanent home of origin or choice) is elsewhere. If you weren't born in Cyprus and haven't lived there for 17 of the last 20 years, you qualify automatically.

### What You Get

| Benefit | Detail | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **0% SDC on dividends** | Special Defence Contribution (normally 17%) is fully exempt for non-doms | 17 years (rolling 20-year window) |
| **0% SDC on interest** | Interest income SDC (normally 17%) fully exempt | 17 years |
| **0% capital gains on securities** | Disposal of shares, bonds, debentures — fully exempt regardless of domicile | Permanent |
| **GESY (healthcare) on passive income** | 2.65% on dividends/interest, **capped at EUR 180,000** (max EUR 4,770/yr) | Ongoing |
| **No exit tax** | Leave Cyprus whenever you want, no deemed disposition | Permanent |

### The 17-Year Clock

Non-dom status lasts until you've been a Cyprus tax resident for 17 out of the last 20 years. But this is a **rolling window** — if you break residency for a year or two, the clock pauses. Unlike the US, you're not locked in. You can leave, come back, and the benefits continue.

## 4. Three Paths for Cyprus Founders

### Path A: The Hybrid (Recommended)

**Live primarily between Dubai and Cyprus. Tax resident in Cyprus via the 60-day rule. Work from Dubai most of the year.**

```mermaid

    style DIV fill:#0a8754,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
    style CG fill:#0a8754,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
```

**60-Day Rule Requirements (ALL must be met):**

| Requirement | How to Meet It |
|---|---|
| Spend at least 60 days in Cyprus | Maintain a home, spend ~2 months/year |
| NOT be tax resident in any other country | Don't apply for UAE tax residency certificate; don't spend 183+ days in any single other country |
| Not spend more than 183 days in any other single country | Split time between Dubai, Mexico, travel |
| Have business/employment in a Cyprus entity | Hold a directorship in a Cyprus company, OR maintain employment with a Cyprus-linked entity |
| Maintain a permanent residence in Cyprus | Own or rent a home in Cyprus |

**Tax Math for Path A:**

| Income | Amount | Tax Treatment | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| UAE salary (work done outside Cyprus >90 days) | $200,000-400,000 | **100% exempt** — non-resident employer, services outside Cyprus >90 days | **$0** |
| PIF distributions (dividends) | $200,000-1,000,000 | 0% SDC (non-dom) + 0% income tax + 2.65% GESY capped at EUR 4,770 | **~$5,200** (EUR 4,770) |
| Capital gains on any share disposal | Variable | **0%** | **$0** |
| **Total on $400K-1.4M income** | | | **~$5,200/yr** |

**Effective rate: 0.4% on $1.4M → 1.3% on $400K → always capped at EUR 4,770/yr GESY.**

**Why this path is best:**
- Maintain EU residency and lifestyle (Cyprus = EU member)
- Access to EU healthcare system
- Near-zero tax
- No need to fully relocate to Dubai
- Can still spend significant time at the Tulum facility and in Dubai for work
- Keep an apartment in Limassol or Paphos as home base

### Path B: Full Dubai Move (Like the Canadian Founder)

**Drop Cyprus residency entirely. Move to Dubai. Get a Golden Visa.**

| Income | Tax |
|---|---|
| UAE salary | **$0** (no personal income tax in UAE) |
| PIF distributions | **$0** (no personal income tax in UAE) |
| Capital gains | **$0** |
| **Everything** | **$0** |

**Trade-offs:**
- Lose EU residency (can still visit as tourist for 90/180 days)
- Must establish genuine UAE residency (Golden Visa + Emirates ID)
- 0% vs 0.2% — marginal improvement over Path A
- Lose the Cyprus lifestyle and EU access

**Recommendation:** Only choose Path B if the founder genuinely wants to live in Dubai full-time. The tax difference between Path A and Path B is EUR 4,770/year — not worth restructuring your life around.

### Path C: Full Cyprus Residency (183+ Days)

**Stay in Cyprus full-time. Use the 50% employment exemption.**

If a Cyprus founder prefers to live in Cyprus and not travel extensively:

| Income | Tax Treatment | Effective Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Employment salary (Article 8(23A) — 50% exemption) | Only 50% of salary is taxable; progressive rates up to 35% on the taxable half | **~17.5% maximum** on total salary |
| PIF distributions (dividends) | 0% SDC (non-dom) + 2.65% GESY capped | **~0.2%** |
| Capital gains on securities | 0% | **0%** |

**Article 8(23A) Details:**
- Requires first employment in Cyprus after 15+ consecutive years of non-residency
- Salary must exceed EUR 55,000/year
- Exemption lasts **17 years**
- Can change employers and keep the exemption

**Tax Math for Path C (EUR 200K salary + EUR 500K dividends):**

| Income | Amount | Calculation | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salary (50% exempt) | EUR 200,000 | 50% = EUR 100,000 taxable. Tax: ~EUR 24,050 | **~EUR 24,050** |
| Dividends | EUR 500,000 | 0% SDC + 2.65% GESY (capped EUR 4,770) | **EUR 4,770** |
| **Total** | EUR 700,000 | | **~EUR 28,820** |
| **Effective rate** | | | **~4.1%** |

**Recommendation:** Path C is still excellent but Path A is strictly better if the founder is willing to spend 90+ days working from Dubai.

---

## 5. The PIF Question: Can Cyprus Founders Be Beneficiaries?

**Yes — and this is a major advantage over the US founder.**

The US founder cannot be a PIF beneficiary because the IRS would look through the PIF and attribute CFC/GILTI income. Cyprus has no equivalent rule for individuals:

| Issue | US Founder | Cyprus Founder |
|---|---|---|
| Can be PIF beneficiary? | **No** (triggers CFC/GILTI) | **Yes** |
| PIF distributions taxable? | N/A (not a beneficiary) | As dividends: **0% SDC (non-dom) + 2.65% GESY (capped)** |
| CFC rules for individuals? | **Yes** — punitive | **No** — Cyprus CFC only applies to companies |
| Look-through rules? | IRS looks through trusts/foundations | No equivalent for individuals |

**How distributions work:**

### The Panama-EU Blacklist Consideration

Panama is on the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. For Cyprus:

| Concern | Reality |
|---|---|
| Does the blacklist add withholding tax for individuals? | **No** — Cyprus blacklist WHT rules apply to payments FROM Cyprus companies TO Panama entities, not to individual beneficiaries receiving FROM Panama |
| DAC6 reporting? | **Possibly** — cross-border arrangements involving blacklisted jurisdictions may trigger mandatory disclosure requirements. This is a **reporting** obligation, not a tax |
| Reputational risk? | **Low-moderate** — banks and compliance officers may ask additional questions |
| Alternative to PIF? | If counsel advises, could use a Liechtenstein foundation or Netherlands BV as the holding layer instead of Panama. But PIF remains functional for individuals. |

**Recommendation:** Keep the Panama PIF for now. If Cyprus counsel flags concerns, consider restructuring the holding layer to a non-blacklisted jurisdiction (Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands). The cost is minimal and the PIF structure translates directly.

## 7. Implementation for Cyprus Founders

### What They Need to Do

**If Already Cyprus Resident (Non-Dom):**

| Step | Detail | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Confirm non-dom status | Verify they haven't been Cyprus tax resident for 17 of last 20 years | 1 week (with Cyprus tax advisor) |
| 2. Verify 60-day rule eligibility | Confirm no tax residency in another country; maintain Cyprus home | 1 week |
| 3. Employment with UAE entity | Execute employment agreement with TE Global Technology FZ-LLC | 1 week |
| 4. PIF beneficiary status | Panama counsel adds Cyprus founder(s) as PIF beneficiaries in private regulations | 2-3 weeks |
| 5. Plan the year | Ensure 60+ days in Cyprus, 90+ working days outside Cyprus, <183 days in any single other country | Ongoing |
| 6. Cyprus tax filing | Annual personal income tax return declaring salary (exempt) and dividends (GESY only) | Annually |

**If Becoming Cyprus Resident (New):**

| Step | Detail | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Establish Cyprus residency | Rent or buy a home in Cyprus | 2-4 weeks |
| 2. Apply for Cyprus tax residency | Register with Cyprus Tax Department | 2-4 weeks |
| 3. Confirm non-dom status | File declaration of non-domicile status | 1-2 weeks |
| 4. Cyprus company directorship (for 60-day rule) | Appoint as director of a Cyprus holding company or advisory entity | 1-2 weeks |
| 5. Employment with UAE entity | Execute employment agreement | 1 week |
| 6. PIF beneficiary status | Add to PIF private regulations | 2-3 weeks |

**Total setup time: 4-8 weeks**

### What They DON'T Need

| Not Needed | Why |
|---|---|
| Church / 508(c)(1)(A) | That's a US-specific structure for US worldwide taxation. Cyprus doesn't tax dividends or foreign employment income. |
| Housing allowance | Cyprus doesn't have an equivalent need — housing costs aren't a tax benefit vehicle because income is already untaxed |
| Complex retirement stacking | No need — dividends are already at 0% SDC + 2.65% GESY capped |
| UAE Golden Visa | Optional — only needed if spending significant time in Dubai. Can enter UAE on visa-free entry for short stays |
| Renunciation of citizenship | Cyprus doesn't tax based on citizenship. Residency-based taxation = just move if you want to stop. |

---

## 8. CFC Considerations

Cyprus CFC rules only apply to **companies**, not individuals. But if a Cyprus founder holds shares through a Cyprus company (rather than personally or through the PIF), CFC rules could apply to that company.

### Does the UAE Entity Trigger CFC?

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Is the UAE entity controlled by a Cyprus company? | Only if structured that way — in the current model, **PIF owns the UAE entity, not a Cyprus company** |
| Is the UAE entity low-taxed? | Yes — 0% QFZP < 6.25% threshold (50% of Cyprus 12.5%) |
| Is there substance? | **Yes** — Dubai team of 5-6 people, real office, real IP development. Substance exemption applies. |

**For the recommended structure (PIF → UAE entity):** CFC rules don't apply because no Cyprus company is in the ownership chain. The PIF (Panama) owns the UAE entity. Cyprus founders receive distributions as PIF beneficiaries — these are taxed as dividend income at the individual level (0% SDC + 2.65% GESY).

**If for any reason a Cyprus holding company is inserted:** CFC rules would theoretically apply, but the **substantive activity exemption** would protect the UAE entity because it has genuine economic substance (employees, office, IP development, management decisions in Dubai).

## 9. Year-by-Year Projections (Cyprus Founder — Path A)

Assuming the Cyprus founder receives both salary from the UAE entity and distributions from the PIF, scaling with the business:

### Year 1

| Income | Amount | Tax |
|---|---|---|
| UAE salary (CTO/executive role) | $200,000 | $0 (90-day exemption) |
| PIF distribution | $100,000 | $0 SDC + ~$2,900 GESY |
| **Total** | **$300,000** | **~$2,900** |
| **Effective rate** | | **~1.0%** |

### Year 3

| Income | Amount | Tax |
|---|---|---|
| UAE salary | $300,000 | $0 (90-day exemption) |
| PIF distribution | $400,000 | $0 SDC + ~$5,200 GESY (capped) |
| **Total** | **$700,000** | **~$5,200** |
| **Effective rate** | | **~0.7%** |

### Year 5

| Income | Amount | Tax |
|---|---|---|
| UAE salary | $400,000 | $0 (90-day exemption) |
| PIF distribution | $1,000,000 | $0 SDC + ~$5,200 GESY (capped) |
| Capital gains (if any equity events) | Variable | $0 |
| **Total** | **$1,400,000** | **~$5,200** |
| **Effective rate** | | **~0.4%** |

**The GESY cap is the magic:** No matter how much dividend income flows through, the healthcare contribution maxes out at EUR 4,770/year (~$5,200). Whether you earn $500K or $5M in dividends, the tax is the same $5,200.

---

## 10. Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **60-day rule challenged** | Low | High — lose salary exemption, face progressive rates on employment income | Keep meticulous travel records. Maintain Cyprus home. Don't accidentally become tax resident elsewhere. |
| **90-day overseas exemption challenged** | Low | High — salary becomes taxable in Cyprus | Document days worked outside Cyprus. Keep timesheets. Employment contract clearly with UAE (non-resident) entity. |
| **Non-dom status challenged** | Very Low | Critical — 17% SDC on dividends | File non-dom declaration. Maintain domicile of choice documentation. Don't establish "permanent home" in Cyprus sense of domicile (different from tax residency). |
| **Panama PIF / EU blacklist** | Low-Medium | Medium — DAC6 reporting, bank compliance questions | Transparent reporting. If counsel advises, restructure to Liechtenstein or Luxembourg foundation. |
| **Cyprus CFC (if company in chain)** | Low | Medium — CFC income attributed to Cyprus company | Keep Cyprus company OUT of the ownership chain. PIF → UAE entity directly. |
| **UAE QFZP loss** | Medium | Medium — 9% UAE CT instead of 0% | Same mitigation as for all founders. 9% still favorable. |
| **Cyprus tax reform** | Low | Medium — non-dom benefits could change | Monitor EU/OECD developments. 17-year window provides long runway. Cyprus has strong incentive to maintain regime (attracts foreign capital). |

---

## 11. Open Questions for Cyprus Tax Counsel

1. **60-day rule + Dubai work split**: Confirm that spending 90+ working days in Dubai for a UAE employer qualifies for the overseas employment exemption while maintaining 60-day tax residency
2. **PIF distributions classification**: Confirm that distributions from a Panama PIF to a Cyprus non-dom individual are treated as dividend income (0% SDC + 2.65% GESY) and not "other income" (which could be taxed at progressive rates)
3. **Panama blacklist impact on individuals**: Confirm no additional withholding or penalty for Cyprus individuals receiving income from Panama entities
4. **Non-dom + 60-day interaction**: Confirm both statuses can be held simultaneously (they should, but worth confirming)
5. **DAC6 reporting**: Determine if the PIF → UAE → Cyprus individual structure triggers mandatory disclosure and if so, what the compliance cost is
6. **Business nexus for 60-day rule**: Confirm that holding a directorship in a Cyprus advisory company (or being employed by the UAE entity) satisfies the "business/employment in Cyprus" requirement
7. **Future-proofing**: Any pending EU directives that could affect the non-dom regime or the 60-day rule?

## 12. The Bottom Line

| Metric | Canadian Founder | Cyprus Founder | US Founder |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Structure needed** | PIF + UAE entity | PIF + UAE entity | PIF + UAE entity + Church |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Simple | Complex |
| **Setup cost** | ~$5K | ~$5K + Cyprus home | ~$20K+ (includes church formation) |
| **Annual compliance cost** | Minimal | ~$3K (Cyprus tax filing) | ~$10-15K (US returns + church compliance) |
| **Year 5 personal income** | ~$1.5M | ~$1.4M | ~$2.3M (incl. deferred + assets) |
| **Year 5 tax** | **$0** | **~$5,200** | **~$85,400** |
| **Effective rate** | **0%** | **~0.4%** | **~3.7%** |
| **Can be PIF beneficiary?** | Yes | **Yes** | No |
| **Needs the church?** | For stipend only | **No** | Yes (critical) |

**Cyprus founders get 99.6% of the Canadian founder's tax benefit with the added advantage of EU residency, EU healthcare, and EU travel freedom.** They don't need any of the US-specific structures. They just need non-dom status, the 60-day rule, and a seat on the PIF.

The only cost: EUR 4,770/year in healthcare contributions. That's the entire tax bill on $1.4M+ of income.
