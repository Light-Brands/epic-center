# The Equity Conversion Deal

**We buy the property for $11.9M. $2M cash at closing. The remaining $9.9M converts into 15% equity in the Mexican Real Estate Company + 15% equity in the Mexican Operating Company. No interest. No debt. Pure equity conversion. His 15% is projected to be worth $22M in 5 years. Either party can trigger a buyout at Year 5 over 24–36 months. Total value: $24M+ vs. $12M from a straight sale.**

---

## Why This Structure — Not a Straight Sale?

He invested $30M. He's selling for $11.9M. That's an $18M gap no matter how you cut it.

Selling gives him $11.9M cash. Total realistic value from selling: **~$11.9M**.

Our deal gives him $2M cash at closing, 15% ownership in two companies projected to reach $147M at Year 5 (his 15% = $22M), and participation in a mission that gives his property meaning. Total value: **$24M+**.

```
STRAIGHT SALE:
  $11.9M cash
  = ~$11.9M total
  + a story about selling at a loss

EQUITY CONVERSION DEAL:
  $2M cash + 15% Mexican Real Estate Co + 15% Mexican Operating Co ($22M at Year 5)
  = $24M+ total
  + a story about launching a global healing movement
```

It's not even close.

## The Structure: $11.9M Purchase Price

```
PURCHASE PRICE:   $11,900,000

PAID AS:
  $2,000,000 -----> Cash at closing (immediate liquidity)
  $9,900,000 -----> Converted into equity:
                      • 15% equity in Mexican Real Estate Company
                      • 15% equity in Mexican Operating Company

NOT seller financing.
NOT structured debt.
NOT a note with interest.
NO interest is paid on the $9.9M balance.

This is a full equity conversion — $9.9M in value exchanged for
ownership stakes in two operating entities.

This is an equity-based partnership structure.
The $9.9M is effectively reinvested by the seller into the
project as equity participation.
```

---

## Property Security

The seller maintains **full lien security on the property** during the agreed structure period. This ensures alignment between both parties and provides downside protection for his position.

---

## Two Companies, Clear Separation

### Mexican Real Estate Company
- Owns the physical property
- Captures asset appreciation
- Seller gets **15% equity** — participates in property value growth

### Mexican Operating Company
- Runs the business (clinical operations, guests, revenue)
- Captures operating profit and enterprise value
- Seller gets **15% equity** — participates in business growth

**Why separate?** Clean separation protects the asset from operational risk. Each entity has its own valuation trajectory. The seller benefits from both.

---

## The $5M Operational Investment

Separately, we're committing **$5 million in operational capital** into the Mexican Operating Company:

- Medical buildout and clinical infrastructure
- Staff recruitment and training
- Technology and guest experience systems
- Marketing, brand launch, guest acquisition
- Working capital through ramp-up

This is NOT part of the $11.9M purchase price. This is additional capital invested to build the operation on the foundation the seller created.

---

## What 15% Is Worth: Year by Year

*Enterprise values below reflect the combined Mexico operation (Mexican Operating Company + Mexican Real Estate Company).*

| Year | Mexico Enterprise Value | His 15% | What's Happening |
|------|------------------------|---------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $29,000,000 | $4,350,000 | Building + first guests |
| Year 2 | $55,000,000 | $8,250,000 | Ramping to capacity |
| Year 3 | $87,000,000 | $13,050,000 | Full operations + at capacity |
| Year 4 | $110,000,000 | $16,500,000 | Brand established + training programs |
| Year 5 | $147,000,000 | **$22,050,000** | Mature operation + multiple revenue streams |

He receives $2M cash immediately. His $9.9M equity conversion is projected to reach $22M in ownership value by Year 5 — a 122% return on the converted amount.

*All projections are estimates based on the current operating model and are subject to change.*

---

## The $22M Year 5 Projection Logic

The $147M combined enterprise value at Year 5 is driven by:

- Revenue ramp from initial guest cohorts to full capacity
- Multiple revenue streams: clinical programs, extended stays, training, licensing
- Asset appreciation as purpose-built medical wellness facility
- Brand premium from first-mover advantage
- Operating leverage: fixed-cost infrastructure with scaling revenue

His 15% of $147M = **$22,050,000** *(projected)*.

---

## Why 15% + 15%

```
His property (market value):              $11,900,000
Cash he receives at closing:              $2,000,000
Value converted to equity:                $9,900,000
15% of our Year 5 value ($147M):         $22,050,000 (projected)

The $9.9M equity conversion grows to $22M — a 122% return.

Not 25% because $36.75M overvalues a $9.9M conversion by 3.7x.
Not 10% because $14.7M barely clears the converted amount.
15% + 15% = $22M. Clean. Fair. Generous. Defensible.
```

## What the Seller Gets

```
SELLER gets:
  Cash at closing -------> $2,000,000 (immediate liquidity)
  15% Mexican RE Co -----> Participation in asset appreciation
  15% Mexican Ops Co ----> Participation in operating growth
  Combined equity (Yr 5) > Worth $22M at Year 5 (projected)
  Property security -----> Full lien security during structure period
  Buyout option ---------> Mutual Year 5 buyout over 24–36 months with interest
  Purpose --------------> Founding Steward of a healing center
  Legacy ---------------> His name on the wall. His property changes lives.
                           ---------
                           TOTAL: $24M+
                           vs. $11.9M from a sale
```

**What the seller gets (plain English):**
- $2 million cash at closing — immediate liquidity
- 15% ownership in the Mexican Real Estate Company — participates in asset value growth
- 15% ownership in the Mexican Operating Company — participates in business growth
- Combined equity projected to be worth $22M at Year 5
- Full lien security on the property during the structure period
- Mutual Year 5 buyout option at fair value, paid over 24–36 months with interest
- A permanent title and recognition

**What we get:**
- The property for $2M cash + equity (no $12M capital raise needed)
- Only need $5M for operations (instead of $17M+)
- 85% of both the Mexican Real Estate Company and the Mexican Operating Company
- Full voting control. His 15% is non-voting in both entities
- Year 5 buyout option. We can consolidate to 100% at FMV
- A seller who's now our most powerful advocate

**The pitch to the seller:**
> "The market values your property at $11.9 million. We'll give you $2 million cash at closing and convert the remaining $9.9 million into 15% equity in the Mexican Real Estate Company and 15% equity in the Mexican Operating Company. No interest. No debt. Pure ownership. Your 15% is projected to be worth $22 million in five years. This isn't seller financing. This is your seat at the table."

**Who this works for:** A seller who invested $30 million and eight years into this property and wants more than a check. Who built something with his hands and can't stomach watching it get flipped into condos. This is purpose. This is partnership.

---

## The Five-Year Partnership Window & Buyout

The 15% ownership in both entities is structured around a **five-year value creation period**.

After Year 5, **either party** may initiate a buyout of the seller's 15% in both companies at fair market value.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Who can trigger** | Either party (seller or founders) |
| **Earliest exercise** | Year 5 |
| **Price** | Fair Market Value at time of buyout |
| **FMV method** | Independent third-party valuation, or pre-agreed EBITDA multiple methodology |
| **Payment timeline** | 24–36 months from exercise date |
| **Interest** | Interest accrues on the buyout valuation amount |
| **Notice** | 60 days written notice |

**What this looks like:**
- Year 5: Buyout at ~$22.05M *(projected)*, paid over 24–36 months with interest
- Or neither party exercises. The partnership continues.

This is balanced, fair, and mutually protective. Both sides have liquidity rights at fair value.

---

## Optional: Tax-Efficient Enhancement

The primary offer is the equity conversion partnership. It stands fully on its own merit.

If a **tax-efficient structure** can be legally implemented and is beneficial to the seller, we will collaborate to structure it accordingly. This could include donating a portion of equity or property value into a qualifying charitable structure.

**What it could provide, if applicable:**

- **Tax credit benefits** — Charitable contribution of qualifying assets could generate meaningful tax credits or deductions
- **Strategic tax efficiency** — A donation into a 501(c)(3) or similar entity could create additional tax savings
- **Legacy positioning** — Adds a philanthropic dimension to the seller's involvement in the mission

**How it relates to the core deal:**

This option does NOT change the equity conversion structure. The $2M cash, 15% + 15% equity, and buyout terms remain intact.

**Important clarifications:**

- If this pathway is not viable or not advantageous, the primary partnership structure stands entirely on its own.
- Tax implications are conditional and subject to independent professional verification.
- This is not presented as a tax write-off strategy. It is an optional enhancement only.
- Do not lead conversations with tax benefits. The equity partnership is the offer.

*No heavy tax assumptions are made here. This scenario requires independent tax advice specific to the seller's situation.*

## Best Case vs. Worst Case vs. Selling

| | Sell for $11.9M | Equity Conversion Partnership |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash at closing** | $11,900,000 | $2,000,000 |
| **15% equity value (Yr 5)** | $0 | $22,050,000 (projected) |
| **Subtotal** | **~$11,900,000** | **$24,050,000** |
| **Optional: Tax enhancement savings** | N/A | +$2M to $9M (if applicable) |
| **Total with optional enhancement** | **~$11,900,000** | **$26M – $33M+** |
| **vs. selling** | - | +$12M to $21M more |
| **Purpose** | None | Full |
| **His role** | Former owner | Founding partner |

Even without the optional tax enhancement, the equity conversion deal is worth **$12M+ more than selling**. The equity is the engine. The tax enhancement is an optional accelerator.

---

## The Card in the Back Pocket

If he hesitates, we have a sweetener we don't show upfront:

**50% of profits above a threshold.**

```
IF our EBITDA exceeds $15M in any year:
  Seller gets 50% of everything above $15M
  Capped at $10M total over 5 years

Example:
  Year 3: $15.4M EBITDA → $220K to seller
  Year 4: $18.1M EBITDA → $1.55M to seller
  Year 5: $20.3M EBITDA → $2.65M to seller
  Total: ~$4.4M extra
```

**Only play this card if he's on the fence.** Start with the base deal. This is the closer.

---

## The Initiation: Bring the Medicine to Him

Before any numbers. Before any term sheet. Before any pitch.

We bring the ibogaine experience to his property. Full medical team. Full ceremony. On his land, in rooms he built.

**Why:**
- He *feels* what we're building instead of hearing about it
- He experiences transformation in his own home. The property becomes sacred to him in a new way
- Post-journey, he's in a state of clarity, openness, and purpose
- The pitch isn't theoretical anymore. He has a direct reference

**The sequence:**
1. Visit. Build relationship. Share the vision. No numbers.
2. Invite him to experience the medicine. On his property.
3. After integration, share the equity conversion concept.
4. Present the one-term offer.
5. Send $100K deposit on verbal agreement.

---

## The One Thing That Kills This Deal

**If the seller doesn't believe in the vision.** The equity conversion only works if the seller sees the upside. If he just wants cash, the $2M at closing won't compete with $11.9M from a straight sale.

Other things that make it harder (but don't kill it):
- Debt on the property — must be paid off or assumed at closing
- He's impatient — equity is a long game; he needs to buy into Year 5
- No aligned nonprofit — only matters for the optional tax enhancement scenario

None of those are fatal. They just take time and alignment to solve.

---

## What We Need to Find Out

Before we present this to him, we need to know:

1. **Is there a mortgage?** (Must be addressed at closing)
2. **What's his appetite for equity vs. cash?** (Determines how hard we lean on the vision)
3. **Is he a US taxpayer?** (Only matters for the optional tax enhancement scenario)
4. **What does he make per year?** (Only matters for tax enhancement deduction utilization)

Get those answers and we can dial this in precisely.

---

## Key Distinction: This Is NOT Seller Financing

| | Seller Financing | Our Equity Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| **What seller holds** | A note (debt instrument) | Equity (ownership stakes) |
| **Interest** | Yes, interest accrues | No interest on $9.9M |
| **Risk** | Default risk on payments | Enterprise risk (upside + downside) |
| **Upside** | Capped at note amount + interest | Uncapped — grows with enterprise value |
| **Seller's role** | Creditor | Owner / Partner |
| **Relationship** | Adversarial (debtor vs. creditor) | Aligned (shared upside) |
| **Tax treatment** | Interest income | Capital gains on equity |

The seller is not carrying a note. The seller is not financing the deal. The seller is converting $9.9M of value into ownership in two companies. This is a fundamentally different structure with fundamentally different upside.

---

**Bottom line:** $11.9M purchase price. $2M cash at closing. $9.9M converted into 15% equity in the Mexican Real Estate Company + 15% equity in the Mexican Operating Company. No interest. No debt. His 15% is projected to be worth $22M at Year 5. Mutual buyout rights after Year 5, paid over 24–36 months with interest. Optional tax-efficient enhancement layers on top if applicable. Either way, it's worth $12M+ more than a straight sale. We get the property, he gets purpose and equity in both entities, and either party can trigger a buyout when the time is right. Seller invested $30M total. This deal gives him a path to recover — and exceed — that investment through partnership.
