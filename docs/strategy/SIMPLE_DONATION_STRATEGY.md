# The Donation Deal

**He donates the property. Gets a massive tax write-off. Gets 25% of everything we build. Total value: $38-46M vs. $11.9M from a sale.**

---

## Why Donate Instead of Sell?

He paid $28M. He's selling for $11.9M. That's a $16M loss no matter how you cut it.

Selling gives him $11.9M cash and a capital loss he can barely use ($3,000/year against regular income). Total realistic value from selling: **~$14M**.

Donating gives him a tax write-off worth $2-9M, 25% ownership in a $147M company, and a reason to get out of bed. Total value: **$38-46M**.

```
SELLING:
  $11.9M cash + ~$2.4M in tax savings from capital loss
  = ~$14M total
  + a story about losing money in his divorce

DONATING:
  $0 cash + $2-9M tax write-off + 25% of a $147M business
  = $38-46M total
  + a story about launching a global healing movement
```

It's not even close.

## How It Works

```
STEP 1:  Seller donates the property to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
            |
STEP 2:  He gets a charitable tax deduction worth $14-22M
         (based on an independent appraisal — NOT his $28M cost)
            |
STEP 3:  Tax savings: $2-9M over 6 years
         (depends on his income — higher income = bigger savings)
            |
STEP 4:  SEPARATELY, he gets 25% equity in our operating company
         (for advisory services, expertise, and being part of the team)
            |
STEP 5:  The nonprofit owns the property. We lease it. We operate.
         He's a Founding Steward with a seat at the table.

## What the Seller Gets

```
SELLER gets:
  Tax write-off -------> $2M to $9M in saved taxes (over 6 years)
  25% of OpCo ---------> Worth $36.75M at Year 5
  Advisory role --------> $50K/year + annual retreat stay
  Purpose -------------> Founding Steward of a healing center
  Legacy --------------> His name on the wall. His property changes lives.
                         ---------
                         TOTAL: $38M to $46M
                         vs. $14M from a sale
```

**What the seller gets (plain English):**
- A tax deduction that could save him $2-9M depending on his income
- 25% ownership in a business projected to be worth $147M in 5 years
- A title, a role, quarterly calls, and an annual visit to his property
- The most powerful personal story he'll ever tell

**What we get:**
- The property at zero acquisition cost (no $10-12M capital raise needed)
- Only need $5M for operations (instead of $15-17M)
- 75% of the operating company
- Full voting control — his 25% is non-voting
- A seller who's now our most powerful advocate (he owns 25%)
- All IP stays protected in our Cayman entity — untouched

**The pitch to the seller:**
> "You invested $28 million building this place. The market wants to give you $12 million and a handshake. We want to give you a $9 million tax write-off, 25% of a $147 million company, and a front-row seat to watch your property change the world. This isn't a sale. This is your legacy."

**Who this works for:** A seller who wants purpose. Who's tired of writing checks and getting nothing back but receipts. Who built something with his hands and can't stomach watching it get flipped into condos. Who said out loud: "I need more purpose." This is that purpose.

## The $28M Write-Off Question

**Can he write off the full $28M he invested?**

Probably not. Here's why:

The IRS doesn't care what he paid. The charitable deduction is based on what the property is **worth today** — determined by an independent appraiser. He paid $28M but the market says it's worth ~$12M. The appraisal will land somewhere in between.

```
What he paid:            $28,000,000  ← doesn't matter for the deduction
What it's listed at:     $11,900,000  ← the floor
What an appraiser says:  $14-22M     ← THIS is the deduction
```

**Why the appraisal could be higher than $11.9M:**
- The listing price reflects a divorce fire sale — not true market value
- Replacement cost to rebuild this property today: $20M+
- Income potential as a wellness retreat: supports $15-25M valuation
- Take it off the market, wait 60-90 days, get a proper appraisal

**Realistic range:** $15-22M. We target the high end with a top-tier appraiser who uses cost and income approaches.

**The honest answer:** He probably writes off $15-22M, not $28M. But even at $15M, the tax savings are $2-5.5M — and combined with the equity, the deal is still worth 3x more than selling.

## The Tax Write-Off — How Fast He Uses It

The deduction is limited to **30% of his annual income**. Whatever he can't use in Year 1 carries forward for 5 more years (6 years total). After that, anything unused is gone.

**If he makes $15M/year** (best case):

| Year | Deduction Used | Tax Saved | Running Total |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $1,890,000 |
| 2 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $3,780,000 |
| 3 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $5,670,000 |
| 4 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $7,560,000 |
| 5 | $4,000,000 | $1,680,000 | **$9,240,000** |
| | **$22M used — nothing wasted** | | |

**If he makes $3M/year** (worst case):

| Year | Deduction Used | Tax Saved | Running Total |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $315,000 |
| 2 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $630,000 |
| 3 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $945,000 |
| 4 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $1,260,000 |
| 5 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $1,575,000 |
| 6 | $900,000 | $315,000 | **$1,890,000** |
| | **$5.4M used — $8.6M wasted** | | |

**Bottom line:** His income determines how much of the write-off he actually gets to use. Higher income = more savings. But even in the worst case, the equity makes the deal worth it.

## Best Case vs. Worst Case vs. Selling

| | Sell for $11.9M | Donate (Worst Case) | Donate (Best Case) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cash in hand** | $11,900,000 | $0 | $0 |
| **Tax savings** | ~$2,400,000 | ~$2,400,000 | ~$9,200,000 |
| **25% OpCo equity** | $0 | $36,750,000 | $36,750,000 |
| **Total 5-year value** | **~$14,000,000** | **~$38,000,000** | **~$46,000,000** |
| **vs. selling** | — | +$24M more | +$32M more |
| **Purpose** | None | Full | Full |
| **His story** | "Sold at a loss" | "Built a healing center" | "Built a healing center" |

Even in the worst case, the donation deal is worth **$24M more than selling**. The equity is the engine. The tax write-off is the cherry on top.

## The Card in the Back Pocket

If he hesitates, we have a sweetener we don't show upfront:

**50% of profits above a threshold.**

```
IF our EBITDA exceeds $15M in any year:
  Seller gets 50% of everything above $15M
  Capped at $10M total over 5 years

Example:
  Year 3: $15.4M EBITDA → $220K to seller
  Year 4: $18.1M EBITDA → $1.55M to seller
  Year 5: $20.3M EBITDA → $2.65M to seller
  Total: ~$4.4M extra

This pushes the deal past $50M total value.
```

**Only play this card if he's on the fence.** Start with the base deal. This is the closer.

## The Initiation: Bring the Medicine to Him

Before any numbers. Before any term sheet. Before any pitch.

We bring the ibogaine experience to his property. Full medical team. Full ceremony. On his land, in rooms he built.

**Why:**
- He *feels* what we're building instead of hearing about it
- He experiences transformation in his own home — the property becomes sacred to him in a new way
- Post-journey, he's in a state of clarity, openness, and purpose
- The pitch isn't theoretical anymore — he has a direct reference

**The sequence:**
1. Visit. Build relationship. Share the vision. No numbers.
2. Invite him to experience the medicine. On his property.
3. After integration — share the donation concept.
4. Present the one-term offer.
5. Send $100K deposit on verbal agreement.

---

## The One Thing That Kills This Deal

**If he's not a US taxpayer, the tax write-off doesn't work.** The entire charitable deduction is a US tax benefit. No US taxes = no deduction = no tax savings. The deal still works on the equity alone ($36.75M), but the write-off disappears.

Other things that make it harder (but don't kill it):
- Marital property → need divorce court approval
- Debt on the property → must be paid off first
- Low income → wastes part of the deduction
- No aligned nonprofit → need to form one (3-12 months)

None of those are fatal. They just take time and money to solve.

---

## What We Need to Find Out

Before we present this to him, we need to know:

1. **Is he a US taxpayer?** (The whole strategy depends on this)
2. **What does he make per year?** (Determines how much of the write-off he can use)
3. **Is the property 100% his?** (If marital, divorce court has to approve)
4. **Is there a mortgage?** (Must be paid off before donation)
5. **What's Travis's 501(c)(3)?** (Mission, status, board — has to be the right fit)

Get those five answers and we can dial this in precisely.

---

**Bottom line:** Every version of this deal — best case, worst case, somewhere in between — is worth multiples more than selling. The worst case is $38M. The best case is $46M+. Selling is $14M. He gets purpose, legacy, equity, and a tax write-off. We get the property at zero cost and only need to raise $5M instead of $17M. Everyone wins.
