# The Donation Deal

**He donates the property. Gets a massive tax write-off. Gets 14% of everything we build — worth $20M in 5 years. We can buy him out anytime. Total value: $22-29M vs. $11.9M from a sale.**

---

## Why Donate Instead of Sell?

He paid $28M. He's selling for $11.9M. That's a $16M loss no matter how you cut it.

Selling gives him $11.9M cash and a capital loss he can barely use ($3,000/year against regular income). Total realistic value from selling: **~$14M**.

Donating gives him a tax write-off worth $2-9M, 14% ownership in a $147M company worth $20M at Year 5, and a reason to get out of bed. Total value: **$22-29M**.

```
SELLING:
  $11.9M cash + ~$2.4M in tax savings from capital loss
  = ~$14M total
  + a story about losing money in his divorce

DONATING:
  $0 cash + $2-9M tax write-off + 14% of a $147M business ($20M)
  = $22-29M total
  + a story about launching a global healing movement
```

It's not even close.

## How It Works

```
STEP 1:  Seller donates the property to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
            |
STEP 2:  He gets a charitable tax deduction worth $14-22M
         (based on an independent appraisal — NOT his $28M cost)
            |
STEP 3:  Tax savings: $2-9M over 6 years
         (depends on his income — higher income = bigger savings)
            |
STEP 4:  SEPARATELY, he gets 14% equity in our operating company
         (for advisory services, expertise, and being part of the team)
            |
STEP 5:  The nonprofit owns the property. We lease it. We operate.
         He's a Founding Steward with a seat at the table.
            |
STEP 6:  We can buy him out at Fair Market Value at any time.
         He gets liquidity. We get consolidation. Everyone wins.
```

## What 14% Is Worth — Year by Year

| Year | Enterprise Value | His 14% | What's Happening |
|------|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $29,000,000 | $4,060,000 | Building + first guests |
| Year 2 | $55,000,000 | $7,700,000 | Ramping to capacity |
| Year 3 | $87,000,000 | $12,180,000 | Full operations + expansion planning |
| Year 4 | $110,000,000 | $15,400,000 | Brand established + licensing |
| Year 5 | $147,000,000 | **$20,580,000** | Global platform + multiple revenue streams |

His property becomes $20M in equity. That's not a loss. That's a 70%+ return on the market price — plus the tax savings on top.

---

## Why 14%

```
His property (market value):          ~$12,000,000
We value it at:                       $20,000,000 (through equity)
14% of our Year 5 value ($147M):     $20,580,000 ✓

Not 25% — because $36.75M overvalues a $12M property by 3x.
Not 10% — because $14.7M doesn't clear the market price by enough.
14% = $20M. Clean. Fair. Generous. Defensible.
```

## What the Seller Gets

```
SELLER gets:
  Tax write-off -------> $2M to $9M in saved taxes (over 6 years)
  14% of OpCo ---------> Worth $20M at Year 5
  Advisory role --------> $50K/year + annual retreat stay
  Buyout option --------> We buy him out at FMV whenever we're ready
  Purpose -------------> Founding Steward of a healing center
  Legacy --------------> His name on the wall. His property changes lives.
                         ---------
                         TOTAL: $22M to $29M+
                         vs. $14M from a sale
```

**What the seller gets (plain English):**
- A tax deduction that could save him $2-9M depending on his income
- 14% ownership in a business projected to be worth $147M in 5 years
- A title, a role, quarterly calls, and an annual visit to his property
- A guaranteed buyout at fair value whenever we choose to exercise it
- The most powerful personal story he'll ever tell

**What we get:**
- The property at zero acquisition cost (no $10-12M capital raise needed)
- Only need $5M for operations (instead of $15-17M)
- 86% of the operating company
- Full voting control — his 14% is non-voting
- Buyout option — we can consolidate to 100% anytime at FMV
- A seller who's now our most powerful advocate
- All IP stays protected in our Cayman entity — untouched

**The pitch to the seller:**
> "The market values your property at $12 million. We value it at $20 million — because we know what it's going to become. Your $20 million comes as 14% of everything we build. Plus a multi-million dollar tax write-off on top. This isn't a sale. This is your legacy."

**Who this works for:** A seller who wants purpose. Who built something with his hands and can't stomach watching it get flipped into condos. Who said out loud: "I need more purpose." This is that purpose.

---

## The Buyout Clause

We can buy his 14% at any time. Our option, not his.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Who triggers** | Founders only |
| **Price** | Fair Market Value at time of buyout |
| **FMV method** | Independent valuation or formula (trailing EBITDA x agreed multiple) |
| **Payment** | Cash, or 50% cash + 50% over 12 months |
| **Notice** | 60 days written notice |
| **Earliest** | After Year 1 |

**What this looks like:**
- Year 2: Buy him out at ~$7.7M
- Year 3: Buy him out at ~$12.2M
- Year 5: Buy him out at ~$20.6M
- Or never — let him ride

We control the timing. He gets fair value whenever we move.

## The $28M Write-Off Question

**Can he write off the full $28M he invested?**

Probably not. The IRS doesn't care what he paid. The charitable deduction is based on what the property is **worth today** — determined by an independent appraiser.

```
What he paid:            $28,000,000  ← doesn't matter for the deduction
What it's listed at:     $11,900,000  ← the floor
What an appraiser says:  $14-22M     ← THIS is the deduction
```

**Why the appraisal could be higher than $11.9M:**
- The listing price reflects a divorce fire sale — not true market value
- Replacement cost to rebuild this property today: $20M+
- Income potential as a wellness retreat: supports $15-25M valuation
- Take it off the market, wait 60-90 days, get a proper appraisal

**Realistic range:** $15-22M. We target the high end with a top-tier appraiser.

---

## The Tax Write-Off — How Fast He Uses It

The deduction is limited to **30% of his annual income**. Whatever he can't use in Year 1 carries forward for 5 more years (6 years total). After that, anything unused is gone.

**If he makes $15M/year** (best case):

| Year | Deduction Used | Tax Saved | Running Total |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $1,890,000 |
| 2 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $3,780,000 |
| 3 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $5,670,000 |
| 4 | $4,500,000 | $1,890,000 | $7,560,000 |
| 5 | $4,000,000 | $1,680,000 | **$9,240,000** |
| | **$22M used — nothing wasted** | | |

**If he makes $3M/year** (worst case):

| Year | Deduction Used | Tax Saved | Running Total |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $315,000 |
| 2 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $630,000 |
| 3 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $945,000 |
| 4 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $1,260,000 |
| 5 | $900,000 | $315,000 | $1,575,000 |
| 6 | $900,000 | $315,000 | **$1,890,000** |
| | **$5.4M used — $8.6M wasted** | | |

**Bottom line:** His income determines how much of the write-off he actually gets to use. Higher income = more savings. But even in the worst case, the equity makes the deal worth it.

---

## Best Case vs. Worst Case vs. Selling

| | Sell for $11.9M | Donate (Worst Case) | Donate (Best Case) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cash in hand** | $11,900,000 | $0 | $0 |
| **Tax savings** | ~$2,400,000 | ~$2,400,000 | ~$9,200,000 |
| **14% OpCo equity (Yr 5)** | $0 | $20,580,000 | $20,580,000 |
| **Advisory comp** | $0 | $250,000 | $250,000 |
| **Total 5-year value** | **~$14,000,000** | **~$23,000,000** | **~$30,000,000** |
| **vs. selling** | — | +$9M more | +$16M more |
| **Purpose** | None | Full | Full |
| **His story** | "Sold at a loss" | "Built a healing center" | "Built a healing center" |

Even in the worst case, the donation deal is worth **$9M more than selling**. The equity is the engine. The tax write-off is the cherry on top.

---

## The Card in the Back Pocket

If he hesitates, we have a sweetener we don't show upfront:

**50% of profits above a threshold.**

```
IF our EBITDA exceeds $15M in any year:
  Seller gets 50% of everything above $15M
  Capped at $10M total over 5 years

Example:
  Year 3: $15.4M EBITDA → $220K to seller
  Year 4: $18.1M EBITDA → $1.55M to seller
  Year 5: $20.3M EBITDA → $2.65M to seller
  Total: ~$4.4M extra
```

**Only play this card if he's on the fence.** Start with the base deal. This is the closer.

## The Initiation: Bring the Medicine to Him

Before any numbers. Before any term sheet. Before any pitch.

We bring the ibogaine experience to his property. Full medical team. Full ceremony. On his land, in rooms he built.

**Why:**
- He *feels* what we're building instead of hearing about it
- He experiences transformation in his own home — the property becomes sacred to him in a new way
- Post-journey, he's in a state of clarity, openness, and purpose
- The pitch isn't theoretical anymore — he has a direct reference

**The sequence:**
1. Visit. Build relationship. Share the vision. No numbers.
2. Invite him to experience the medicine. On his property.
3. After integration — share the donation concept.
4. Present the one-term offer.
5. Send $100K deposit on verbal agreement.

---

## The One Thing That Kills This Deal

**If he's not a US taxpayer, the tax write-off doesn't work.** The entire charitable deduction is a US tax benefit. No US taxes = no deduction = no tax savings.

If the write-off doesn't work, pivot to the **Property-for-Equity deal** (no donation, no nonprofit, just property for 14% equity). Same $20M outcome — just without the tax savings on top.

Other things that make it harder (but don't kill it):
- Marital property → need divorce court approval
- Debt on the property → must be paid off first
- Low income → wastes part of the deduction
- No aligned nonprofit → need to form one (3-12 months)

None of those are fatal. They just take time and money to solve.

---

## What We Need to Find Out

Before we present this to him, we need to know:

1. **Is he a US taxpayer?** (Donation deal or equity-only deal?)
2. **What does he make per year?** (Determines how much of the write-off he can use)
3. **Is the property 100% his?** (If marital, divorce court has to approve)
4. **Is there a mortgage?** (Must be paid off before donation)
5. **What's Travis's 501(c)(3)?** (Mission, status, board — has to be the right fit)

Get those five answers and we can dial this in precisely.

## Donation Deal vs. Property-for-Equity Deal

| | Donation Deal | Property-for-Equity Deal |
|---|---|---|
| **Property goes to** | 501(c)(3) nonprofit | Our RE entity directly |
| **Tax write-off** | $2-9M+ | None |
| **Equity** | 14% OpCo ($20M at Yr 5) | 14% OpCo ($20M at Yr 5) |
| **Buyout clause** | Yes — FMV anytime | Yes — FMV anytime |
| **Total 5-year value** | $22-29M+ | $20M+ |
| **Complexity** | Higher (nonprofit, appraisal, IRS) | Lower (equity agreement only) |
| **Best for** | US taxpayer with high income | Non-US taxpayer or simpler deal |
| **His story** | "Donated to launch a healing movement" | "Invested my property into a $147M company" |

**The donation deal is the premium offer.** More value, better story, bigger tax benefit. But if the donation mechanics don't work (not a US taxpayer, no aligned nonprofit, etc.), the property-for-equity deal gets the same $20M outcome with less complexity.

---

**Bottom line:** Both deals give him $20M in equity. The donation deal adds $2-9M in tax savings on top. Either way, it's better than selling for $11.9M. We get the property, he gets purpose and equity, and we can buy him out whenever we want.
