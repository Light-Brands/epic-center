# The Equity Conversion Deal

**We buy the property for $11.9M. $2M cash at closing. The remaining $9.9M converts into 15% equity in the Real Estate Company + 15% equity in the Operating Company. No interest. No debt. Pure equity conversion. His 15% is projected to be worth $22M in 5 years. We can buy him out at Year 5 over 24–36 months. Total value: $24M+ vs. $14M from a straight sale.**

---

## Why This Structure — Not a Straight Sale?

He paid $28M. He's selling for $11.9M. That's a $16M loss no matter how you cut it.

Selling gives him $11.9M cash and a capital loss he can barely use ($3,000/year against regular income). Total realistic value from selling: **~$14M**.

Our deal gives him $2M cash at closing, 15% ownership in two companies projected to reach $147M at Year 5 (his 15% = $22M), and a reason to get out of bed. Total value: **$24M+**.

```
STRAIGHT SALE:
  $11.9M cash + ~$2.4M in tax savings from capital loss
  = ~$14M total
  + a story about losing money in his divorce

EQUITY CONVERSION DEAL:
  $2M cash + 15% Real Estate Co + 15% Operating Co ($22M at Year 5)
  = $24M+ total
  + a story about launching a global healing movement
```

It's not even close.

## The Structure: $11.9M Purchase Price

```
PURCHASE PRICE:   $11,900,000

PAID AS:
  $2,000,000 -----> Cash at closing (immediate liquidity)
  $9,900,000 -----> Converted into equity:
                      • 15% equity in Real Estate Company (TE RE Mexico)
                      • 15% equity in Operating Company (TE Ops Mexico)

NOT seller financing.
NOT structured debt.
NOT a note with interest.
NO interest is paid on the $9.9M balance.

This is a full equity conversion — $9.9M in value exchanged for
ownership stakes in two operating entities.
```

---

## Two Companies, Clear Separation

### Real Estate Company (TE RE Mexico)
- Owns the physical property
- Captures asset appreciation
- Seller gets **15% equity** — participates in property value growth

### Operating Company (TE Ops Mexico)
- Runs the business (clinical operations, guests, revenue)
- Captures operating profit and enterprise value
- Seller gets **15% equity** — participates in business growth

**Why separate?** Clean separation protects the asset from operational risk. Each entity has its own valuation trajectory. The seller benefits from both.

---

## The $5M Operational Investment

Separately, we're committing **$5 million in operational capital** into the Operating Company:

- Medical buildout and clinical infrastructure
- Staff recruitment and training
- Technology and guest experience systems
- Marketing, brand launch, guest acquisition
- Working capital through ramp-up

This is NOT part of the $11.9M purchase price. This is additional capital invested to build the operation on the foundation the seller created.

---

## What 15% Is Worth: Year by Year

*Enterprise values below reflect the combined Mexico operation (TE Ops Mexico + TE RE Mexico).*

| Year | Mexico Enterprise Value | His 15% | What's Happening |
|------|------------------------|---------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $29,000,000 | $4,350,000 | Building + first guests |
| Year 2 | $55,000,000 | $8,250,000 | Ramping to capacity |
| Year 3 | $87,000,000 | $13,050,000 | Full operations + at capacity |
| Year 4 | $110,000,000 | $16,500,000 | Brand established + training programs |
| Year 5 | $147,000,000 | **$22,050,000** | Mature operation + multiple revenue streams |

His $9.9M equity conversion becomes $22M in ownership value. That's a 122% return on the converted amount, plus $2M cash in hand from day one.

---

## The $22M Year 5 Projection Logic

The $147M combined enterprise value at Year 5 is driven by:

- Revenue ramp from initial guest cohorts to full capacity
- Multiple revenue streams: clinical programs, extended stays, training, licensing
- Asset appreciation as purpose-built medical wellness facility
- Brand premium from first-mover advantage
- Operating leverage: fixed-cost infrastructure with scaling revenue

His 15% of $147M = **$22,050,000**.

---

## Why 15% + 15%

```
His property (market value):              $11,900,000
Cash he receives at closing:              $2,000,000
Value converted to equity:                $9,900,000
15% of our Year 5 value ($147M):         $22,050,000 ✓

The $9.9M equity conversion grows to $22M — a 122% return.

Not 25% because $36.75M overvalues a $9.9M conversion by 3.7x.
Not 10% because $14.7M barely clears the converted amount.
15% + 15% = $22M. Clean. Fair. Generous. Defensible.
```

## What the Seller Gets

```
SELLER gets:
  Cash at closing -------> $2,000,000 (immediate liquidity)
  15% Real Estate Co ----> Participation in asset appreciation
  15% Operating Co ------> Participation in operating growth
  Combined equity (Yr 5) > Worth $22M at Year 5
  Advisory role ---------> $50K/year + annual retreat stay
  Buyout option ---------> Year 5 buyout over 24–36 months with interest
  Purpose --------------> Founding Steward of a healing center
  Legacy ---------------> His name on the wall. His property changes lives.
                           ---------
                           TOTAL: $24M+
                           vs. $14M from a sale
```

**What the seller gets (plain English):**
- $2 million cash at closing — immediate liquidity
- 15% ownership in the Real Estate Company — participates in asset value growth
- 15% ownership in the Operating Company — participates in business growth
- Combined equity projected to be worth $22M at Year 5
- A title, a role, quarterly calls, and an annual visit to his property
- A Year 5 buyout option at fair value, paid over 24–36 months with interest
- The most powerful personal story he'll ever tell

**What we get:**
- The property for $2M cash + equity (no $12M capital raise needed)
- Only need $5M for operations (instead of $17M+)
- 85% of both the Real Estate Company and the Operating Company
- Full voting control. His 15% is non-voting in both entities
- Year 5 buyout option. We can consolidate to 100% at FMV
- A seller who's now our most powerful advocate

**The pitch to the seller:**
> "The market values your property at $11.9 million. We'll give you $2 million cash at closing and convert the remaining $9.9 million into 15% equity in two companies — the Real Estate Company and the Operating Company. No interest. No debt. Pure ownership. Your 15% is projected to be worth $22 million in five years. This isn't seller financing. This is your seat at the table."

**Who this works for:** A seller who wants purpose. Who built something with his hands and can't stomach watching it get flipped into condos. Who said out loud: "I need more purpose." This is that purpose.

---

## The Buyout Clause

At Year 5, we can buy his 15% in both entities at fair market value, paid over **24 to 36 months with interest** on the buyout balance.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Who triggers** | Founders only |
| **Earliest exercise** | Year 5 |
| **Price** | Fair Market Value at time of buyout |
| **FMV method** | Independent valuation or formula (trailing EBITDA x agreed multiple) |
| **Payment timeline** | 24–36 months from exercise date |
| **Interest** | Interest accrues on unpaid buyout balance |
| **Notice** | 60 days written notice |

**What this looks like:**
- Year 5: Buy him out at ~$22.05M, paid over 24–36 months with interest
- Or never exercise. Let him ride

We control the timing. He gets fair value plus interest on the balance over the payment period.

---

## Optional: Donation + Tax Credit Strategy

The seller may have the option to donate a portion of his equity or property value into a qualifying charitable structure. This is **optional — not mandatory** — and is presented as an available scenario for further deal optimization.

**What it could provide:**

- **Tax credit benefits** — Charitable contribution of qualifying assets could generate meaningful tax credits or deductions
- **Strategic tax efficiency** — A donation into a 501(c)(3) or similar entity can create tax savings that compound the deal's financial value
- **Legacy positioning** — Adds a philanthropic dimension to the seller's involvement in the mission

**How it relates to the core deal:**

This option does NOT change the equity conversion structure. The $2M cash, 15% + 15% equity, and buyout terms remain intact. The donation component layers on top as an optional tax optimization strategy.

**What's needed to evaluate:**
- Is the seller a US taxpayer?
- What is his annual income? (Determines deduction utilization)
- Is there a qualifying 501(c)(3) entity available?
- Tax counsel review of specific structure and timing

*No heavy tax assumptions are made here. This scenario requires independent tax advice specific to the seller's situation.*

## Best Case vs. Worst Case vs. Selling

| | Sell for $11.9M | Equity Conversion Deal |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash at closing** | $11,900,000 | $2,000,000 |
| **15% equity value (Yr 5)** | $0 | $22,050,000 |
| **Advisory comp** | $0 | $250,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **~$14,000,000** | **$24,300,000** |
| **Optional: Donation tax savings** | N/A | +$2M to $9M (if applicable) |
| **Total with optional donation** | **~$14,000,000** | **$26M – $33M+** |
| **vs. selling** | - | +$10M to $19M more |
| **Purpose** | None | Full |
| **His story** | "Sold at a loss" | "Built a healing center" |

Even without the optional donation, the equity conversion deal is worth **$10M+ more than selling**. The equity is the engine. The donation is an optional accelerator.

---

## The Card in the Back Pocket

If he hesitates, we have a sweetener we don't show upfront:

**50% of profits above a threshold.**

```
IF our EBITDA exceeds $15M in any year:
  Seller gets 50% of everything above $15M
  Capped at $10M total over 5 years

Example:
  Year 3: $15.4M EBITDA → $220K to seller
  Year 4: $18.1M EBITDA → $1.55M to seller
  Year 5: $20.3M EBITDA → $2.65M to seller
  Total: ~$4.4M extra
```

**Only play this card if he's on the fence.** Start with the base deal. This is the closer.

---

## The Initiation: Bring the Medicine to Him

Before any numbers. Before any term sheet. Before any pitch.

We bring the ibogaine experience to his property. Full medical team. Full ceremony. On his land, in rooms he built.

**Why:**
- He *feels* what we're building instead of hearing about it
- He experiences transformation in his own home. The property becomes sacred to him in a new way
- Post-journey, he's in a state of clarity, openness, and purpose
- The pitch isn't theoretical anymore. He has a direct reference

**The sequence:**
1. Visit. Build relationship. Share the vision. No numbers.
2. Invite him to experience the medicine. On his property.
3. After integration, share the equity conversion concept.
4. Present the one-term offer.
5. Send $100K deposit on verbal agreement.

---

## The One Thing That Kills This Deal

**If the seller doesn't believe in the vision.** The equity conversion only works if the seller sees the upside. If he just wants cash, the $2M at closing won't compete with $11.9M from a straight sale.

Other things that make it harder (but don't kill it):
- Marital property → need divorce court approval
- Debt on the property → must be paid off or assumed at closing
- He's impatient → equity is a long game; he needs to buy into Year 5
- No aligned nonprofit → only matters for the optional donation scenario

None of those are fatal. They just take time and alignment to solve.

---

## What We Need to Find Out

Before we present this to him, we need to know:

1. **Is the property 100% his?** (If marital, divorce court has to approve)
2. **Is there a mortgage?** (Must be addressed at closing)
3. **What's his appetite for equity vs. cash?** (Determines how hard we lean on the vision)
4. **Is he a US taxpayer?** (Only matters for the optional donation scenario)
5. **What does he make per year?** (Only matters for donation deduction utilization)

Get those answers and we can dial this in precisely.

---

## Key Distinction: This Is NOT Seller Financing

| | Seller Financing | Our Equity Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| **What seller holds** | A note (debt instrument) | Equity (ownership stakes) |
| **Interest** | Yes, interest accrues | No interest on $9.9M |
| **Risk** | Default risk on payments | Enterprise risk (upside + downside) |
| **Upside** | Capped at note amount + interest | Uncapped — grows with enterprise value |
| **Seller's role** | Creditor | Owner / Partner |
| **Relationship** | Adversarial (debtor vs. creditor) | Aligned (shared upside) |
| **Tax treatment** | Interest income | Capital gains on equity |

The seller is not carrying a note. The seller is not financing the deal. The seller is converting $9.9M of value into ownership in two companies. This is a fundamentally different structure with fundamentally different upside.

---

**Bottom line:** $11.9M purchase price. $2M cash at closing. $9.9M converted into 15% equity in the Real Estate Company + 15% equity in the Operating Company. No interest. No debt. His 15% is projected to be worth $22M at Year 5. Year 5 optional buyout over 24–36 months with interest. Optional donation strategy layers on top for additional tax efficiency. Either way, it's worth $10M+ more than a straight sale. We get the property, he gets purpose and equity in both entities, and we can buy him out when we're ready.
