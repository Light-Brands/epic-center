## Total Technology Envelope Strategy

**Techify Everything — The Platform Is the Brain, the Facility Is the Body**

**Date:** February 2026
**Classification:** STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL - Founders Only
**Version:** 0.1 DRAFT - For Strategic Discussion
**Prepared by:** AI-Assisted Strategy Analysis

---

> **DISCLAIMER**: This document explores the maximum extent to which technology can become the economic center of gravity for TE's global operations. It builds on the four prior strategy documents and pushes the platform model to its logical extreme. Every strategy must be validated by qualified counsel — particularly Mexican labor law (the 2021 outsourcing reform is a critical constraint), international tax, transfer pricing, and IP specialists. This is not legal or tax advice.

---

## TL;DR

**The idea:** Make the TE platform the center of everything — every clinical protocol, every housekeeping task, every meal plan, every staff schedule, every guest interaction, every payment. The Mexican facility (and every future location) becomes a cost-plus service provider that employs the hands. The Netherlands tech entity owns the brain.

**The structure:**
- **Panama PIF** → owns everything personally, 0% tax
- **UK HoldCo** → dividend pass-through only (~$50K/yr to maintain), 0% WHT out to Panama
- **TE Global Technology B.V. (Netherlands)** → single entity that owns all IP, platform, clinical AI, brand, and guest relationships. Innovation Box: **9% tax** on qualifying IP income, 25.8% on the rest. Blended **13-16%** depending on how much IP you patent/register
- **Local OpCos** (Mexico, Costa Rica, Jamaica, etc.) → employ staff, operate facility, earn cost + 8-12% margin. Taxed locally on minimal profit

**Why Netherlands, not UK?**
- NL Innovation Box qualifies **copyrighted software** (no patents needed for companies under EUR 37.5M). UK Patent Box requires patents.
- NL headline rate (25.8%) is REFIPRE-safe for Mexico — same as UK's 25%
- NL is in the EU → **0% withholding tax** on royalties to/from EU locations (Portugal, Spain, Greece, Italy). Post-Brexit UK pays 5-10%.
- One entity instead of two = simpler, cheaper (~$400K/yr less substance cost)

**The hard wall:** Mexico's 2021 outsourcing reform bans the platform from employing Mexican workers. All on-site staff must be employed by the Mexican OpCo. But the platform providing operational intelligence via SaaS (scheduling, task dispatch, payroll calculation, quality control) is legal — it's Cloudbeds, not a staffing agency.

**The numbers (Year 5, single Tulum location):**
- Total HC revenue: $35.5M
- Platform extracts ~30-38% through stacked intercompany charges
- NL tech entity revenue: ~$18.4M → tax at 13-16% blended = **$2.4-$2.9M**
- Mexico OpCo taxable profit: ~$1.8M → tax at 30% = **$0.5M**
- **Total tax: ~$3.1M (effective ~15%)** vs. ~$6.2M if all in Mexico (30%)
- **Annual savings: ~$2.7M** after substance costs

**At 10 global locations:** ~$23M/year in tax savings vs. keeping everything local.

**Critical next steps:**
1. Resolve REFIPRE question with Mexican tax counsel (headline rate vs. effective rate)
2. Incorporate TE Global Technology B.V. in Netherlands
3. Apply for WBSO R&D certificate immediately
4. Hire CTO + core engineering team in Amsterdam
5. Patent the pharmacogenomic dosing engine, brain mapping analysis, and scheduling algorithms
6. Commission Big 4 transfer pricing study

## 1. The Vision: What Does "Techify Everything" Mean? {#1-the-vision}

The prior strategy documents explored technology as a licensing product (Doc 3) and the platform as the business principal (Doc 4). This document asks a more radical question:

**What if every single function that happens at a TE location — from dosing a patient to folding towels to paying the chef — is orchestrated, managed, and controlled by the technology platform?**

The premise: if the technology is genuinely responsible for the intelligence, coordination, quality control, and operational management of every activity on-site, then the technology's share of the value creation is not 30% — it's 50-70%. And 50-70% of the value should flow to the entity that owns the technology.

### 1.1 What "Techify Everything" Looks Like

| Domain | Traditional Model | Techified Model |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Clinical protocols** | Doctor decides treatment plan | AI generates pharmacogenomic dosing protocol; doctor follows platform guidance |
| **Staff scheduling** | Manager creates weekly schedule | Platform auto-generates optimal schedules based on guest profiles, staff skills, occupancy |
| **Housekeeping** | Supervisor assigns rooms | IoT sensors detect checkout → app pushes task to nearest available housekeeper → verifies completion |
| **Kitchen/nutrition** | Chef plans menus | Platform generates personalized nutrition plans per guest; kitchen receives prep instructions via app |
| **Maintenance** | Staff reports broken items | IoT predictive maintenance alerts before failure; app dispatches technician with parts list |
| **Guest experience** | Front desk manages requests | App handles all guest communication, scheduling, preferences, complaints, upgrades |
| **Quality control** | Periodic inspections | Real-time quality scoring via IoT + guest feedback + staff performance metrics |
| **Procurement** | Manual ordering | AI-driven inventory forecasting, auto-reorder, vendor management through platform |
| **Financial operations** | Accounting team processes | Automated invoicing, expense tracking, payroll calculation, tax compliance through platform |
| **Security** | Guard staff + cameras | Biometric access control, AI-monitored surveillance, automated incident reporting |
| **Compliance** | Manual record-keeping | Automated regulatory documentation, COFEPRIS reporting, health record management |
| **Marketing/CRM** | Marketing team | AI-driven guest acquisition, personalized outreach, automated follow-up, conversion optimization |

### 1.2 The Analogy

Think of it like a Tesla factory:
- **The robots (technology)** do the sophisticated work — welding, assembly, quality control, diagnostics
- **The human workers** do the tasks that still require physical presence — loading materials, final inspection, maintenance of the robots themselves
- **Tesla** (the tech company) earns the margin. The factory workers earn wages.

In TE's model:
- **The platform** does the sophisticated work — clinical protocol generation, scheduling optimization, quality assurance, guest journey management, financial operations
- **The Mexican OpCo staff** do the tasks that require physical presence — administering treatments, cleaning rooms, cooking meals, greeting guests
- **TE Platform Ltd** earns the technology margin. Mexican OpCo earns a service delivery margin.

### 1.3 Is This Viable?

**Short answer:** Mostly yes, with one critical constraint.

**The constraint is Mexico's 2021 outsourcing reform.** The platform cannot employ or "provide" the workers. The Mexican OpCo must be the legal employer. But the platform can be the operational brain that tells every worker what to do, when, how, and at what quality standard.

This is the same model used by:
- **Marriott** franchises: Marriott's systems control everything — the franchisee employs the staff
- **McDonald's**: The corporate systems dictate every process — the franchise operator employs the workers
- **Cloudbeds / Mews / StayNtouch**: SaaS platforms that run the entire hotel — the hotel employs the staff
- **Epic Systems / Cerner**: Hospital management platforms that control clinical workflows — the hospital employs the clinicians

The technology providing operational intelligence to locally-employed staff is not outsourcing. It's SaaS.

## 2. The Hard Wall: Mexico's 2021 Outsourcing Reform {#2-the-hard-wall}

### 2.1 What Mexico Banned

In April 2021, Mexico enacted sweeping reforms to the Federal Labor Law (Ley Federal del Trabajo), the Social Security Law (Ley del Seguro Social), and the Federal Tax Code (Codigo Fiscal de la Federacion). The reform:

1. **Banned outsourcing of personnel** — No company may provide workers to perform core business activities for another entity
2. **Banned insourcing structures** — Even intra-group arrangements where a subsidiary provides workers to a parent/sibling entity for core activities are prohibited
3. **Created REPSE** (Registro de Prestadoras de Servicios Especializados u Obras Especializadas) — A mandatory registry for providers of permitted specialized services
4. **Defined "specialized services"** — Only services that are **not part of the beneficiary's core business or primary economic activity** can be outsourced

### 2.2 What This Means for TE

The Mexican OpCo's core business is operating a healing center. This means:

| Activity | Can It Be Provided by UK Entity? | Why? |
|---------|--------------------------------|------|
| Clinical treatment staff | **NO** | Core business activity — must be OpCo employees |
| Nursing / patient care | **NO** | Core business activity |
| Housekeeping | **NO** | Integral to hospitality operations (core) |
| Kitchen / F&B staff | **NO** | Integral to hospitality operations (core) |
| Front desk / reception | **NO** | Core hospitality function |
| Maintenance staff | **MAYBE** | Could be argued as specialized if REPSE-registered |
| Security | **MAYBE** | Often outsourced in Mexico (specialized service) |
| IT support (local) | **YES** | IT services are generally recognized as specialized |
| Accounting | **YES** | Professional services recognized as specialized |
| Legal | **YES** | Professional services recognized as specialized |
| Marketing | **YES** | Non-core activity |
| Technology platform services | **YES** | Software licensing is not labor outsourcing |

**The critical distinction:** Providing **workers** to perform a function is outsourcing (banned). Providing **technology** that manages how workers perform their functions is SaaS licensing (legal).

### 2.3 Penalties for Getting This Wrong

| Violation | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| Subcontracting personnel for core activities | Fine of MXN $179,240 - $4,481,000 (~$9K - $224K USD) per violation |
| Failure to register in REPSE | Same fine range |
| Tax fraud (misclassifying labor as services) | Criminal prosecution; up to 9 years imprisonment |
| IMSS/INFONAVIT evasion through outsourcing | Back taxes + penalties + surcharges (can be multiples of the amount evaded) |

### 2.4 The Safe Zone

The platform model is safe as long as:

1. **All on-site workers are employees of the Mexican OpCo** — hired, paid, insured, and managed by the Mexican entity
2. **The platform provides technology services, not personnel** — the UK entity licenses software, does not deploy workers
3. **The intercompany agreement is for technology licensing and services** — not for staff provision
4. **The Mexican OpCo has its own management structure** — local managers who make day-to-day operational decisions (even if guided by the platform)

### 3.2 Why This Is Not Outsourcing

| Test | Outsourcing (Banned) | SaaS Licensing (Legal) |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Who employs the workers? | The service provider | The client (OpCo) |
| Who pays social security? | The service provider | The client (OpCo) |
| Who has the labor relationship? | The service provider | The client (OpCo) |
| What is being provided? | Human labor | Software tools and intelligence |
| Who makes day-to-day decisions? | The service provider | The client's management |
| Is REPSE required? | Yes | No (not a labor service) |

**TE Platform Ltd provides software. Not people. This is Cloudbeds, not a staffing agency.**

## 4. Techifying Every Function: A Complete Inventory {#4-techifying-every-function}

### 4.1 Clinical Operations (Highest Value)

| Function | Technology Component (UK Platform) | Physical Component (Mexican OpCo) |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Patient intake assessment** | AI-powered questionnaire, risk scoring, pharmacogenomic interpretation | Blood draw, physical exam |
| **Treatment protocol design** | AI generates personalized protocol based on genetics, history, goals | Clinician reviews and approves |
| **Ibogaine dosing calculation** | Pharmacogenomic dosing algorithm (CYP2D6, cardiac risk factors) | Nurse administers dose |
| **Vital monitoring** | Real-time wearable data analysis, anomaly detection, alerts | Staff responds to alerts |
| **Brain mapping analysis** | EEG analysis algorithms, pattern recognition, report generation | Technician applies electrodes |
| **Progress tracking** | Daily outcome scoring, trajectory analysis, adjustment recommendations | Therapist conducts sessions |
| **Integration therapy** | AI-guided integration prompts, journaling, content delivery | Therapist provides in-person support |
| **Discharge planning** | AI generates post-care plan, subscription enrollment, follow-up scheduling | Clinician reviews with patient |

**Platform value share:** 60-70% — the clinical intelligence is the differentiator, not the physical administration. Without the pharmacogenomic platform, this is generic ibogaine therapy. With it, it is precision medicine.

### 4.2 Hospitality Operations

| Function | Technology Component | Physical Component |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Room assignment** | AI optimizes based on guest preferences, treatment schedule, accessibility needs | Staff prepares room |
| **Housekeeping scheduling** | IoT occupancy sensors + app task management; automatic dispatch when guest leaves room | Housekeepers clean rooms |
| **Housekeeping verification** | Photo verification via app; quality scoring; checklist completion tracking | Supervisor spot-checks |
| **Turndown service** | App-triggered based on guest evening schedule; personalized amenity selection | Staff delivers amenities |
| **Linen/amenity inventory** | IoT-tracked inventory; automated reorder triggers; waste analytics | Staff handles physical stock |
| **Maintenance requests** | Guest submits via app → auto-prioritized → dispatched to technician with diagnosis | Technician performs repair |
| **Predictive maintenance** | IoT sensors on HVAC, plumbing, electrical; ML models predict failures | Technician performs preventive work |

**Platform value share:** 30-40% — hospitality operations are more labor-intensive; technology optimizes but doesn't replace the physical delivery.

### 4.3 Food & Beverage

| Function | Technology Component | Physical Component |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Meal planning** | AI generates personalized nutrition plans per guest based on treatment protocol, allergies, preferences, genomic data | Chef interprets and prepares |
| **Recipe management** | Platform maintains recipe database with nutritional data, scaling, cost analysis | Kitchen follows recipes |
| **Inventory management** | AI demand forecasting, automated vendor ordering, waste tracking | Staff receives deliveries |
| **Dietary compliance** | Real-time tracking that each guest receives correct meals; allergen alerts | Kitchen staff verifies |
| **Special requests** | Guest submits via app → kitchen receives with prep instructions | Kitchen prepares |
| **Cost optimization** | AI analyzes food costs, suggests substitutions, tracks waste patterns | Chef implements suggestions |

**Platform value share:** 25-35% — food is inherently physical, but the nutritional intelligence and clinical integration adds significant IP value.

### 4.4 Guest Experience

| Function | Technology Component | Physical Component |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Pre-arrival** | 100% digital: booking, intake, travel coordination, preparation content | None |
| **Check-in** | App-based: digital key, welcome guide, schedule confirmation | Warm greeting from staff |
| **Daily schedule** | AI-optimized based on treatment plan, energy levels, weather, group dynamics | Staff facilitates activities |
| **In-stay communication** | All through app: requests, feedback, scheduling changes, information | Staff responds in-person |
| **Activity recommendations** | AI-personalized based on progress, mood tracking, peer matching | Staff leads activities |
| **Complaint resolution** | App-captured → auto-routed → SLA-tracked → resolution verified | Staff addresses in-person |
| **Checkout** | App-based: bill review, feedback, post-care enrollment | Farewell from staff |
| **Post-stay** | 100% digital: integration protocols, telemedicine, AI coaching | None |

**Platform value share:** 70-80% — the guest relationship, data, personalization, and continuity are all platform-delivered.

### 4.5 Financial Operations

| Function | Technology Component | Physical Component |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Payroll calculation** | Platform computes gross pay, deductions, IMSS/INFONAVIT contributions, ISR withholding | OpCo authorizes and disburses |
| **Payroll disbursement** | Platform generates payment files, integrates with Mexican banking | OpCo's bank processes payments |
| **Expense management** | App-based expense capture, approval workflows, budget tracking | Staff submits receipts via app |
| **Vendor payments** | Platform manages AP, auto-generates payment schedules, three-way matching | OpCo authorizes payments |
| **Guest billing** | Platform generates invoices, processes payments (Stripe UK), handles refunds | None (100% digital) |
| **Tax compliance** | Platform calculates tax obligations, generates SAT-required XMLs (CFDI) | OpCo's accountant reviews and files |
| **Financial reporting** | Platform generates real-time P&L, balance sheet, KPIs, investor reports | OpCo's controller validates |

**Platform value share:** 40-50% — financial operations are heavily automatable, but the Mexican entity must be the legal payor for Mexican obligations.

### 4.6 Workforce Management

| Function | Technology Component | Physical Component |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Scheduling** | AI-optimized schedules based on guest volume, treatment schedules, skill requirements, labor law constraints | Managers review and approve |
| **Task assignment** | Real-time task dispatch via app based on priority, location, staff availability | Staff executes tasks |
| **Time tracking** | Biometric or app-based clock-in/out; overtime alerts; attendance patterns | Staff clocks in/out |
| **Performance management** | KPI dashboards, guest satisfaction correlation, peer comparison, coaching alerts | Managers conduct reviews |
| **Training** | Platform delivers training content, tracks certifications, identifies gaps | Staff completes training |
| **Recruitment assistance** | AI screens candidates, assesses skill match, generates interview guides | Managers interview and hire |

**Platform value share:** 35-45% — scheduling and task optimization are genuinely technology-driven, but the labor relationship stays with the OpCo.

---

## 5. The Workforce Management Platform {#5-workforce-management-platform}

### 5.1 What It Does (and What It Doesn't Do)

The workforce management platform is the most sensitive component because it touches the outsourcing reform boundary. Here's the line:

**The platform DOES:**
- Generate optimized work schedules for all staff categories
- Push task assignments to staff mobile devices in real-time
- Track task completion and time spent
- Calculate payroll amounts (gross pay, deductions, contributions)
- Generate payroll files for bank processing
- Track employee certifications and training requirements
- Provide performance analytics and coaching recommendations
- Manage PTO requests and accrual tracking
- Generate IMSS/INFONAVIT/SAT compliance filings
- Alert managers to labor law issues (overtime limits, mandatory rest periods)

**The platform DOES NOT:**
- Employ any worker
- Pay any worker directly (the Mexican OpCo's bank account disburses)
- Have a labor relationship with any worker
- Hire or fire workers (Mexican OpCo managers do)
- Direct workers (the app provides task recommendations; managers authorize)
- Sign employment contracts
- Register workers with IMSS

**The analogy:** The platform is like Gusto, Rippling, or ADP for the US market — a payroll and HR SaaS platform that processes payroll, manages scheduling, and provides HR tools. The employer is the client company, not the SaaS platform.

### 5.2 Why This Matters for Tax

If the platform manages the entire operational intelligence of the facility — and the OpCo's role is reduced to employing staff and maintaining the physical property — then the platform is providing substantial value that justifies substantial fees.

**Comparable SaaS platforms and their pricing:**

| Platform | Function | Typical Pricing | Annual Cost at TE Scale |
|----------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| Cloudbeds / Mews | Full hotel PMS | $5-15/room/night | $100K-$300K/year |
| Epic Systems | Hospital management | $500K-$5M implementation + annual fees | $200K-$1M/year |
| Workday HCM | HR & payroll | $100-$200/employee/year | $30K-$60K/year |
| ServiceNow | IT & facility management | $100/user/month | $50K-$150K/year |
| Salesforce Health Cloud | Patient CRM | $300/user/month | $100K-$300K/year |
| Custom AI/ML clinical platform | No direct comparable | Priceless (proprietary) | — |

TE's platform **combines all of the above** into one integrated system. An arm's length comparison to buying each of these separately would suggest a total technology cost of **$500K-$2M+ per year** — before accounting for the proprietary clinical IP (pharmacogenomic dosing, brain mapping analysis, AI personalization) which has no direct market comparable and could command premium pricing.

---

## 6. Why the UK? (And Is It Actually the Best?) {#6-why-the-uk}

### 6.1 The REFIPRE Constraint — The Starting Point

Every jurisdiction decision starts with Mexico's REFIPRE rules. If payments to a foreign entity are treated as flowing to a "preferential tax regime" (effective rate below 22.5%), Mexico:

1. **Disallows the deduction** in Mexico (the charge cannot reduce Mexican taxable income)
2. **Imposes 40% WHT** on the payment (instead of the treaty rate)
3. **Combined impact:** ~58%+ effective rate on the payment — worse than paying 30% Mexican tax on the full amount

**This eliminates any jurisdiction with a headline corporate tax rate below 22.5%:**
- Ireland (12.5%): Eliminated
- Singapore (17%): Eliminated
- UAE (0-9%): Eliminated
- Hong Kong (16.5%): Eliminated
- Estonia (0% retained/20% distributed): Eliminated
- Cyprus (12.5%): Eliminated
- Hungary (9%): Eliminated

### 6.2 The Critical Open Question: Does Patent Box Trigger REFIPRE?

Mexico's REFIPRE definition: *"A preferential tax regime exists when an item of income is not subject to tax in a foreign jurisdiction or when the foreign effective tax rate is lower than 75% of the effective tax rate to which that item would be subject in Mexico."*

The question is: does Mexico look at:
- **(a) The jurisdiction's headline rate** (UK = 25%, which is above 22.5% → REFIPRE safe), or
- **(b) The effective rate on the specific income** (UK Patent Box = 10%, which is below 22.5% → REFIPRE triggered)

**This is the single most important open question in the entire strategy.** If the answer is (b), then every patent box / innovation box regime in the world triggers REFIPRE, and the entire IP structuring strategy must be redesigned.

**Arguments for (a) — headline rate:**
- The UK is not a "preferential tax regime" jurisdiction — it's a 25% rate OECD member
- Patent Box is a standard, OECD-compliant incentive (passed BEPS Action 5 review)
- SAT's REFIPRE rules target tax havens and artificial structures, not mainstream OECD incentives
- Precedent: Mexico does not treat the US as a REFIPRE jurisdiction despite many US states having 0% state corporate tax

**Arguments for (b) — effective rate on income:**
- The statutory language says "effective tax rate" on the specific income
- 10% is clearly below 22.5%
- SAT has been increasingly aggressive in applying REFIPRE broadly
- Mexico confirmed in 2018 that the US could qualify as REFIPRE for certain types of income under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

**Counsel must resolve this before implementation.** If the answer is (b), the structure needs modification (see Section 8).

### 6.3 Jurisdiction Comparison Table

| Jurisdiction | Headline Rate | IP Box Rate | REFIPRE Safe (headline)? | REFIPRE Safe (effective)? | Mexico Treaty? | Royalty WHT (treaty) | Substance Cost | Talent Pool | Reputation |
|-------------|--------------|------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **UK** | 25% | 10% (Patent Box) | Yes | **No** (10% < 22.5%) | Yes | 10% | $500K-$1.5M/yr | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Netherlands** | 25.8% | 9% (Innovation Box) | Yes | **No** (9% < 22.5%) | Yes | 10% | $400K-$1M/yr | Very Good | Very Good |
| **Belgium** | 25% | 3.75% (IID) | Yes | **No** (3.75% < 22.5%) | Yes | 10% | $300K-$800K/yr | Good | Good |
| **Luxembourg** | 24.94% | ~5.2% (IP Box) | Yes | **No** (5.2% < 22.5%) | Yes | 10% | $400K-$1M/yr | Moderate | Good (financial) |
| **France** | 25% | 10% (IP Box) | Yes | **No** (10% < 22.5%) | Yes | 10% (estimated) | $500K-$1.5M/yr | Excellent | Good |
| **Switzerland** | ~14-20% (cantonal) | ~8-12% (Patent Box) | Depends on canton | **No** | Yes | 10% | $600K-$2M/yr | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Malta** | 35% | ~1.75% (refund) | Yes | **No** (1.75% < 22.5%) | No treaty | 25% (no treaty) | $200K-$500K/yr | Limited | Moderate |
| **Ireland** | 12.5% | 6.25% (KDB) | **No** (12.5% < 22.5%) | **No** | Yes | 10% | $400K-$1M/yr | Excellent | Good |
| **Singapore** | 17% | 5% (IDI) | **No** (17% < 22.5%) | **No** | Yes | 10% | $300K-$1M/yr | Good | Excellent |

### 6.4 Why UK Is Still the Best (on Balance)

Despite the REFIPRE uncertainty, the UK scores highest overall:

1. **REFIPRE safe on headline rate** — 25% is above 22.5%. If REFIPRE is judged on headline rate (the more likely interpretation for OECD countries), the UK is clear.

2. **10% Patent Box is the optimal "not too low"** — Belgium's 3.75% and Malta's 1.75% look suspicious even if technically compliant. UK's 10% is conservative enough to defend.

3. **Best tech talent pool** — London is a global tech hub. Finding a CTO, engineers, product managers, and data scientists is realistic. Try finding a pharmacogenomic AI team in Luxembourg.

4. **Mexico-UK treaty is strong** — 10% WHT on royalties, 0% on dividends (conditions apply), and a clear PE definition. The treaty is well-established and tested.

5. **0% outbound dividend WHT** — Income flows from UK to Panama PIF with no UK tax on distributions. This is not true for most other jurisdictions.

6. **OECD BEPS compliant** — UK Patent Box passed the BEPS Action 5 review under the Modified Nexus Approach. It requires real R&D substance in the UK.

7. **Investor credibility** — US and Canadian investors understand and trust UK corporate structures. "Our tech is in London" is more credible than "Our tech is in Malta" or "Our tech is in Luxembourg."

8. **English language, common law** — Contract enforcement, IP protection, and dispute resolution are world-class. Companies House is transparent and efficient.

### 6.5 When to Consider an Alternative

**Use the Netherlands instead of (or alongside) the UK if:**
- The 9% Innovation Box rate is preferred (1% lower than UK)
- The company wants to co-locate with other tech operations (Amsterdam is a major hub)
- The Innovation Box's broader qualifying criteria are advantageous (includes copyrighted software without patent requirement in some cases)

**Use Belgium if:**
- Maximum IP deduction is the priority (3.75% effective)
- The company has or wants to establish R&D operations in Belgium
- REFIPRE is judged on headline rate (Belgium is also 25%)

**Use Switzerland if:**
- The founders plan to relocate to Switzerland (combines personal and corporate benefits)
- Certain cantons offer combined rates of 11-14% with patent box
- The premium reputation justifies the higher substance costs

## 7. Jurisdiction Deep Dive: The Full Comparison {#7-jurisdiction-deep-dive}

### 7.1 UK — Patent Box (Recommended Primary)

**How it works:**
- UK corporation tax rate: 25% (April 2023 onward)
- Patent Box reduces the effective rate to **10%** on qualifying IP income
- Qualifying IP: patents, supplementary protection certificates, certain regulatory data exclusivities
- **Copyrighted software qualifies only if it is novel and contributes to a patented process** — standalone software may not qualify unless patented

**BEPS Nexus Approach:**
- Benefits are proportional to qualifying R&D expenditure performed by the company (or UK subcontractors)
- Outsourced R&D to related parties: limited by nexus fraction (with 30% uplift)
- Formula: Qualifying expenditure / Total expenditure × 1.3 (capped at 1.0) = nexus ratio
- To maximize benefit: **majority of R&D should be performed by UK employees or UK-based contractors**

**Substance requirements:**
- Minimum: UK-resident employees performing qualifying R&D
- CTO or technical lead should be UK-based
- Core engineering team should be UK-employed (3-5 minimum)
- R&D decisions and direction must come from the UK
- Board meetings held in the UK; strategic decisions made in the UK

**Costs:**
- UK corporation tax filing: $5K-$15K/year
- Patent Box election and computation: $15K-$30K/year (specialist adviser)
- Patent filing and maintenance: $10K-$50K/year (depending on portfolio)
- Staff costs: $350K-$1M/year (CTO + 3-4 engineers in the UK)
- Office: $50K-$150K/year (London serviced office or tech hub)
- **Total substance cost: $500K-$1.5M/year**

### 7.2 Netherlands — Innovation Box (Strong Alternative)

**How it works:**
- Netherlands corporate tax: 25.8% (on profits above EUR 200K)
- Innovation Box reduces the effective rate to **9%** on qualifying IP income
- Qualifying IP: patents, plant breeders' rights, **software protected by copyright** (broader than UK), WBSO-approved R&D
- Software companies often find the Netherlands easier to qualify for because **copyrighted software** qualifies directly (no patent required)

**Key advantage for TE:** The TE platform is primarily software, not a patented invention. If the software doesn't qualify for UK Patent Box (because it's not patented), it may still qualify for Dutch Innovation Box (because copyrighted software is eligible).

**Substance requirements:**
- Similar to UK — BEPS nexus approach applies
- Must have WBSO declaration (R&D certificate from Netherlands Enterprise Agency)
- Dutch-based R&D personnel required
- Application process is more structured but well-documented

**Costs:**
- Dutch corporate tax filing: $10K-$20K/year
- Innovation Box application and maintenance: $15K-$30K/year
- WBSO application: $5K-$10K/year
- Staff costs: $300K-$900K/year (Amsterdam tech salaries are slightly lower than London)
- Office: $40K-$120K/year
- **Total substance cost: $400K-$1.2M/year**

### 7.3 Belgium — Innovation Income Deduction (Lowest Rate)

**How it works:**
- Belgian corporate tax: 25% (small companies: 20% on first EUR 100K)
- Innovation Income Deduction: 85% deduction of qualifying IP income
- Effective rate: **3.75%** on qualifying IP income
- Qualifying IP: patents, copyrighted software, plant variety rights, orphan drug exclusivity

**Key advantage:** Lowest effective rate in a REFIPRE-safe jurisdiction (headline 25%).

**Key disadvantage:** Belgium is less known for tech companies; the talent pool for specialized health-tech is smaller; the innovation ecosystem is less developed than UK or Netherlands.

**Substance requirements:**
- Belgian-based R&D activities
- BELSPO (Federal Science Policy Office) guidelines for qualifying R&D
- Personnel performing development in Belgium
- Nexus fraction applies

**Costs:**
- Belgian corporate tax filing: $10K-$25K/year
- IID application and maintenance: $15K-$25K/year
- Staff costs: $250K-$700K/year (Brussels/Leuven tech salaries)
- Office: $30K-$80K/year
- **Total substance cost: $350K-$900K/year**

### 7.4 The REFIPRE Hedge: Mixed-Rate Structure

If REFIPRE is judged on effective rate (the aggressive SAT interpretation), the platform entity could adopt a **mixed-income model** where some income qualifies for Patent Box (10%) and some is taxed at the standard rate (25%), resulting in a blended effective rate above 22.5%.

| Income Type | Amount | Tax Rate | Tax Paid |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Patent Box qualifying (SaaS, clinical IP) | $5M | 10% | $500K |
| Standard rate (management fees, brand, data) | $5M | 25% | $1.25M |
| **Blended** | **$10M** | **17.5%** | **$1.75M** |

At 17.5% blended, this is still below 22.5%. You'd need roughly:

- 60% of income at standard rate (25%) + 40% at Patent Box (10%) = **19%** — still below
- 80% at standard (25%) + 20% at Patent Box (10%) = **22%** — still below
- 85% at standard (25%) + 15% at Patent Box (10%) = **22.75%** — just above

**This means:** If REFIPRE is judged on effective rate, you'd need to keep Patent Box income to ~15% of total UK entity income, which largely defeats the purpose.

**The better solution:** Get a ruling from SAT (consulta vinculante) confirming that UK headline rate (25%) is the relevant measure, not the effective rate on specific income. Alternatively, seek an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) that pre-agrees the transfer pricing methodology.

## 8. The Recommended Structure: Dual-Jurisdiction Tech Engine {#8-recommended-structure}

### 8.1 Why Dual Jurisdiction?

Rather than putting all eggs in one basket, a dual-jurisdiction approach provides:

1. **REFIPRE insurance** — if one jurisdiction's IP incentive triggers REFIPRE, the other still works
2. **Function separation** — different types of IP in different optimized jurisdictions
3. **Global expansion flexibility** — each jurisdiction brings different treaty networks
4. **Risk distribution** — not dependent on any single country's policy changes

### 8.3 Why This Structure Is Stronger

| Feature | Single UK Entity (Docs 3-4) | Dual UK + NL Entity (This Doc) |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| REFIPRE risk | Medium (if Patent Box triggers REFIPRE) | Low (UK platform at 25% is inarguably safe; NL clinical IP has separate defense) |
| Patent Box qualification | Uncertain for platform/booking fees | Eliminated — platform at standard rate; only clinical IP in Innovation Box |
| Effective tax rate | 10% if all qualifies | 15-18% blended (higher but safer) |
| Substance requirement | All in UK | Split — operational platform team in UK, clinical AI/R&D team in NL |
| Talent access | UK only | UK (platform) + Netherlands (clinical AI / healthtech — strong ecosystem) |
| Global expansion | UK treaties only | UK treaties + Dutch treaties (broader coverage) |
| Audit defense | Complex (why is booking commission at 10%?) | Simple (platform at 25%, only genuine clinical IP at 9%) |

### 8.4 The Tax Math: Dual Structure

**Year 5 Revenue Split:**

| Revenue Stream | Amount | Entity | Tax Rate | Tax |
|---------------|--------|--------|----------|-----|
| Platform commission (15% of HC revenue) | $5,319,150 | UK Platform | 25% | $1,329,788 |
| SaaS + workforce mgmt + ops platform fees | $1,200,000 | UK Platform | 25% | $300,000 |
| Brand license (3%) | $1,063,830 | UK Platform | 25% | $265,958 |
| Management fee (2%) | $709,220 | UK Platform | 25% | $177,305 |
| Villa marketplace commission | $2,640,000 | UK Platform | 25% | $660,000 |
| **UK Platform subtotal** | **$10,932,200** | **UK** | **25%** | **$2,733,050** |
| | | | | |
| Clinical IP royalty (5% of HC revenue) | $1,773,050 | NL Technology | 9% | $159,575 |
| AI model & data analytics fees | $600,000 | NL Technology | 9% | $54,000 |
| Post-care subscriptions (clinical content) | $5,137,500 | NL Technology | 9% | $462,375 |
| **NL Technology subtotal** | **$7,510,550** | **NL** | **9%** | **$675,950** |
| | | | | |
| OpCo service delivery margin | $1,336,000 | Mexico | 30% | $400,800 |
| PropCo construction margin | $880,000 | Mexico | 30% | $264,000 |
| **Mexico subtotal** | **$2,216,000** | **Mexico** | **30%** | **$664,800** |
| | | | | |
| **TOTAL** | **$20,658,750** | | | **$4,073,800** |
| **Blended effective rate** | | | **19.7%** | |

**Compare:**
- All-in-Mexico: ~30% → ~$6.2M tax on the same pre-tax income
- Single UK Patent Box (Doc 4): ~13-18% → ~$2.3M (but REFIPRE risk)
- Dual UK + NL (this doc): **~19.7%** → **~$4.1M** (REFIPRE safe)

**The dual structure saves ~$2.1M/year vs. all-Mexico at Year 5, with significantly lower REFIPRE risk than the single UK Patent Box model.**

## 9. Revenue Attribution: What Is the Technology Actually Worth? {#9-revenue-attribution}

### 9.1 The Core Question

If you're claiming that 50-70% of the value comes from technology, you need to prove it. A SAT auditor will ask: "Why should a software platform earn more than the medical professionals delivering life-changing treatment?"

### 9.2 The Value Chain Analysis

| Value Component | Who Creates It | % of Total Value | Justification |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Clinical protocol design** | NL Technology (AI) + OpCo clinicians | 25% | Pharmacogenomic dosing, personalized treatment plan — the IP, not the hands |
| **Guest acquisition & matching** | UK Platform | 15% | Marketing, booking engine, intake assessment, conversion optimization |
| **Operational orchestration** | UK Platform | 10% | Scheduling, task management, quality control, supply chain |
| **Physical service delivery** | Mexican OpCo | 25% | Medical treatments, meals, housekeeping, facility — the hands, not the brain |
| **Post-care continuity** | NL Technology | 10% | Integration protocols, AI coaching, telemedicine — 100% digital |
| **Brand & trust** | UK Platform | 8% | The name, reputation, and guarantee that brings HNW clients |
| **Data intelligence** | NL Technology | 7% | Outcome data, optimization loops, research value |

**Technology (UK + NL combined): 75% of value**
**Physical operations (Mexico): 25% of value**

### 9.3 Supporting Evidence

**1. Comparable business models:**
- Marriott earns 3-6% royalty + 3-5% management fee + system charges from franchisees (8-13% of gross revenue) — and Marriott doesn't provide clinical IP
- Oracle/Cerner charges hospitals $500K-$5M+ for clinical management software
- 23andMe valued at $6B based primarily on pharmacogenomic data and analytics — same type of IP as TE's clinical platform

**2. Revenue wouldn't exist without the technology:**
- Without the pharmacogenomic platform, TE is a generic ibogaine clinic charging $10K-$15K per guest (not $26,600)
- The $12,000+ premium per guest is attributable to the precision medicine technology
- Post-care revenue ($5.1M at Y5) is 100% technology-delivered
- Bio-optimization premium ($1M at Y5) is 80% technology-driven

**3. Replicability proves the tech is the value:**
- The platform can be deployed to 20 locations globally with minimal modification
- Each new location pays the same technology fees
- The Mexican staff cannot be replicated without the platform; the platform can be replicated without the Mexican staff (in a different country with different staff)

## 10. Transfer Pricing: Justifying 30-40% for Technology {#10-transfer-pricing}

### 10.1 The Stacking Model (Revised for Dual Structure)

| Charge | Rate | Paid To | TP Method | Comparable |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Platform commission | 15% of revenue | UK Platform | CUP | Booking.com 15-25%, Airbnb 15-20% |
| Clinical IP royalty | 5% of revenue | NL Technology | CUP/Profit Split | Pharma royalties 4-8%, medtech 5-10% |
| Brand license | 3% of revenue | UK Platform | CUP | Hotel franchise 3-6% (Marriott, Hilton) |
| SaaS platform fee | $30-50K/mo | UK Platform | CUP | Enterprise health SaaS $20-60K/mo |
| Workforce mgmt SaaS | $15-25K/mo | UK Platform | CUP | Workday, ADP enterprise pricing |
| AI analytics fee | $10-20K/mo | NL Technology | CUP/Cost Plus | Health data analytics SaaS |
| Training & certification | $10-15K/mo | UK Platform | Cost Plus | Clinical training programs |
| Management fee | 2% of revenue | UK Platform | TNMM | Hotel management 3-5% |
| Intercompany interest | Market rate | UK HoldCo | CUP | Mexican market rates 8-12% |
| **Total extraction** | **~31-38%** | | | |

### 10.2 The Profit Split Method

For very integrated operations, the OECD recommends the **Transactional Profit Split Method (TPSM)**, which divides combined profit based on each party's contribution. This may be more defensible than stacking individual charges:

**Step 1: Combined profit**
Year 5 combined pre-tax profit: ~$21.5M (from $35.5M revenue minus $14M costs)

**Step 2: Allocate routine returns**
- Mexican OpCo: 10% return on $14M costs = $1.4M (routine return for limited-risk service provider)
- Remaining: $20.1M (residual profit)

**Step 3: Split residual based on value drivers**
- Technology (UK + NL): 70% of residual = $14.07M
- Mexican operations: 30% of residual = $6.03M

**Step 4: Total allocation**
- Mexico: $1.4M routine + $6.03M residual = $7.43M → tax at 30% = $2.23M
- Tech entities: $14.07M → blended tax at ~15% = $2.11M
- **Combined tax: $4.34M (20.2% effective)**

This produces similar results to the stacking model but may be more defensible because it's based on a single integrated methodology rather than multiple independent charges.

## 12. The Payroll Question: Can the Platform Pay Employees? {#12-the-payroll-question}

### 12.1 The Short Answer

**No — and yes, depending on what you mean by "pay."**

The platform **cannot be the employer** of Mexican workers. The platform **can process the payroll calculation and generate payment instructions** that the Mexican OpCo executes.

### 12.2 How Payroll-as-a-Service Works

│                                                                   │
│  4. OpCo Mexico:                                                  │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 12.3 The EOR Alternative (for Non-Core Staff)

For non-core functions (IT support, marketing, specialized consultants), the Mexican OpCo could use an Employer of Record (EOR) service like Deel, Remote, or Oyster. These companies:

- Have **owned Mexican legal entities** (not third-party partners)
- Are **REPSE-registered** for specialized services
- Employ workers on behalf of the client
- Handle all Mexican labor law compliance

However, for TE's core operations (clinical staff, hospitality staff), the Mexican OpCo must be the direct employer.

### 12.4 The Payroll SaaS Revenue

The payroll processing platform is a **licensable product** that generates SaaS revenue:

| Component | Monthly Fee | Annual Revenue |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Payroll engine (Mexican payroll calculations, CFDI generation) | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| Time & attendance (biometric/GPS clock, overtime tracking) | $5,000 | $60,000 |
| HR management (onboarding, documents, compliance tracking) | $4,000 | $48,000 |
| Benefits administration (IMSS, INFONAVIT, SAR management) | $3,000 | $36,000 |
| **Total Workforce Management SaaS** | **$20,000/mo** | **$240,000/yr** |

At scale (10+ locations): **$2.4M/year in workforce management SaaS revenue** — taxed at 25% (UK) or potentially 9% (NL Innovation Box if the payroll algorithms qualify).

## 13. Risk Assessment: Viability Analysis {#13-risk-assessment}

### 13.1 What's Viable (Green Light)

| Strategy | Viability | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| SaaS platform managing all operations | **High** | This is exactly what Cloudbeds, Mews, Oracle Hospitality do. Standard in the industry. |
| Clinical AI platform as separate IP | **High** | Pharmacogenomic dosing, brain mapping analysis, AI protocols are genuine, patentable IP. |
| Platform collecting guest payments | **High** | Booking.com model — well-established in hospitality. |
| Post-care subscriptions as 100% tech revenue | **Very High** | Digital delivery, no Mexican component. Cleanest revenue stream. |
| Workforce scheduling via app | **High** | Standard SaaS functionality. Not labor outsourcing. |
| Payroll calculation via platform | **High** | ADP/Gusto model. Platform calculates; employer pays. |
| IoT facility management | **High** | Predictive maintenance, energy optimization — standard tech. |
| Dual UK + NL jurisdiction | **High** | Common European tech structure. Both OECD members. |

### 13.2 What's Risky (Yellow Light)

| Strategy | Viability | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Platform commission of 15%+ | **Medium** | Defensible by Booking.com comparables, but SAT may argue the TE case is different (vertically integrated, not a marketplace) |
| Aggregate extraction of 30%+ | **Medium** | Each charge is arm's length individually, but SAT may challenge the combined impact |
| Villa tokenization | **Medium** | Legal innovation but untested in Mexico. SAT may recharacterize as Mexican-source real estate income |
| UK Patent Box for SaaS platform income | **Medium** | May not qualify (platform fees aren't "patented inventions"). Hence the dual structure recommendation. |
| REFIPRE treatment of IP Box income | **Medium** | Open question — needs counsel resolution before implementation |

### 13.3 What's Not Viable (Red Light)

| Strategy | Viability | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| UK entity employing Mexican workers | **Not viable** | Creates PE in Mexico; violates outsourcing reform if providing workers for core activities |
| Mexican OpCo at zero profit | **Not viable** | Fails arm's length test. No comparable healthcare facility earns 0% on complex operations |
| Platform "directing" Mexican workers | **Not viable** | Must be Mexican managers who direct workers; platform provides "guidance" and "tools" |
| Claiming 70%+ of revenue for tech | **Aggressive** | Defensible in theory but will be challenged. Better to target 30-40% extraction with robust documentation. |
| Crypto payments to avoid Mexican tax | **Not viable** | Crypto changes the payment method, not the tax obligation. Mexican-source income is taxable regardless of how payment is made. |
| "Hiding" revenue from SAT | **Not viable** | Tax evasion is criminal. Every strategy must be disclosed and documented. |

### 14.2 Five-Year Summary

| Metric | Total Tech Envelope | All-in-Mexico Baseline | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Total revenue (HC + Villas + Post-Care + Bio-Opt) | $234,656,500 | $234,656,500 | — |
| Total estimated tax | ~$14,041,000 | ~$36,500,000 | — |
| **Tax savings** | | | **~$22,459,000** |
| Annual substance cost (UK + NL) | ~$6,000,000 cumulative | $0 | -$6,000,000 |

## 16. Open Questions for Counsel {#16-open-questions}

### Critical (Must Resolve Before Implementation)

1. **REFIPRE determination:** Does Mexico evaluate REFIPRE on the jurisdiction's headline rate or the effective rate on the specific income stream? If the UK Patent Box (10%) or Dutch Innovation Box (9%) triggers REFIPRE, the entire IP structuring strategy needs modification.

2. **Outsourcing reform compliance:** Does a UK SaaS platform that generates work schedules, calculates payroll, and dispatches tasks to Mexican workers via an app constitute "subcontracting" under the 2021 reform? Or is it clearly a technology service?

3. **PE risk:** Does the TE Platform Ltd (UK) collecting all guest payments and contracting with Mexican OpCo for service delivery create a permanent establishment in Mexico under the UK-Mexico treaty?

4. **Platform commission characterization:** Will SAT treat a 15% platform commission as a legitimate service fee (deductible) or attempt to recharacterize it as something else?

5. **Innovation Box eligibility (NL):** Does TE's pharmacogenomic dosing platform and AI clinical protocol engine qualify for the Dutch Innovation Box? What specific IP registrations (patents, copyright) are needed?

### Important (Resolve During Implementation)

6. **Advance Pricing Agreement:** Is a bilateral APA (Mexico-UK or Mexico-NL) available and advisable? This would pre-agree the transfer pricing methodology and eliminate audit risk.

7. **Villa tokenization jurisdiction:** Where should security tokens be issued — UK (FCA regulated) or a more crypto-friendly jurisdiction? How does this interact with Mexican real estate tax obligations?

8. **Post-care revenue source:** Will SAT attempt to characterize post-care subscription revenue from former Mexican guests as Mexican-source income, even though the service is delivered digitally from the UK/NL?

9. **Intercompany loan structure:** What is the maximum loan-to-equity ratio for the Mexico OpCo before thin-cap rules bite? Is 3:1 still the safe harbor?

10. **Data processing location:** If clinical data is processed by the NL Technology entity using EU-hosted servers, does any of this income have a Mexican source under LISR Article 167-179?

### Strategic

11. **Optimal timing:** Should the dual-jurisdiction structure be implemented immediately at seed stage, or should we start with a single UK entity and add the NL entity when revenue justifies the complexity?

12. **Patent filing strategy:** What should be patented first? The pharmacogenomic dosing algorithm is the strongest candidate. Brain mapping analysis. AI treatment protocol generation. Prioritize based on Patent Box / Innovation Box qualification requirements.

13. **Compliance cost at scale:** What is the all-in annual cost of maintaining this structure (UK + NL + Mexico + TP + legal + audit) at various revenue levels? At what revenue does it become clearly justified?

---

## 17. Global Expansion: The Consolidated Netherlands Model {#17-global-expansion}

Sections 6-8 of this document recommended a dual UK + NL structure, with the UK entity at 25% handling the operational platform and the NL entity at 9% housing clinical IP. That recommendation was **optimized for Mexico's REFIPRE rules**. When viewed through a global lens — 10-20 TE locations across multiple continents — the calculus shifts significantly.

### 17.1 The Problem with the Dual Structure at Scale

The dual UK + NL model places **53% of extracted revenue ($10.9M at Y5) at the UK's 25% standard rate** because that income (platform commissions, brand license, management fees, SaaS ops) doesn't qualify for any IP box. The 9% Innovation Box rate only applies to the $7.5M in genuine clinical IP income.

This means the UK entity is essentially a 25% tax entity — the same rate as paying standard corporate tax in most OECD countries. The dual structure adds compliance cost and complexity for a blended rate of ~19.7%. For a single Mexico location, this is justified by REFIPRE safety. For a global portfolio, it's overengineered.

### 17.2 The REFIPRE Constraint Is Mexico-Specific

REFIPRE (Regimenes Fiscales Preferentes) is a Mexican anti-avoidance rule. Most countries TE would expand to do not have an equivalent:

| Future TE Location | Corporate Tax | REFIPRE-Type Rule? | Impact on Structure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Costa Rica** | 30% | No — territorial tax system; only taxes local income | NL Innovation Box income not at risk |
| **Jamaica** | 25% | Limited — transfer pricing rules only | NL Innovation Box works |
| **Portugal** | 21% | EU ATAD — anti-avoidance, but NL Innovation Box is EU-compliant | No issue within EU |
| **Thailand** | 20% | Transfer pricing rules; no REFIPRE equivalent | NL Innovation Box works |
| **Colombia** | 35% | Yes — similar to Mexico's REFIPRE | Same analysis as Mexico required |
| **Brazil** | 34% | Yes — stringent transfer pricing (fixed margins) | Requires specific Brazil analysis |
| **UAE** | 0-9% | No | NL Innovation Box works |
| **Spain** | 25% | EU ATAD — but NL is EU, so no withholding issues | No issue within EU |
| **Greece** | 22% | EU ATAD | No issue within EU |
| **Italy** | 24% | EU ATAD | No issue within EU |
| **Canada** (HQ market) | 26.5% | FAPI rules — CFC-style, but applies to ownership, not payments | Relevant for Canadian founder |
| **US** (investor market) | 21% + state | GILTI / BEAT — anti-avoidance for US shareholders | Relevant for US investors |

**Key takeaway:** Only Mexico and Colombia have REFIPRE-style rules among likely TE locations. For the other 8-15 locations, a lower-rate entity works without constraint.

### 17.3 The Netherlands Solves Both Problems

The Netherlands has a **25.8% headline rate** — above Mexico's 22.5% REFIPRE threshold. This gives it the same REFIPRE defense as the UK. But unlike the UK, the Netherlands also offers:

| Factor | UK | Netherlands | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| IP box rate | 10% (Patent Box) | 9% (Innovation Box) | **NL** |
| Qualifying IP scope | Patents required (narrow) | Copyrighted software + WBSO R&D (broader) | **NL** (significantly) |
| Headline rate | 25% | 25.8% | UK (slightly, but both REFIPRE safe) |
| REFIPRE safe for Mexico | Yes (25% > 22.5%) | Yes (25.8% > 22.5%) | **Tie** |
| Mexico treaty WHT on royalties | 10% | 10% | **Tie** |
| EU membership | No (post-Brexit) | Yes | **NL** (EU expansion + directives) |
| EU Interest & Royalties Directive | Not applicable | 0% WHT on royalties to/from EU entities | **NL** |
| EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive | Not applicable | 0% WHT on dividends within EU | **NL** |
| Software qualification | Must be patented to qualify | Copyright sufficient for smaller taxpayers | **NL** |
| Tech talent pool | Excellent (London) | Very good (Amsterdam, Eindhoven) | UK (slightly) |
| Dividend WHT outbound | 0% (most cases) | 0% within EU; 0-15% otherwise | Depends on destination |
| Substance costs | $500K-$1.5M/yr | $400K-$1.2M/yr | **NL** |

**For a global multi-location business, the Netherlands is the stronger single-jurisdiction choice.** The decisive advantages:

1. **Innovation Box qualifies copyrighted software** — TE's platform is primarily software, not patented hardware. UK Patent Box requires patents; Dutch Innovation Box accepts copyright. This means MORE revenue qualifies for the reduced rate.

2. **EU membership** — For European expansion (Portugal, Spain, Greece, Italy), the EU Interest & Royalties Directive eliminates withholding tax on royalties between EU entities. The Parent-Subsidiary Directive eliminates withholding tax on dividends. Post-Brexit UK has neither.

3. **Same Mexico REFIPRE defense** — Netherlands' 25.8% headline rate provides the identical REFIPRE argument as UK's 25%.

### 17.4 The Consolidated NL Model: Revenue Split

In a single-NL-entity model, the split is no longer "UK vs. NL" — it becomes "income qualifying for Innovation Box (9%) vs. income at standard rate (25.8%)":

**Qualifies for Innovation Box (9%):**
- Clinical IP royalties (pharmacogenomic dosing, treatment protocols) — core qualifying IP
- AI/ML model licensing (brain mapping, outcome prediction) — qualifying software
- Post-care subscriptions (AI coaching, digital health protocols) — delivered via qualifying software
- Bio-optimization digital protocols — delivered via qualifying software
- Workforce management algorithms (scheduling optimization, task dispatch) — if WBSO-certified
- IoT predictive maintenance algorithms — if WBSO-certified
- Personalized nutrition planning algorithms — if WBSO-certified
- Booking engine matching algorithms — if patented or WBSO-certified

**Does NOT qualify for Innovation Box (25.8%):**
- Brand / trademark licensing — trademarks never qualify in any IP box regime globally
- Management fees — service income, not IP
- Intercompany interest — financial income
- Pure marketplace commission (if the matching algorithm isn't patented) — commercial income

### 17.5 How Much Qualifies? The Blended Rate

The critical variable is what percentage of the technology entity's revenue qualifies for the Innovation Box. This depends on how aggressively TE patents and registers its software IP:

| Scenario | % Qualifying for Innovation Box | Blended NL Rate | Y5 Tax on $18.4M Revenue | vs. Dual UK+NL ($4.07M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Conservative** — Only clinical AI qualifies | 40% | 19.1% | $3.51M | Saves $560K/yr |
| **Moderate** — Clinical + post-care + AI ops | 60% | 15.7% | $2.89M | Saves $1.18M/yr |
| **Aggressive** — Everything except brand + mgmt | 75% | 13.6% | $2.50M | Saves $1.57M/yr |
| **Maximum** — Patent/register everything possible | 85% | 12.3% | $2.26M | Saves $1.81M/yr |

**The moderate scenario (60% qualifying) is realistic with proper WBSO certification and patent filings.** This yields a 15.7% blended rate on tech revenue — meaningfully better than the dual structure's 19.7%.

### 17.6 What Makes Revenue "Qualify" for Innovation Box

To maximize the qualifying percentage, TE needs to:

**Step 1: Obtain WBSO Certificate (Wet Bevordering Speur- en Ontwikkelingswerk)**
- WBSO is the Dutch R&D tax certificate issued by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO)
- Required for Innovation Box eligibility for companies without patents
- Application describes the R&D projects being performed
- Must be applied for before starting the R&D work (or within the fiscal year)
- Covers: development of technically new software, algorithms, processes, products

**Step 2: Register copyrighted software**
- For companies with less than EUR 37.5M group revenue (TE qualifies initially), a WBSO declaration alone is sufficient — no patent required
- Above EUR 37.5M, a patent or exclusive license is needed
- This threshold is based on the 5-year average group revenue

**Step 3: Patent strategically**
- Patent the highest-value algorithms: pharmacogenomic dosing, brain mapping analysis, scheduling optimization
- Each patent strengthens the Innovation Box position and extends eligibility above the EUR 37.5M threshold
- European Patent Office (EPO) filings protect across all EU markets simultaneously

**Step 4: Apply the BEPS Nexus Fraction**
- The Innovation Box benefit is proportional to qualifying R&D performed by the NL entity
- Formula: (Own R&D expenditure + 30% uplift for outsourced R&D) / Total R&D expenditure
- To maximize: perform core R&D in the Netherlands or through NL-contracted teams
- Outsourced R&D to related parties (e.g., contractors in Mexico) counts toward the denominator but NOT the numerator (reducing the fraction)
- **Practical impact:** Hire the core AI/ML and clinical engineering team in the Netherlands

### 17.8 Why UK HoldCo Is Still Needed (Just Not for Operations)

The UK entity remains in the structure but with a reduced role — **dividend conduit** only:

| Function | Old Role (Dual Structure) | New Role (Consolidated NL) |
|---|---|---|
| Guest payments | Collected by UK Platform | Collected by NL entity |
| Brand licensing | UK Platform charged brand fees | NL entity owns brand |
| Management fees | UK Platform charged mgmt fees | NL entity charges mgmt fees |
| IP licensing | Split between UK and NL | All in NL |
| Dividend flow | UK → Panama PIF | NL → UK → Panama PIF |
| Strategic governance | UK board made decisions | UK board oversees; NL management operates |

**Why not go NL → Panama PIF directly?**

The Netherlands imposes a **15% dividend withholding tax** on distributions to non-EU/non-treaty shareholders. Panama has no tax treaty with the Netherlands. Routing through UK HoldCo solves this:

1. NL → UK: **0% WHT** (EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive — still applies to UK under the UK-NL treaty)
2. UK → Panama PIF: **0% WHT** (UK has no outbound dividend WHT)
3. Panama PIF: **0% tax** on foreign income

Without the UK HoldCo, the NL → Panama route would lose **15% on every dividend** — far more expensive than maintaining a minimal UK shell.

### 17.9 Financial Comparison: Dual vs. Consolidated (Y5)

| Metric | Dual UK+NL (Section 8) | Consolidated NL (60% IB) | Consolidated NL (75% IB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UK Platform income** | $10.93M @ 25% = $2.73M | — | — |
| **NL Innovation Box income** | $7.51M @ 9% = $0.68M | $11.04M @ 9% = $0.99M | $13.80M @ 9% = $1.24M |
| **NL Standard rate income** | — | $7.36M @ 25.8% = $1.90M | $4.60M @ 25.8% = $1.19M |
| **Mexico OpCo + PropCo** | $2.22M @ 30% = $0.66M | $2.22M @ 30% = $0.66M | $2.22M @ 30% = $0.66M |
| **Total tax** | **$4.07M** | **$3.55M** | **$3.09M** |
| **Blended effective rate** | **19.7%** | **17.2%** | **15.0%** |
| **Savings vs. dual** | — | **$520K/yr** | **$980K/yr** |
| **Savings vs. all-Mexico** | $2.13M/yr | $2.65M/yr | $3.11M/yr |
| **Substance cost** | ~$1.4M/yr (UK + NL) | ~$1.0M/yr (NL only) | ~$1.0M/yr (NL only) |
| **Net savings vs. all-Mexico** | $730K/yr | **$1.65M/yr** | **$2.11M/yr** |

### 17.10 At Global Scale: 10 Locations

The consolidated NL model becomes dramatically more powerful at scale because the technology entity serves multiple OpCos with zero marginal tax cost per additional location:

| Scale | Total Revenue (all locations) | NL Tech Entity Revenue (30% extraction) | NL Tax (60% IB) | All Local OpCo Tax | Total Tax | Effective Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 location (Y5) | $35.5M | $10.7M | $1.79M | $0.66M | $2.45M | ~12.1% on tech income |
| 3 locations | $90M | $27M | $4.52M | $2.0M | $6.52M | ~12.1% on tech income |
| 5 locations | $150M | $45M | $7.53M | $3.3M | $10.83M | ~12.1% on tech income |
| 10 locations | $300M | $90M | $15.06M | $6.6M | $21.66M | ~12.1% on tech income |
| 10 locations (all-local model) | $300M | — | — | $45M+ | $45M+ | ~30% |

**At 10 locations, the NL consolidated model saves approximately $23M/year vs. keeping all revenue in local jurisdictions.**

The per-location substance cost for the NL entity stays roughly flat — one engineering team serves all 10 locations. The marginal cost of adding a location to the platform is near zero on the technology side. Only the local OpCo adds headcount.

### 17.11 Treaty Coverage: NL vs. UK for Global Expansion

| TE Target Country | NL Treaty? | NL Royalty WHT | UK Treaty? | UK Royalty WHT | Better For TE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mexico | Yes | 10% | Yes | 10% | **Tie** |
| Costa Rica | Yes | 10% | Yes | 10% | **Tie** |
| Jamaica | Yes | 10% | Yes | 10% | **Tie** |
| Portugal | Yes (EU) | **0%** (I&R Directive) | Yes | 5% | **NL** |
| Spain | Yes (EU) | **0%** (I&R Directive) | Yes | 5-10% | **NL** |
| Greece | Yes (EU) | **0%** (I&R Directive) | Yes | 5-7% | **NL** |
| Italy | Yes (EU) | **0%** (I&R Directive) | Yes | 8% | **NL** |
| Thailand | Yes | 5-15% | Yes | 5-15% | **Tie** |
| Colombia | Yes | 10% | Yes | 10% | **Tie** |
| Brazil | Yes | 15% | Yes (limited) | 15% | **NL** (stronger treaty) |
| UAE | Yes | 0% | Yes | 0% | **Tie** |
| Canada | Yes | 10% | Yes | 10% | **Tie** |
| US | Yes | 0% (if structured properly) | Yes | 0% | **Tie** |

**The Netherlands wins decisively for European expansion** because the EU Interest & Royalties Directive eliminates withholding tax on royalties between EU member states. Post-Brexit UK loses this advantage. For a TE in Portugal, Spain, or Greece, royalties flowing to a UK entity face 5-10% WHT, while royalties to a Dutch entity face **0%**.

### 17.12 Key Risks of the Consolidated NL Model

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Mexico challenges NL's 25.8% headline rate as REFIPRE-safe while Innovation Box effective rate is 9% | Medium (same as UK Patent Box risk) | NL Innovation Box passed OECD BEPS Action 5 review; headline rate is the standard measure |
| Innovation Box benefit reduced if nexus fraction is low (too much outsourced R&D) | Medium | Hire core R&D team in NL; keep outsourced-to-related-party R&D below 30% |
| NL substance costs higher than expected | Low | Amsterdam tech salaries are competitive with London; office costs lower |
| EU Pillar Two (global minimum tax 15%) applies | Medium (if group revenue > EUR 750M) | Not relevant until TE reaches ~$800M+ revenue; decades away |
| NL changes Innovation Box rate | Low (stable since 2010, recently reduced from 10% to 9%) | Political stability; NL committed to innovation incentives |
| Dividend WHT on NL → Panama (if UK HoldCo is disregarded) | Low (if UK HoldCo has substance) | Maintain UK board meetings, bank account, governance |

### 17.13 Updated Recommendation for Global Expansion

**For a global TE network, the consolidated Netherlands model is superior to the dual UK + NL structure:**

1. **TE Global Technology B.V. (Netherlands)** — single entity housing all IP, platform, clinical AI, data, brand, guest relationships. Innovation Box at 9% on qualifying income (target 60-75%), standard 25.8% on the rest. Blended rate: **13-16%**.

2. **UK HoldCo Ltd** — minimal substance holding company. Sole purpose: receive dividends from NL at 0% WHT (EU directive) and pass to Panama PIF at 0% WHT (UK law). Annual cost: ~$50K-$100K.

3. **Panama PIF** — ultimate personal ownership. 0% tax on foreign income. No CFC rules. Asset protection.

4. **Local OpCos** — one per TE location. Cost-plus service provider. Employs all local staff. Earns 8-12% margin on costs. Taxed at local rate on minimal profit.

5. **Patent aggressively in the Netherlands** — file EPO patents on pharmacogenomic dosing engine, AI treatment protocol generator, scheduling optimization algorithms, brain mapping analysis system. Each patent increases Innovation Box qualifying income and extends eligibility above the EUR 37.5M threshold.

6. **Get WBSO certification immediately** upon NL incorporation — this is the gateway to Innovation Box. Apply before any R&D work begins.

## Appendix A: Comparison of All Five Strategy Documents

| Document | Core Model | Effective Tax Rate | Risk Level | REFIPRE Status | Best For |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **1. Corporate Structure** | Traditional holding company | 25-32% | Low | Safe | Conservative investors |
| **2. Global Tax Optimization** | Panama PIF + Treaty routing | 15-20% (corp), 0% (personal) | Medium | Depends on routing | Maximum personal tax elimination |
| **3. Technology IP Offshore** | UK Patent Box licensing | 10% on IP income | Medium | **Uncertain** | Tech licensing to multiple locations |
| **4. Platform-as-Principal** | App-centric; Mexico as contractor | 13-18% blended | Medium-High | **Uncertain** | Maximum revenue extraction from Mexico |
| **5. Total Tech Envelope** (this doc) | Consolidated NL; techify everything | **13-16% blended** | **Medium** | **Safe** (NL 25.8% headline) | Global expansion + meaningful savings |

### Updated Recommended Synthesis (Post-Global Analysis)

Section 17 of this document reanalyzed the structure through a global lens. The updated recommendation:

1. **Panama PIF** for ultimate personal ownership (Doc 2)
2. **UK HoldCo Ltd (minimal)** — dividend conduit only. Receives dividends from NL at 0% WHT (EU directive), passes to Panama PIF at 0% WHT (UK law). Annual cost ~$50K-$100K.
3. **TE Global Technology B.V. (Netherlands)** — single entity housing ALL technology, platform, clinical AI, data, brand, and guest relationships. Innovation Box at 9% on qualifying IP (target 60-75% of revenue), standard 25.8% on the rest. Blended rate: **13-16%** depending on patent/WBSO coverage.
4. **Local OpCos in each country** — cost-plus service providers (8-12% margin on costs). Employ all local staff. Pay local tax on minimal profit.
5. **Villa tokenization** through NL entity or dedicated marketplace subsidiary (Doc 4)
6. **Robust transfer pricing documentation** with Big 4 firm (all docs)

**Why consolidated NL beats dual UK + NL:**
- Simpler (one tech entity, not two)
- Cheaper (~$400K/yr less substance cost)
- Lower blended rate (13-16% vs. 19.7%) because more income qualifies under Innovation Box's broader scope
- Better for EU expansion (0% WHT on royalties via I&R Directive)
- Same REFIPRE defense (25.8% headline > 22.5% threshold)

**Estimated blended effective tax rate: 13-16% (single location) → 12-14% (at scale)**
**vs. all-in-local: 25-30%**
**5-year net benefit (single location): ~$13-15 million**
**Annual savings at 10 locations: ~$23 million vs. all-local model**
