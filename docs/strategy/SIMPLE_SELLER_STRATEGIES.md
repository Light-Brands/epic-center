# How We Work With the Seller

**3 ways to buy the property where the seller stays involved. Each one makes him more money than a clean cash sale.**

---

## Option A: "The Legacy Deal"

**Seller Carries Most of the Note + Keeps 10% Equity**

We pay $3M cash upfront. Seller finances $7.5M. He keeps 10% of the real estate (non-voting). He stays connected to the property — his name on a plaque, quarterly updates, equity that grows.

```
SELLER gets:
  $3M cash -----> Day 1
  $7.5M note ---> 7.5% interest, paid quarterly, balloon at Year 5
  10% equity ---> Worth $2.5-4M at Year 5
                  ---------
                  TOTAL: $14.4-15.9M on a $10.5M sale
```

**What the seller gets:**
- $3M in his pocket on closing day
- $7.5M loan at 7.5% (better than a savings account, secured by his own property)
- 10% ownership that grows as the property value grows
- Total return: 37-52% more than the sale price

**What we get:**
- Only need $3M cash at close (instead of $10M+)
- 7.5% interest rate (market rate for private lending is 10-12%)
- Full voting control — his 10% is silent
- 2 years interest-only before we start paying principal

**The pitch to the seller:**
> "You're not losing your property. You're becoming its legacy steward. Your name stays on the wall. Your wealth keeps growing. And you get paid every quarter."

**Who this works for:** A seller who loves his property and wants to stay connected. Emotional seller. Someone who'd rather earn more over time than take a lump sum.

## Option B: "The Bank Deal"

**Seller Becomes the Lender + Gets Profit Sharing**

Seller carries the biggest possible note ($8M). No equity at all. Instead, he gets 4% of our annual profits for 10 years (capped at $5M total). He's the bank. His return scales with our success.

```
SELLER gets:
  $2-2.5M cash --> Day 1
  $8M note ------> 8% interest, paid quarterly, balloon at Year 5
  4% of EBITDA --> For 10 years, capped at $5M total
                   ---------
                   TOTAL: $16.9-17.4M on a $10M sale
```

**What the seller gets:**
- $2-2.5M cash at close
- $8M at 8% interest (contractual, predictable)
- Profit sharing that could reach $5M over 10 years
- Total return: 69-74% more than the sale price
- Highest cash return of all three options

**What we get:**
- Only $2-2.5M cash needed at close
- 100% equity in the real estate from Day 1 (no seller ownership)
- Profit sharing is capped — we know the maximum cost
- We can buy out the profit share early at present value
- Zero governance rights for the seller

**The pitch to the seller:**
> "You built the foundation. We're building the future on top of it. As the future grows, so does your return. And it's all cash — no complicated equity."

**Who this works for:** A seller who wants maximum cash. Doesn't care about staying involved. Wants the biggest number. Thinks in dollars, not feelings.

## Option C: "The Partner Deal"

**Seller Reinvests + Gets Equity in Everything**

Seller carries $6M note at the lowest rate (7%). He reinvests $2M back into renovations. He gets equity in both the property (8%) AND the operating business (2.5%). Plus a paid advisory board seat ($50K/year). He's all in.

```
SELLER gets:
  $2M cash ------> Day 1
  $6M note -------> 7% interest (lowest rate — he's aligned)
  $2M reinvested -> Goes into renovations (grows his own equity)
  8% RE equity ---> Worth $2-3.2M at Year 5
  2.5% OpCo -----> Worth $3.7M at Year 5 (on a $147M business)
  Advisory fee ---> $50K/year + annual retreat stay
                    ---------
                    TOTAL: $16-20M+ on a $10M sale
```

**What the seller gets:**
- Highest potential total return of all options ($16-20M+)
- Equity in a $147M enterprise (his 2.5% OpCo alone could be worth $3.7M)
- Paid advisory role — real purpose, real money
- His $2M reinvestment directly increases his own equity value
- Lowest note amount = gets paid back fastest

**What we get:**
- Smallest debt ($6M vs $7.5-8M in other options)
- Lowest interest rate (7%)
- $2M toward renovations from the seller (less we need to raise)
- A seller who's now our biggest advocate (he's literally invested)
- Strongest signal to outside investors ("the seller put money BACK in")

**The pitch to the seller:**
> "You're not selling your property. You're joining a mission. Your name is on the wall. Your wealth grows with every life we change. You're not a former owner — you're a founding steward."

**Who this works for:** A seller going through a life transition (divorce, retirement). Someone who wants purpose and connection. Someone who trusts the vision and wants upside.

## Side by Side

| | Option A: Legacy | Option B: Bank | Option C: Partner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vibe** | Stay connected | Get paid the most | Go all in |
| **Cash at close** | $3M | $2-2.5M | $2M |
| **Seller note** | $7.5M at 7.5% | $8M at 8% | $6M at 7% |
| **Seller equity** | 10% RE | None | 8% RE + 2.5% OpCo |
| **Total return** | $14.4-15.9M | $16.9-17.4M | $16-20M+ |
| **Seller involvement** | Low (updates only) | None (cash only) | High (advisory board) |
| **Best for seller who...** | Loves the property | Wants max cash | Wants to be part of it |
| **Best for us because...** | Low cash, easy sell | 100% ownership, clean | Lowest debt, built-in advocate |

**Bottom line:** Every option pays the seller more than a clean cash sale. We're not asking him to take less — we're showing him how to get more. The question is just how involved he wants to be.
