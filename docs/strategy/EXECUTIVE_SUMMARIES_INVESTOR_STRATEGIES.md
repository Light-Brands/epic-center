## Strategy 1: Preferred Equity with Mandatory Redemption

### What It Is

Investors provide 100% of the capital across two vehicles — real estate and operating company — in exchange for preferred equity positions with defined returns and a fixed exit timeline. No investor receives permanent common equity in the real estate entity. Founders contribute vision, IP, execution, and management — not cash.

**Best for:** Family offices, yield-oriented high-net-worth investors, real estate allocators seeking bond-like returns with hard asset security.

---

### Capital Structure

| Vehicle | Instrument | Amount | Key Terms |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Real Estate | Non-voting preferred equity | $10–12M | 9% cumulative preferred; mandatory redemption Year 5 |
| Operating Company | Class B preferred shares | $2–2.5M | 20–25% equity; 10% cumulative preferred |
| Operating Company | Revenue participation | $2.5–3M | 5% of gross revenue until 2.0x returned; no equity |
| **Total** | | **$15–17M** | |

---

### Ownership & Control

| | At Close | At Year 5 |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **RE common equity** | 100% Founders | 100% Founders |
| **RE voting control** | 100% Founders | 100% Founders |
| **OpCo equity** | 75% Founders / 25% Investors | 75% Founders / 25% Investors |
| **RE preferred equity** | 100% Investors | 0% (redeemed) |

Founders hold full management authority over both vehicles. Investor protective provisions are limited to entity sale, major debt, related-party transactions, and governing document changes.

---

### Investor Returns

- **RE investors:** 9% cumulative preferred return, paid quarterly from Year 2. Mandatory capital redemption at Year 5. Estimated total return: ~$12.7M on $10M invested (~27% total return).
- **OpCo equity investors:** 10% cumulative preferred, 1x liquidation preference, pro-rata rights, board observer seat.
- **Revenue participation investors:** 5% of gross revenue paid quarterly from Month 6. Self-liquidates when 2.0x capital is returned (~Year 5). No equity dilution.

---

### Risk & Downside Protection

- **First-position lien** on $10–12M Tulum property via fideicomiso
- **Forced sale right** if mandatory redemption is not met at Year 5
- **Step-in management** triggered if DSCR falls below 1.2x
- **Revenue participation is off the top** — paid before operating expenses
- **83% gross margins** and ~3% break-even occupancy (25 guests/year) provide massive operating buffer
- **Annual independent appraisal** for ongoing LTV monitoring

---

### Why This Strategy Works

**For investors:** Bond-like economics secured by hard real estate. A defined exit at Year 5 — not a permanent illiquid position. Forced sale backstop if anything goes wrong. Simple and predictable.

**For founders:** Zero permanent dilution on real estate. At Year 5, preferred equity is redeemed and revenue participation self-extinguishes — founders own the property outright and control a ~$189M enterprise with ~75% ownership. IP remains permanently protected in the Cayman holding company, outside all investor vehicles.

---
---

## Strategy 2: Secured Debt with Revenue Participation

### What It Is

All real estate capital is raised as secured debt (private promissory notes) rather than equity. Founders own 100% of the real estate from day one. Operating company capital is raised through minority equity plus a self-liquidating revenue share. Debt service is the explicit, bounded trade-off for maximum ownership.

**Best for:** Credit-oriented family offices, private lenders, fixed-income investors seeking 11% secured yields backed by coastal Mexican real estate.

---

### Capital Structure

| Vehicle | Instrument | Amount | Key Terms |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Real Estate | Senior secured notes | $10–12M | 11% fixed interest; interest-only 24 months; amortizing months 25–60; balloon at Year 5 |
| Operating Company | Class B preferred shares | $2.5–3M | 30% equity; 10% cumulative preferred |
| Operating Company | Revenue participation | $2–2.5M | 6% of gross revenue until 2.0x returned; no equity |
| **Total** | | **$15–17M** | |

---

### Ownership & Control

| | At Close | At Year 5 (Debt Retired) |
|---|----------|--------------------------|
| **RE equity** | 100% Founders | 100% Founders |
| **RE control** | 100% Founders | 100% Founders |
| **OpCo equity** | 70% Founders / 30% Investors | 70% Founders / 30% Investors |
| **RE debt** | $10–12M outstanding | $0 (retired) |

Debt holders are creditors, not owners. They have no LP governance, no board seats, and no management authority. This is the maximum-ownership strategy.

---

### Investor Returns

- **RE debt investors:** 11% annual fixed interest, contractual and predictable. Not dependent on occupancy, revenue, or exit. Total payments over 5 years: ~$14.5M on $11M invested. Secured by first-lien on property.
- **OpCo equity investors:** 10% cumulative preferred, 1x liquidation preference, 30% equity in a business projecting 78% IRR and 6.8x MOIC.
- **Revenue participation investors:** 6% of gross revenue quarterly from Month 6. 2.0x cap reached during Year 4. Self-liquidates. No equity.

---

### Risk & Downside Protection

- **First-position lien** on property — debt holders are senior to all equity in any liquidation
- **Cross-default provision** — RE default triggers step-in rights on intercompany fee flows
- **Forced sale right** on default after 90-day cure period
- **Fixed contractual return** — 11% interest is owed regardless of business performance
- **Annual independent appraisal** for LTV monitoring
- **Refinancing reduces risk over time** — as the property appreciates and the business matures, conventional bank refinancing at 5–7% replaces private notes

---

### Why This Strategy Works

**For investors:** The oldest and simplest investment instrument — a secured loan against real property at an attractive yield. 11% annual return, senior claim, hard asset collateral. No operating risk exposure. Short 5-year duration with amortization reducing principal over time.

**For founders:** Maximum ownership from day one — 100% of RE, 70% of OpCo. Debt is finite; equity is forever. Once notes are retired at Year 5, founders own the property outright with no investor claims. Refinancing optionality lets founders replace 11% private notes with 5–7% conventional bank debt as the business matures.

---
---

## Strategy 3: Real Estate Fund with Convertible Operating Capital

### What It Is

Real estate is acquired through an institutional limited partnership fund structure. Operating capital is raised via convertible notes that auto-convert to equity at Month 24 (or can be bought back at 1.5x). Founders serve as General Partner with full management control. This gives founders 24 months to prove the model before permanent OpCo dilution is locked in.

**Best for:** Institutional PE firms, sophisticated angels, venture-oriented family offices comfortable with fund structures and milestone-based conversion mechanics.

---

### Capital Structure

| Vehicle | Instrument | Amount | Key Terms |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Real Estate | LP fund units | $10–12M | 8% preferred return; 80/20 split above hurdle; optional LP redemption Year 5 |
| Operating Company | Convertible notes | $3–4M | 8% accruing interest; auto-convert Month 24 at $15M cap; or 1.5x repayment |
| Operating Company | Direct equity | $1–1.5M | 15–20% preferred; 12% cumulative; 1x liquidation preference |
| **Total** | | **$15–17M** | |

**GP commitment (1–2%)** can be funded from management fee offsets — zero cash from founders.

---

### Ownership & Control

| | At Close | Post-Conversion (Month 24) | After Full LP Redemption |
|---|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **RE Fund — GP** | 100% management control; 1–2% economic | Same | 100% economic + control |
| **RE Fund — LP** | 98–99% economic; no management control | Same | 0% (redeemed) |
| **OpCo (pre-convert)** | 80–100% Founders | — | — |
| **OpCo (post-convert)** | — | ≥70% Founders / up to 30% Investors | Same |

The GP controls all property decisions, capital calls, distributions, and operations. LPs have no management authority.

---

### Investor Returns

- **RE LP investors:** 8% preferred return (hurdle); 80/20 profit split above hurdle; 20% carried interest to GP. Estimated LP MOIC: ~1.4x. LP IRR: ~12–15%. Optional redemption at Year 5 NAV via independent appraisal.
- **Convertible note investors:** 8% accruing interest. Auto-convert at Month 24 into up to 25% OpCo equity at a $15M valuation cap. If enterprise value at conversion exceeds $15M, investors enter at a discount. Buy-back floor of 1.5x guarantees minimum 50% return.
- **Direct equity investors:** 12% cumulative preferred, 1x liquidation preference, 15–20% equity with anti-dilution and pro-rata rights.

---

### Risk & Downside Protection

- **LP interests represent beneficial ownership** of $10–12M real property in Tulum's restricted coastal zone
- **8% preferred hurdle** before GP participates in any profits
- **Annual independent appraisal** and quarterly NAV updates ensure transparent valuation
- **Forced liquidation right** — LP majority can force fund liquidation after Year 5 if NAV redemption unfunded within 12 months
- **Convertible note floor** — even if the business underperforms, 8% accruing interest provides a return floor; 1.5x maturity backstop at Month 60
- **Institutional governance** — fund structure with independent auditor, quarterly reporting, annual audit

---

### Why This Strategy Works

**For investors:** Institutional-grade structure immediately familiar to PE firms and family offices. A recognized real estate fund format with a proven waterfall. Convertible notes offer downside protection (8% interest + 1.5x backstop) with upside participation (equity at a capped valuation in a 78% IRR business). Multiple exit paths: NAV redemption, fund liquidation, secondary sale.

**For founders:** GP economics are powerful — 1.5% management fee provides income from day one (~$165K/year on $11M), plus 20% carried interest on profits above the hurdle. Pre-conversion, founders own 100% of OpCo for 24 months — enough time to prove the model. Buy-back option at 1.5x lets founders prevent conversion entirely if the business performs well. IP remains permanently protected in the Cayman entity, outside the fund.
