## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents three distinct, optimized investment strategies designed for a specific and unusual transaction: the acquisition of the Rancho Paraiso Oasis from a seller who is not merely liquidating real estate — he is parting with a life project.

The seller invested approximately $30M over time to build this property. He is selling at a significant loss ($11.9M asking price) under personal duress (divorce). He is likely financially secure, meaning the economics of the sale are secondary to the meaning of it. This creates a rare opportunity to structure a deal that transcends conventional acquisition mechanics and enters the territory of legacy, stewardship, and shared purpose.

### The Core Insight

A seller who built something with his hands, invested $30M, and is now forced to let go for $10–12M does not want to feel like he lost. He wants to feel like what he built will be honored — and, ideally, elevated.

Our structures are designed to create exactly that feeling while maintaining absolute founder control over vision, operations, IP, and long-term upside.

### Strategy Overview

| | Strategy 1 | Strategy 2 | Strategy 3 |
|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Name** | The Legacy Steward | The Evolution | The Partnership of Purpose |
| **Character** | Seller carries the note + keeps a piece of the land forever | Seller becomes the bank + earns from the operating success | Seller reinvests alongside founders as a committed partner |
| **Cash at Close** | $3.0M | $2.0–2.5M | $2.0M |
| **Seller Note** | $7.0–8.0M | $8.0–9.0M | $6.0–7.0M |
| **Seller Equity (RE)** | 10% non-controlling | 0% | 8% non-controlling |
| **Seller OpCo Participation** | Advisory role (symbolic) | 3–5% profit participation (economic) | 2–3% equity (real ownership) |
| **Seller's Emotional Frame** | "Your name lives on in the land" | "You built the foundation for something extraordinary" | "You're not selling — you're joining" |
| **Total Seller Value (5-Year)** | $14.5–16.5M | $15.0–18.0M | $16.0–20.0M+ |
| **Best For** | Seller who wants connection without involvement | Seller who wants passive income and validation | Seller who wants purpose and active engagement |

---

## 2. Strategic Context — The Seller

### 2.1 Seller Profile

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Property Investment** | ~$30M over time (personal life project) |
| **Asking Price** | $11.9M (negotiation target: $10–11M) |
| **Implied Loss** | ~$19–20M on original investment |
| **Reason for Sale** | Divorce — forced disposition |
| **Emotional State** | Detached from the asset, not from its meaning |
| **Financial Position** | Likely multi-millionaire or billionaire; does not need the cash urgently |
| **Psychological Need** | Legacy, relevance, purpose, recognition |
| **Risk of Conventional Offer** | A clean cash offer feels like loss. A structured deal that honors his contribution feels like evolution. |

### 2.2 Strategic Psychology

The seller is experiencing three simultaneous losses:

1. **Financial loss** — Selling a $30M investment for $10–12M
2. **Identity loss** — The property was a personal expression; a divorce is stripping it away
3. **Legacy loss** — If sold to a developer or hotel chain, everything he built gets rebranded and repurposed

Our strategies address all three:

1. **Financial**: Seller financing at attractive rates provides yield income superior to passive alternatives — without the emotional emptiness of a wire transfer
2. **Identity**: The seller remains connected to the property through equity, participation, or named recognition
3. **Legacy**: The property is not demolished or commoditized — it is elevated into something with global impact

### 2.3 What the Seller Should Feel

> "I didn't sell my dream. I evolved it. What I built is becoming something that changes lives. And I'm still part of it."

This is not manipulation. This is genuine alignment. The Transformational Epicenter will honor and elevate what this man built. These structures ensure he benefits from that elevation — financially, emotionally, and symbolically.

### 3.4 Cash Flow Available for Seller Debt Service

This is the critical number for seller financing feasibility. The project generates substantial free cash flow from Year 1 onward.

| **5-Year Total** | **$49,643,382** | | | **$41,593,382** |

> **Source:** Cash Flow tab

**Debt Service Coverage Analysis:**

Even with $8M in seller financing at 8% ($640K annual interest), Year 1 FCF of $3.2M provides a **5.0x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)**. By Year 3, DSCR exceeds **14x**. The project can comfortably service seller debt from operations without external refinancing.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Principles

These principles apply across all three strategies. They are absolute.

### 4.1 Founder Control

| Domain | Requirement |
|--------|------------|
| Vision & Strategy | 100% founder authority; no seller veto on direction |
| Operations | 100% founder authority; seller has no management rights |
| IP, AI, Brand, Data, Protocols | Held in TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman); outside all seller instruments |
| Hiring & Personnel | 100% founder authority |
| Expansion Decisions | 100% founder authority |

### 4.2 IP Protection

All intellectual property, AI systems, clinical protocols, brand assets, anonymized outcome databases, and technology platforms are held in **TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman Islands)** — a separate entity from the real estate vehicle. The seller's participation (equity, debt, or otherwise) attaches to the **real estate entity** or to a **profit participation right** in the OpCo. At no point does the seller acquire ownership of, security interest in, or licensing rights to any IP.

> **Source:** `docs/strategy/OPTIMAL_CAPITAL_STRUCTURE.md` — Section 2.2 (IP Protection Framework)

### 4.3 Seller Participation Boundaries

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
|---------|------------|
| Non-controlling minority RE equity | Controlling interest in any entity |
| Profit participation in OpCo (economic right only) | Equity in TE Wellness Holdings above 5% |
| Advisory or honorary board role | Operational decision-making authority |
| Named recognition on property | Veto rights over business decisions |
| Annual reporting and transparency | Access to proprietary IP, data, or protocols |
| First-lien security on property (for debt) | Security interest in IP or operating company assets |

### 4.4 Entity Structure Integration

All seller instruments are designed to integrate cleanly with the existing 10-entity architecture. The seller's participation attaches at the **TE Real Estate Holdings** level (for RE equity and debt) and at the **TE Wellness Holdings** level (for OpCo profit participation), both via clearly bounded instruments with no downstream control.

## 5. Strategy 1: The Legacy Steward — Seller Carry + Legacy Equity

### Character

**The seller carries the majority of the purchase price as a secured note and retains a permanent, non-controlling minority stake in the real estate entity. He is the steward whose vision lives on in the land itself. His name is inscribed. His connection endures. His economics are attractive. His involvement is minimal.**

This strategy is designed for a seller who wants to remain emotionally connected but does not want operational involvement. He wants to know his property is in good hands, receive predictable income, and see his legacy honored.

---

### 5.1 Transaction Structure Overview

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Purchase Price** | $10,500,000 (negotiated from $11.9M) |

| **Total to Seller** | **$10,500,000** | |

**Post-Closing Capital Deployment:**

**Total Raise Required:** ~$12.4M from investors ($3M RE + ~$4.9M OpCo + remaining via blended instruments)

### 5.3 Seller Note Terms

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Principal** | $7,500,000 |
| **Interest Rate** | 7.5% annual, fixed |
| **Payment Structure** | Interest-only for 24 months; amortizing principal + interest months 25–60 |

| **Financial Covenant** | Minimum 1.5x DSCR maintained quarterly |

### 5.4 Seller Note Cash Flow to Seller

| Year | Payment Type | Annual Payment | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Year 1 | Interest only | $562,500 | $562,500 |
| Year 2 | Interest only | $562,500 | $1,125,000 |
| Year 3 | Principal + Interest (amortizing) | ~$1,800,000 | $2,925,000 |
| Year 4 | Principal + Interest (amortizing) | ~$1,800,000 | $4,725,000 |
| Year 5 | Balloon (remaining principal + interest) | ~$4,200,000 | $8,925,000 |

**Total Note Payments Over 5 Years:** ~$8,925,000 on $7,500,000 principal (19% total return)

**DSCR Analysis:**

| Year 5 | $12,782,595 | $4,200,000 | **3.0x** |

The project comfortably services the seller note at all times. Year 5 balloon can be funded from retained cash ($26.3M cumulative ending cash per Cash Flow tab) or conventional refinancing.

### 5.5 Seller Legacy Equity (10%)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Stake** | 10% non-controlling interest in TE Real Estate Holdings |
| **Voting Rights** | None (non-voting units) |
| **Distribution Rights** | 10% of distributions from RE entity after debt service and reserves |
| **Transfer Restrictions** | Subject to ROFR by founders; no transfer without founder consent |
| **Buy-Out Option** | Founders may purchase at FMV after Year 5 (optional, not mandatory) |
| **Tag-Along** | Yes — seller may participate in any sale of RE entity |
| **Information Rights** | Annual property financial statement; annual independent appraisal |
| **Governance** | No board seat; no veto rights; quarterly written update from founders |

**Illustrative Value of 10% RE Equity:**

The property is acquired at $10.5M. With Tulum appreciation of 8–12% annually and the value created by medical conversion and villa development, the underlying RE value is projected to reach $25–40M by Year 5. The seller's 10% could be worth $2.5–4.0M, in addition to all note payments received.

### 5.6 Seller Economics Summary (Strategy 1)

| Component | Value | Timing |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Cash at Close | $3,000,000 | Day 1 |
| Interest Payments (Years 1–2) | $1,125,000 | Quarterly over 24 months |
| Principal + Interest (Years 3–5) | $7,800,000 | Monthly, months 25–60 |
| RE Equity Value (10% at Year 5) | $2,500,000–$4,000,000 | Ongoing; liquid via buy-out or tag-along |
| **Total 5-Year Value to Seller** | **$14,425,000–$15,925,000** | |

The seller receives $14.4–15.9M in total value on a $10.5M sale — a **37–52% total return** over 5 years, plus permanent equity upside. This significantly outperforms passive alternatives (treasuries, bonds, even diversified portfolios).

### 5.7 Founder Economics and Control

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RE Equity Ownership | 90% (after 10% seller legacy equity) |
| RE Voting Control | 100% (seller holds non-voting units) |
| OpCo Equity (TE Wellness Holdings) | Per investor strategy (70–75% minimum) |
| IP Ownership | 100% (Cayman; outside RE entity entirely) |
| Management Authority | 100% (no seller management rights) |
| Annual Note Service (Years 1–2) | $562,500 (1.7% of Year 1 revenue) |
| Buy-Out Optionality | May purchase seller's 10% at FMV after Year 5 |

### 5.8 Seller Protections

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| First-lien security | Mortgage on property via fideicomiso — seller is first in line |
| Quarterly interest payments | Cash income beginning Quarter 1 |
| Financial covenant (1.5x DSCR) | Early warning system if operations underperform |
| 90-day cure period + forced sale | Ultimate backstop: seller can force property sale to recover capital |
| Annual independent appraisal | Ongoing LTV monitoring |
| 10% equity provides alignment | Seller benefits from property appreciation alongside founders |
| Tag-along rights | If founders sell the RE entity, seller participates on same terms |

### 5.9 Emotional and Legacy Framing

**How this is presented to the seller:**

> "We don't want to buy your property. We want to become its next stewards."

- **Named recognition:** A physical plaque or installation on the property honoring the seller as the original builder — "Built by [Seller Name], [Year]. Stewardship continues."
- **Legacy Steward title:** The seller is invited to hold the honorary title of "Founding Steward" with an open invitation to visit the property annually as a guest
- **Quarterly narrative updates:** Not just financials — a personal letter from founders describing how the property is evolving, the lives being changed, the programs being delivered
- **Permanent equity connection:** The 10% stake means the seller is not a former owner — he is a current participant. His wealth grows as the property grows. His legacy is not sold; it is compounding.

**Why this is compelling for the seller:**

- He receives more total value ($14.4–15.9M) than a clean $10.5M cash sale
- He maintains a permanent connection to what he built
- He receives predictable, secured income for 5 years
- His property becomes something greater than a hotel — it becomes a healing destination
- He is honored, not forgotten
- He has downside protection (first-lien security on property he knows intimately)

### 5.10 Why This Remains a Strong Deal for Founders and Investors

- **$3M cash at close** preserves maximum capital for operations
- **7.5% interest rate** is below private lending market rates (10–12% typical)
- **Interest-only period** (24 months) matches the operating ramp — no principal pressure during build-out
- **Seller's 10% is non-controlling, non-voting** — creates zero governance burden
- **First-lien is on the property only** — no access to IP, OpCo, or operating cash
- **DSCR coverage of 5.7x in Year 1** — enormous safety margin
- **Legacy framing reduces negotiation friction** — seller is less likely to push on price if he feels honored

---

## 6. Strategy 2: The Evolution — Seller as the Bank + Profit Participation

### Character

**The seller carries the largest possible note and receives no equity in the RE entity. Instead, he earns a profit participation right in the operating company — a share of the economic success of what his property becomes. He is the banker whose building became a transformation center. His return scales with the project's success.**

This strategy is designed for a seller who cares more about income and validation than ownership. He wants to see financial proof that his property is thriving. He wants cash flow. He wants to know his building enabled something extraordinary.

|-----------|-------------|
| Cash at Close | $2,000,000–$2,500,000 |
| Note Payments (P+I) | ~$9,940,000 |
| Profit Participation (Years 2–5) | ~$2,590,000 |
| **5-Year Total** | **$14,530,000–$15,030,000** |
| Profit Participation (Years 6–11, estimated) | ~$2,410,000 (to $5M cap) |
| **Lifetime Total** | **$16,940,000–$17,440,000** |

### 6.6 Seller Economics Summary (Strategy 2)

| Component | Value | Timing |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Cash at Close | $2,000,000–$2,500,000 | Day 1 |
| Note Interest (Yr 1–2) | $1,740,000 | Quarterly |
| Note Amortization + Balloon (Yr 3–5) | $8,200,000 | Monthly/Balloon |
| Profit Participation (10-year) | Up to $5,000,000 | Semi-annual |
| **Total Lifetime Value** | **$16,940,000–$17,440,000** | |

The seller receives up to $17.4M on a $10M sale — a **69–74% total return** over the life of the instruments. His return is partially correlated with the operating success of the project — if the project thrives (which it is projected to), he thrives.

### 6.7 Founder Economics and Control

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RE Equity Ownership | 100% |
| RE Voting Control | 100% |
| OpCo Equity (TE Wellness Holdings) | Per investor strategy (70–75% minimum) |
| IP Ownership | 100% (Cayman; seller has zero access) |
| Management Authority | 100% |
| Year 1 Total Seller Obligation | $640,000 (2.0% of Year 1 revenue) |
| Profit Participation Impact | 4% of EBITDA; ~$436K/yr starting Year 2 |
| Buy-Out Option | Can extinguish profit participation at any time at PV |

### 6.8 Seller Protections

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| First-lien on property | Same as Strategy 1 |
| Quarterly interest payments | Income from Day 1 |
| Profit participation upside | If project succeeds, seller earns more |
| $5M cap provides certainty | Both sides know the maximum exposure |
| Semi-annual audited EBITDA | Transparency into operating performance |
| Forced sale right on default | Ultimate backstop |
| Buy-out right (at PV) | Liquidity option if seller wants to exit participation early |

### 6.9 Emotional and Legacy Framing

**How this is presented to the seller:**

> "You built the foundation. We're building the future on top of it. And as the future grows, so does your return."

- **Profit participation creates alignment:** The seller's income grows as the project succeeds. He has a financial incentive to root for the project — and to tell people about it
- **"Builder's Return":** Frame the profit participation as a "Builder's Return" — a recognition that the physical structure he created is generating ongoing value
- **Annual impact report:** Send the seller an annual report showing guest outcomes, lives changed, programs delivered — alongside his financial statements. He sees both the money and the meaning.
- **No equity = no complexity:** The seller doesn't need to worry about governance, voting, or corporate matters. He receives checks.

**Why this is compelling for the seller:**

- Highest total lifetime return ($17.4M) of Strategies 1 and 2
- Income grows with the project's success (profit participation)
- Clean — no equity complexity, no governance responsibilities
- Predictable note income plus variable profit upside
- Emotional satisfaction of seeing his building generate healing and transformation
- He can truthfully say: "I built that place. And I still earn from it."

### 6.10 Why This Remains a Strong Deal for Founders and Investors

- **100% RE equity from Day 1** — no seller equity to manage or buy out
- **Profit participation is capped** ($5M) — total cost is known and bounded
- **4% of EBITDA is manageable** — ~$436K in Year 2 on $10.9M EBITDA (4.0%)
- **Buy-out option** provides founders the ability to extinguish participation when convenient
- **No governance rights** — seller receives economic participation only
- **Lower cash at close** ($2–2.5M) preserves more capital for operations
- **Builder's Return framing reduces price sensitivity** — seller focuses on total value, not headline price

## 7. Strategy 3: The Partnership of Purpose — Seller Roll-Over + Full Integration

### Character

**The seller carries a note, reinvests a portion of proceeds back into renovations, retains equity in both the RE entity and the OpCo, and joins as an advisory board member. This is the deepest integration — the seller becomes a partner in the project's future. He does not leave; he evolves.**

This strategy is designed for a seller who is seeking purpose, engagement, and relevance. He is bored. He is under-stimulated. He wants to be part of something meaningful. This structure gives him that — with clear boundaries.

---

### 7.1 Transaction Structure Overview

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Purchase Price** | $10,000,000 (negotiated from $11.9M) |
| **Cash at Close** | $2,000,000 (from investor capital) |
| **Seller Note** | $6,000,000 secured promissory note |
| **Seller Roll-Over (Renovation Investment)** | $2,000,000 reinvested into property renovations |
| **Seller RE Equity** | 8% non-controlling interest in TE Real Estate Holdings (earned via roll-over) |
| **Seller OpCo Equity** | 2.5% non-controlling interest in TE Wellness Holdings |
| **Advisory Role** | Paid advisory board member ($50,000/year + annual retreat invitation) |

### 7.2 Capital Flows — Who Pays What, When

**At Closing:**

| Source | Amount | Destination |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Investor capital | $2,000,000 | Seller (cash at close) |
| Seller financing (note) | $6,000,000 | Retained as secured obligation |
| Seller roll-over (renovation) | $2,000,000 | Directly into renovation fund |
| **Total Transaction** | **$10,000,000** | |

**The $2M Roll-Over Mechanism:**

Instead of receiving $10M in total value at close ($2M cash + $8M note), the seller elects to reduce the note to $6M and redirect $2M back into the project as a renovation investment. In exchange, he receives:
- 8% non-controlling equity in TE Real Estate Holdings (valued against renovation contribution)
- 2.5% non-controlling equity in TE Wellness Holdings (sweat equity recognition)
- Advisory board seat with compensation

This structure accomplishes two things simultaneously:
1. **Reduces the seller note** from $8M to $6M — lowering founder debt service obligations
2. **Gives the seller skin in the game** — he is now a co-investor, not just a creditor

### 7.3 Seller Note Terms

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Principal** | $6,000,000 |
| **Interest Rate** | 7.0% annual, fixed (lower rate reflects seller's equity alignment) |
| **Payment Structure** | Interest-only for 24 months; amortizing months 25–60 |
| **Balloon Payment** | Remaining balance due at Month 60 |
| **Security** | First-position lien on property via fideicomiso |

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Stake | 8% non-controlling, non-voting units |
| Distribution Rights | 8% of RE entity distributions after debt service and reserves |
| Transfer | Subject to ROFR by founders |
| Buy-Out | Founders may purchase at FMV after Year 5 |
| Tag-Along | Yes |
| Information | Annual RE financial statement and appraisal |

**OpCo Equity (2.5% in TE Wellness Holdings):**

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Stake | 2.5% non-controlling, non-voting preferred units |
| Distribution Rights | 2.5% of OpCo distributions after preferred return to investors |
| Vesting | Immediate (fully vested at closing) |
| Transfer | Subject to ROFR by founders |
| Buy-Out | Founders may purchase at FMV after Year 5 |

| Compensation | $50,000/year (paid quarterly) |
| Term | 3-year initial term; renewable by mutual consent |

| Removal | Either party may terminate with 90-day notice |

### 7.6 Combined Seller Cash Flows

**Seller Note Payments:**

| Year | Payment Type | Annual Payment |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Year 1 | Interest only | $420,000 |
| Year 2 | Interest only | $420,000 |
| Year 3 | Principal + Interest (amortizing) | ~$1,600,000 |
| Year 4 | Principal + Interest (amortizing) | ~$1,600,000 |
| Year 5 | Balloon (remaining principal + interest) | ~$3,100,000 |
| **5-Year Note Total** | | **~$7,140,000** |

**Advisory Compensation:**

| Year | Annual Payment |
|------|---------------|
| Years 1–5 | $50,000/year |
| **5-Year Total** | **$250,000** |

**Equity Value at Year 5:**

| Holding | Basis | Estimated Year 5 Value |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| 8% TE RE Holdings | Property appreciation + villa program value | $2,000,000–$3,200,000 |
| 2.5% TE Wellness Holdings | Enterprise value of ~$147M x 2.5% | $3,675,000 |
| **Total Equity Value** | | **$5,675,000–$6,875,000** |

### 7.7 Seller Economics Summary (Strategy 3)

| Component | Value | Timing |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Cash at Close | $2,000,000 | Day 1 |
| Note Payments (P+I over 5 years) | $7,140,000 | Quarterly/Monthly |
| Advisory Compensation (5 years) | $250,000 | Quarterly |
| RE Equity Value (8% at Year 5) | $2,000,000–$3,200,000 | Ongoing |
| OpCo Equity Value (2.5% at Year 5) | $3,675,000 | Ongoing |
| **Total 5-Year Value** | **$15,065,000–$16,265,000** | |
| **Including equity fair value** | **$16,065,000–$19,940,000+** | |

The seller receives $16–20M in total value on a $10M sale — potentially the **highest total return** of all three strategies, driven by equity upside in a $147M enterprise. His 2.5% OpCo stake alone could be worth $3.7M at Year 5 valuations.

### 7.8 Founder Economics and Control

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RE Equity Ownership | 92% |
| RE Voting Control | 100% (seller holds non-voting units) |
| OpCo Equity (TE Wellness Holdings) | ~67.5–72.5% (after 2.5% to seller) |
| IP Ownership | 100% (Cayman; seller has zero IP access) |
| Management Authority | 100% (advisory role is advisory only) |
| Year 1 Total Seller Obligation | $470,000 ($420K note + $50K advisory) — 1.5% of revenue |
| Seller Note is smallest | $6M vs. $7.5–8M in other strategies |
| Advisory cost | $50K/year is negligible against $10.3M Year 1 revenue |

### 7.9 Seller Protections

| Protection | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| First-lien on property | Same security as other strategies |
| Equity upside in both vehicles | Seller benefits from property AND operating success |
| $2M reinvestment directly improves property value | Seller's renovation capital enhances his own equity value |
| Advisory compensation provides income floor | $50K/year regardless of distributions |
| Annual on-site visit | Seller sees his property in person, annually |
| Tag-along on both equity positions | Protected in any sale event |
| Buy-out rights at FMV | Liquidity option after Year 5 |

### 7.10 Emotional and Legacy Framing

**How this is presented to the seller:**

> "You're not selling your property. You're joining a mission. You built the body. We're bringing it to life. And you'll be here to see it — as a partner, an advisor, and a friend."

- **The deepest emotional connection:** Seller has equity in both the land and the operating company. His wealth grows as lives are changed.
- **Advisory role provides purpose:** Quarterly calls, annual visits, and a real title give a bored, under-stimulated man something to care about
- **Renovation reinvestment is powerful symbolism:** The seller is literally investing back into his own creation — he is not walking away, he is upgrading
- **"Founding Steward" title is permanent:** Even after the advisory term ends, the title remains. His name is on the wall. His legacy is in the corporate documents.
- **Annual retreat stay:** He returns to his property as an honored guest — not a former owner. He sees the gardens he planted being tended. He sees guests being healed in rooms he designed.

**Why this is compelling for the seller:**

- Highest potential total return ($16–20M+)
- Deepest personal connection to the project
- Real purpose and engagement (advisory role)
- His $2M reinvestment makes the property better — and increases his own equity value
- He can introduce the project to his network with genuine enthusiasm (he's an owner)
- His divorce narrative shifts from loss to evolution: "I let go of the property, but I gained something bigger."

### 7.11 Why This Remains a Strong Deal for Founders and Investors

- **Smallest seller note** ($6M vs. $7.5–8M) — lowest debt service obligation
- **$2M renovation reinvestment** directly reduces capital needed from outside investors
- **7.0% interest rate** (lowest of all strategies) reflects seller's equity alignment
- **2.5% OpCo dilution is minimal** on a $147M enterprise
- **Advisory compensation ($50K/year) is negligible** — and the seller's network could generate referrals worth multiples of the cost
- **Seller as advocate:** An equity-holding, advisory-board-sitting, annually-visiting seller becomes the project's most authentic external champion
- **Reduced negotiation friction:** A seller who becomes a partner has dramatically less incentive to fight on price

| Wants purpose, engagement, and to be part of something bigger | **Strategy 3: Partnership of Purpose** |
| Needs maximum cash at close | Strategy 1 (highest cash: $3M) |
| Price-sensitive / wants lowest headline price | Strategy 2 or 3 ($10M vs. $10.5M) |
| Tax-sensitive / wants to spread income | Strategy 2 (profit participation over 10 years) |
| Wants to impress peers / have a "story" | **Strategy 3** (he's an advisor/partner in a healing center) |

---

## 9. Seller Conversation Framework

### 9.1 Opening the Conversation

Do not lead with numbers. Lead with story.

**Phase 1: Recognition (5–10 minutes)**

> "Before we talk about anything else, we want you to know that we've studied every detail of what you built here. We've walked the grounds. We've seen the cenotes. We understand what this place represents — not as a property, but as a vision. You didn't build a hotel. You built a sanctuary. And that's exactly why we're here."

**Phase 2: Our Vision (10 minutes)**

> "We're building something that doesn't exist yet — a world-class medical wellness center where people come to heal. Not a spa. Not a resort. A place where someone battling depression, addiction, or trauma can arrive broken and leave whole. Your property is the only place we've found that can hold this vision. The jungle, the cenotes, the privacy, the scale — it's perfect. And it's perfect because of what you created."

**Phase 3: The Invitation (5 minutes)**

> "We could make you a simple offer and walk away. But that doesn't feel right. What you built deserves more than a wire transfer. We want to talk about how you might remain connected to this place — how your legacy continues, and how you benefit as it grows."

### 9.2 Presenting the Structure

Present ONE strategy at a time based on the seller's personality read. Do not present all three simultaneously.

- If the seller seems emotionally attached but low-energy: **Strategy 1**
- If the seller seems pragmatic and income-focused: **Strategy 2**
- If the seller seems restless, bored, and seeking purpose: **Strategy 3**

### 9.3 Handling Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|---------|
| "I need more cash at close" | Increase cash by $500K–$1M; reduce note accordingly. All strategies have flexibility. |
| "The interest rate is too low" | "We're offering you something no bank can: permanent connection to your creation. The rate reflects a partnership, not a transaction." Offer 0.5% increase if necessary. |
| "I don't want any involvement" | Strategy 2 (zero equity, zero governance). "You receive checks. Nothing else is required." |
| "I want more equity" | Move from 10% to 12–15% RE equity (max). Do NOT increase OpCo above 5%. |
| "I want a seat on the board" | Advisory board (non-voting) only. Never a formal board seat with governance authority. |
| "What if you can't pay the note?" | "Your loan is secured by the property you built. You know its value better than anyone. If anything goes wrong, you get your property back." |
| "I invested $30M — this price is too low" | "The $30M you invested built something priceless. We're honoring that with a structure that gives you ongoing participation in its future. The total value to you over 5 years significantly exceeds the cash price." |

---

## 10. Legal and Structural Integration

### 10.1 Fideicomiso Implications

The seller note is secured by a first-position lien on the property held within the fideicomiso (50-year renewable bank trust). Under Mexican law:

- The fideicomiso beneficiary (TE RE Acquisition & Development Mexico, S.A. de C.V.) can pledge beneficial interest as security
- The seller's security interest attaches to the beneficial interest in the fideicomiso, not to the bank trustee's bare legal title
- Enforcement requires Mexican legal proceedings but is well-established under the Foreign Investment Law and Banking Law
- The fideicomiso itself cannot be revoked or modified without beneficiary consent — protecting both the seller's security and the founders' beneficial ownership

> **Source:** `docs/data-room/legal/16-fideicomiso-structure.md`

### 10.2 Entity-Level Documentation Required

| Document | Purpose | Responsible Party |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| Promissory Note | Seller financing terms; principal, interest, repayment schedule | Mexican counsel |
| Mortgage/Hipoteca Registration | First-lien security against property within fideicomiso | Mexican counsel + bank trustee |
| RE Holdings Operating Agreement Amendment | Seller equity participation (Strategies 1 and 3) | Corporate counsel |
| OpCo Equity Grant Agreement | Seller OpCo equity (Strategy 3) | Cayman counsel |
| Profit Participation Agreement | Seller EBITDA participation (Strategy 2) | Corporate counsel |
| Advisory Board Agreement | Advisory role terms (Strategy 3) | Corporate counsel |
| Fideicomiso Amendment | Consent for mortgage registration by bank trustee | Mexican counsel + bank trustee |
| Transfer Pricing Documentation | Intercompany flows supporting debt service | Tax counsel |

### 10.3 Tax Implications for the Seller

| Jurisdiction | Consideration |
|-------------|--------------|
| Mexico | Interest income from seller note is subject to Mexican withholding tax (varies by treaty). Profit participation may be classified as royalty or service income. Requires Mexican tax counsel review. |
| Seller's Home Jurisdiction | Capital gain on sale; installment sale treatment may apply to defer recognition. Interest income taxable as ordinary income. Equity grants may trigger income recognition. |
| Withholding | Mexico imposes withholding on interest payments to foreign lenders (25% default; reduced by applicable tax treaty). Structure should optimize for applicable treaties. |

### 10.4 Securities Considerations

- Seller equity in the RE entity and OpCo constitutes a securities issuance — requires applicable exemption (private placement)
- Profit participation agreement may or may not constitute a security depending on jurisdiction — structure as a contractual commercial arrangement to minimize securities classification risk
- Seller note is a debt instrument, not a security, when issued in connection with a property sale — but review with securities counsel

## 11. Risk Analysis

### 11.1 Risks to Founders

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Seller demands higher interest rate | Medium | Low | Budget supports up to 10% comfortably; DSCR remains >3x |
| Seller demands more equity | Medium | Medium | Hard cap at 15% RE and 5% OpCo; non-voting only |
| Seller exercises forced sale right | Very Low | High | DSCR coverage of 5.7x Year 1; 14x Year 3. Default is extremely unlikely. |
| Seller becomes problematic advisor (Strategy 3) | Low | Low | 90-day termination clause; advisory is non-binding |
| Seller's divorce proceedings complicate closing | Medium | Medium | Require clear title and divorce court approval before closing |
| Seller attempts to influence operations via equity | Low | Medium | Non-voting units; no management rights; clear operating agreement |

### 11.2 Risks to Seller

|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Project fails; founders default on note | Very Low | Medium | First-lien security on property; seller gets property back |
| Property depreciates | Very Low | Medium | Tulum appreciation 8–12%/yr; $2M+ renovation investment enhances value |
| Founders dilute seller equity | Low | Low | Anti-dilution protection; ROFR on additional issuances |
| Profit participation underperforms | Low | Low | Conservative EBITDA projections; 83% gross margins provide buffer |
| Founders refuse to pay out advisory fees | Very Low | Very Low | Contractual obligation; immaterial amount |
