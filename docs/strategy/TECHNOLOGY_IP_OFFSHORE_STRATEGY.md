## 1. Why Tech Is the Ultimate Tax-Free Asset

Physical assets — clinics, real estate, medical equipment — are chained to a jurisdiction. They exist somewhere, and that somewhere taxes them. You can't move a building.

Technology is different. Software, algorithms, AI models, databases, and digital platforms have **no physical location**. They are:

- **Weightless** — Can be hosted anywhere on Earth
- **Borderless** — Can be accessed from any country
- **Replicable** — Can serve infinite locations with zero marginal cost
- **Ownable by any entity** — The legal owner determines where tax is paid

This is exactly why Apple earned $74B through Ireland paying an effective tax rate of 0.005%. Why Google routed $23B through the Netherlands paying near zero. Why Microsoft, Facebook, and every major tech company parks their IP offshore.

The mechanism is simple:

1. A company in a **low-tax jurisdiction** owns the technology
2. Operating companies in **high-tax jurisdictions** pay that company to use it
3. The payments are **deductible** in the high-tax country (reducing local tax)
4. The income arrives in the **low-tax country** and is barely taxed
5. What's left flows up to the ultimate owner — tax-free

TE's technology platform, AI models, clinical algorithms, and anonymized data assets are **perfectly suited** for this structure. And because the tech hasn't been built yet, we can set it up correctly from day one — no messy IP transfers, no retroactive restructuring, no transfer pricing challenges on migration.

## 2. What Apple and Google Did (And How We Do It Better) {#2-what-apple-and-google-did}

### 2.1 The Apple Model

Apple created **Apple Operations International (AOI)** and **Apple Sales International (ASI)** in Ireland. Through a cost-sharing agreement with Apple Inc. (US), ASI co-developed IP and received economic rights to Apple's IP for territories outside the Americas.

Every Apple product sold outside the US generated revenue that flowed through ASI in Ireland. Result: Apple paid **less than 2% tax** on $74B in offshore profits over 4 years.

**What we learn:** Cost-sharing agreements let an offshore entity co-own IP from inception. The IP doesn't need to be "transferred" — it's developed jointly from the start.

### 2.2 The Google Model (Double Irish, Dutch Sandwich)

Google licensed IP from the US parent to **Google Ireland Holdings** (an Irish company managed from Bermuda — therefore tax-resident nowhere under old Irish rules). Revenue from all non-US operations flowed through Ireland. Royalties were paid from Google Ireland Ltd → Google Netherlands Holdings BV → Google Ireland Holdings (Bermuda-managed) → effectively 0% tax.

**What we learn:** The routing through Netherlands eliminated Irish withholding tax on royalties. The "managed from Bermuda" trick closed in 2020, but the principle of treaty routing to eliminate WHT still works — you just need real substance now.

### 2.3 How We Do It Better

The old tricks (Double Irish, Dutch Sandwich, stateless Irish companies) are **closed**. But the OECD's new framework, ironically, created even better opportunities for companies that do it right:

| Old World (Pre-2020) | New World (2025+) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Shell companies with no employees | Real substance required, but **IP Box regimes** reward it |
| Stateless entities exploiting mismatches | Entities must be tax-resident somewhere, but **5-10% IP tax rates** are available |
| Paper-only cost-sharing agreements | DEMPE functions must be real, but if they ARE real, **IP income is taxed at 5-10%** |
| Challenged by tax authorities constantly | **OECD-compliant IP regimes are designed to be used** — they WANT you to bring IP |

**The key insight:** Governments now compete for IP income by offering low rates on qualifying IP. Singapore, UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malaysia — they are **inviting** you to house your IP there. The rates are 5-10%, they're OECD-compliant, and they're designed to withstand scrutiny.

We don't need to hide the tech. We need to **put it where they want it and play by their rules.**

## 3. The TE Technology Stack: What We're Offshoring {#3-the-te-technology-stack}

### 3.1 IP Asset Inventory

| Asset | Category | Estimated Value (Year 5) | Licensing Revenue Potential |
|-------|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **AI Personalization Engine** | Software / Algorithm | $3-5M | Licensing to every TE location + third parties |
| **Pharmacogenomic Dosing Platform** | Software / Database | $2-4M | Per-patient licensing fees |
| **Clinical Protocol Library** | Trade Secrets / Know-how | $1-3M | Royalties from every location |
| **14-System Integrated Platform** | Software / Architecture | $3-5M (replacement cost: $7.5M) | SaaS licensing to every location |
| **Anonymized Outcome Database** | Database / Data Asset | $5-15M+ (grows annually) | Research licensing to pharma/academia |
| **Brain Mapping Analysis Algorithms** | Software / Algorithm | $1-3M | Per-scan licensing fees |
| **Guest Journey Mobile App** | Software / Copyright | $500K-1M | Per-location SaaS fees |
| **Screening & Risk Assessment Tools** | Software / Algorithm | $500K-1M | Per-patient fees |
| **Training & Certification Programs** | Copyright / Know-how | $500K-1M | Per-practitioner licensing |
| **Trademarks & Brand** | Trademark | $2-5M | Brand licensing fees per location |
| **Total Estimated IP Value (Year 5)** | | **$19-42M** | **$3-8M/year in licensing revenue** |

### 3.2 Revenue Model for Licensed Technology

When TE expands to multiple locations (owned or partnered), each location pays for access to the technology stack:

| Fee Type | Basis | Estimated Rate | Revenue (per location, Year 3+) |
|----------|-------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Platform SaaS License | Per location, monthly | $15-30K/month | $180-360K/year |
| AI Engine License | Per patient processed | $500-1,000/patient | $500K-1M/year |
| Clinical Protocol License | % of revenue | 3-5% of clinical revenue | $300K-500K/year |
| Data Analytics Access | Per location, monthly | $5-10K/month | $60-120K/year |
| Brand License | % of revenue | 2-3% of total revenue | $200-300K/year |
| Training & Certification | Per practitioner | $5-10K/person | $50-100K/year |
| **Total per location** | | | **$1.3-2.4M/year** |

With 5 locations at maturity: **$6.5-12M/year in technology licensing revenue**
With 10 locations: **$13-24M/year**

This is **pure profit flowing to the IP entity** — and if structured correctly, taxed at 5-10% instead of 25-30%.

## 4. The Golden Rule: Develop Offshore From Day One {#4-the-golden-rule}

### 4.1 Why Timing Matters

If you build the technology in Mexico (or the US, or Canada) and then "transfer" it to an offshore IP entity, every tax authority will:

1. Demand you pay tax on the transfer (exit tax / capital gains)
2. Challenge the transfer price (was it really arm's length?)
3. Argue the IP was developed using local resources (and should be taxed locally)
4. Apply DEMPE principles to claw back profits to the development country

**But if the IP entity exists FIRST and the technology is developed BY or FOR that entity from the beginning, there is no transfer.** The IP was always owned by the offshore entity. There is nothing to challenge.

### 4.2 Three Models for Offshore IP Development

#### Model A: Contract R&D (Commissionaire / Toll Developer)

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Advantages:**
- Cleanest ownership structure — IPCo owns 100% from day one
- Developers can be anywhere (hire the best talent globally)
- No IP transfer to challenge
- Well-established model used by thousands of multinationals

**Requirements:**
- IPCo must have substance: at minimum, a CTO or Tech Director employed by IPCo who directs the development, makes architectural decisions, and signs off on deliverables
- IPCo must fund the development (money flows from IPCo to developers)
- Contract must be arm's length (cost + 10-15% is typical for contract R&D)

#### Model B: Cost-Sharing Agreement (Joint Development)

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Advantages:**
- Mexican OpCo owns Mexico-territory IP (no royalty payment needed for Mexico)
- IPCo owns rest-of-world IP (all future expansion revenue flows to IPCo)
- Both parties share costs proportionally
- Apple used this exact model

**Requirements:**
- Buy-in payment if one party contributes pre-existing IP
- Proportional sharing must be based on reasonably anticipated benefits
- Requires annual true-up if actual benefits differ from projections
- More complex to administer than Model A

#### Model C: Full Offshore Development

```
All developers are employed directly by IPCo in Singapore/UK.
All development happens in Singapore/UK.
100% clean. Zero ambiguity.
```

**Advantages:** No transfer pricing questions at all. The IP was created entirely by IPCo employees in IPCo's jurisdiction.

**Disadvantages:** Must hire and manage a development team in Singapore or UK. Higher labor costs. Less practical for a startup.

### 4.3 Recommended Approach

**Start with Model A (Contract R&D)**, evolving to a mix of A and C as the company grows:

| Phase | Approach | Developers | IPCo Substance |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Year 0-1** | Model A | Contracted developers (Latam/Eastern Europe/wherever best) | 1 CTO/Tech Director employed by IPCo in SG/UK; directs all development |
| **Year 2-3** | Model A + C hybrid | Some contracted, some direct IPCo employees in SG/UK | 3-5 core engineers in SG/UK; contracted team for additional capacity |
| **Year 4+** | Model C primary | Core team in SG/UK; contracted team for overflow | Full R&D center in SG/UK; 10-20+ engineers |

The key: **Form IPCo and hire the CTO/Tech Director in Singapore or UK BEFORE any code is written.** Every line of code, every algorithm, every model is then developed under contract for (or directly by) IPCo.

## 5. IP Regime Comparison: Where to Park the Tech {#5-ip-regime-comparison}

### 5.1 Detailed Comparison

| Jurisdiction | IP Tax Rate | Headline Rate | Mexico Treaty | REFIPRE Safe | Qualifying IP | R&D Substance Needed | Outbound WHT | Annual Cost |
|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Singapore (IDI)** | **5%** | 17% | YES | Borderline (needs analysis) | Patents, software, processes | R&D activity in SG | **0%** on dividends | $15-30K + staff |
| **UK (Patent Box)** | **10%** | 25% | YES | **YES** | Patented inventions, software with patents | Development + UK patent | **0%** on dividends | $20-40K + staff |
| **Ireland (KDB)** | **6.25%** | 15% | YES | NO (15% < 22.5%) | Patents, copyrighted software | R&D in Ireland | 25% (but treaty reduces) | $30-50K + staff |
| **Luxembourg (IP Box)** | **4.99%** | 24.94% | YES | **YES** | Patents, software copyrights (NOT trademarks) | Nexus approach R&D | 15% (treaty reduces) | $40-80K + staff |
| **Malaysia (MD Status)** | **0%** | 24% | NO | N/A (no Mexico treaty) | AI, big data, IoT, cyber | Activity in Malaysia | 0% | $10-20K + staff |
| **Netherlands (Innovation Box)** | **9%** | 25.8% | YES | **YES** | Patents, R&D IP | R&D in NL; WBSO certificate | 15% (treaty reduces) | $30-60K + staff |

### 5.2 The Scoring Matrix

| Factor | Weight | Singapore | UK | Ireland | Luxembourg | Malaysia |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----|---------|------------|---------|
| IP tax rate | 25% | 5/5 (5%) | 4/5 (10%) | 5/5 (6.25%) | 5/5 (4.99%) | 5/5 (0%) |
| Mexico treaty / REFIPRE safety | 25% | 3/5 (borderline) | 5/5 (safe) | 2/5 (risky) | 5/5 (safe) | 1/5 (no treaty) |
| Outbound WHT to Panama PIF | 15% | 5/5 (0%) | 5/5 (0%) | 2/5 (25%) | 3/5 (15%) | 5/5 (0%) |
| Ease of substance | 15% | 4/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 |
| Quality of life for staff | 10% | 5/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 |
| Expansion hub potential | 10% | 5/5 (Asia) | 4/5 (global) | 3/5 (EU) | 3/5 (EU) | 4/5 (ASEAN) |
| **Weighted Score** | **100%** | **4.15** | **4.40** | **3.20** | **3.95** | **3.20** |

### 5.3 Recommendation

**Primary IPCo: UK (Patent Box) — 10% rate, REFIPRE safe, 0% outbound WHT, strong Mexico treaty**

This aligns perfectly with the Global Tax Optimization Strategy which already recommends a UK Treaty HoldCo. The IPCo can be a subsidiary of the UK HoldCo (or the same entity if structured as a division).

**Secondary consideration: Singapore** — If the REFIPRE question can be resolved favorably (Mexican counsel confirms Singapore's 17% headline rate is sufficient), Singapore's 5% IDI rate is superior. Singapore also positions TE for Asian expansion.

**Dual-jurisdiction approach (advanced):** UK IPCo for Mexico-facing licensing (REFIPRE safe), Singapore IPCo for non-Mexico global licensing (lower rate, no Mexico REFIPRE concern because the licensee is in a different country).

### 6.2 Why Three Separate IP Entities

| Entity | Asset Type | Tax Treatment | Rationale for Separation |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **TE Technology** | Software, algorithms, patents | 10% UK Patent Box | Highest value; qualifies for preferential rate |
| **TE Data Intelligence** | Databases, AI models, research | 10% Patent Box (if patented methods) or 25% standard | Different risk profile; independent revenue streams |
| **TE Brand** | Trademarks, domain names, brand | 25% UK standard (no IP Box for trademarks) | Different IP category; different licensing economics |

Alternatively, for simplicity at seed stage, combine all three into **one entity** (TE Technology Ltd) and separate later when revenue justifies the complexity.

## 7. The SaaS Advantage: Service Fees vs. Royalties {#7-the-saas-advantage}

### 7.1 The Characterization Game

How a cross-border technology payment is **characterized** — as a royalty, a service fee, or a business profit — fundamentally changes the tax treatment:

| Characterization | Mexico WHT | Deductible in Mexico? | REFIPRE Risk | Best For |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Royalty** (IP license) | 10% (UK treaty) | Yes | Must be REFIPRE-safe jurisdiction | Traditional IP licensing |
| **Service fee** (SaaS / cloud) | 25% (technical services) or 0% (business profits) | Yes | Potentially lower | Cloud-delivered technology |
| **Business profit** (under treaty) | 0% (if no PE in Mexico) | N/A | N/A | If characterized as business profit |

### 7.2 The SaaS / Cloud Delivery Model

The OECD and most jurisdictions are moving toward treating **cloud-delivered services (SaaS)** as service fees rather than royalties. The key distinction:

- **Royalty:** The customer gets a right to **use or copy** the software
- **Service fee:** The customer gets **access to functionality** delivered from the cloud; the software runs on the provider's servers

If TE Technology hosts its platform in the cloud and provides **access** (not a software license) to each TE location:

1. The Mexican OpCo accesses the platform via browser/API
2. No software is installed locally; no code is transferred
3. OpCo pays a monthly SaaS subscription fee
4. Under OECD principles, this is a **service payment**, not a royalty

### 7.3 Why This Matters for Mexico

Mexico's treaty network distinguishes between:
- **Royalties** (Article 12 of most treaties): 10% WHT under UK-Mexico treaty
- **Technical services / professional services**: 25% WHT (or potentially 0% if characterized as business profits under Article 7 with no PE)
- **Business profits** (Article 7): 0% WHT if the UK entity has no permanent establishment in Mexico

**The optimal characterization varies by specific circumstances.** If the SaaS payments can be classified as business profits (Article 7) with no Mexican PE, the WHT drops to **0%**. This requires:
- TE Technology Ltd has no employees in Mexico
- TE Technology Ltd has no fixed place of business in Mexico
- The platform is hosted outside Mexico (cloud servers in US/EU/SG)
- Support is provided remotely from the UK

**This is the most aggressive optimization: 0% WHT on tech payments out of Mexico, deductible in Mexico, taxed at 10% in the UK Patent Box.**

Needs specific analysis by Mexican and UK tax counsel on whether Mexico would accept this characterization.

## 8. Global Licensing Model: One Engine, Many Locations {#8-global-licensing-model}

### 8.1 The Franchise-Like Model

As TE expands globally, each new location becomes a licensee of the technology stack:

```
                    TE TECHNOLOGY LTD (UK)
                    "The Tech Engine"

### 8.2 Pricing Tiers

| Licensee Type | Clinical Protocol Royalty | SaaS Platform Fee | Data Analytics Fee | Brand License | Total |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Owned TE locations** | 3-5% of revenue | $15-30K/month | $5-10K/month | 2-3% of revenue | 5-8% + $20-40K/month |
| **Managed partnerships** | 5-8% of revenue | $20-40K/month | $10-15K/month | 3-5% of revenue | 8-13% + $30-55K/month |
| **Third-party licensees** | 8-12% of revenue | $30-50K/month | $15-25K/month | 5-7% of revenue | 13-19% + $45-75K/month |

### 8.3 Revenue at Scale

| Scenario | Locations | Avg Revenue/Location | Tech Revenue to IPCo | Tax at 10% (Patent Box) |
|----------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Year 3 | 2 owned | $15M avg | ~$2.4M | $240K |
| Year 5 | 3 owned + 2 partners | $20M avg | ~$6M | $600K |
| Year 7 | 5 owned + 5 partners | $25M avg | ~$15M | $1.5M |
| Year 10 | 5 owned + 15 licensed | $25M avg | ~$40M | **$4M** |

**Compare to 30% standard rate:** Year 10 tax would be $12M instead of $4M. **Savings: $8M/year.**

After the 10% UK tax, the remaining income flows through the UK HoldCo → Panama PIF with **0% additional tax** (UK has no outbound dividend WHT).

## 9. Money Flow: From Every TE Location to Zero Tax {#9-money-flow}

### 9.1 The Complete Tech Revenue Flow

```
STEP 1: TE Location (any country) generates revenue
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Revenue: $20M (example)
Local corporate tax: 30% (Mexico example)
Pays to TE Technology: royalty + SaaS fees (~8% of revenue = $1.6M)
    → Deductible locally (reduces 30% tax base by $480K)
    → WHT: 10% under treaty = $160K to local tax authority
    → Net to TE Technology: $1.44M

STEP 2: TE Technology Ltd (UK) receives licensing income
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gross income: $1.44M (from this one location)
UK Patent Box rate: 10%
Tax: $144K
Foreign tax credit for Mexican WHT: $160K (exceeds UK tax → carry forward)
Actual UK tax after FTC: potentially $0

Net to TE Technology: ~$1.44M

STEP 3: TE Technology → UK HoldCo → Panama PIF
────────────────────────────────────────────────
TE Technology pays dividend to UK HoldCo: 0% intra-UK
UK HoldCo pays dividend to Panama PIF: 0% UK outbound WHT
Panama PIF receives: $1.44M
Panama tax: 0%

STEP 4: Panama PIF → Founder
─────────────────────────────
Distribution to founder (Panama/UAE resident): 0% WHT
Founder personal income tax: 0% (territorial system)

NET RESULT:
├── Revenue: $1.6M in tech licensing
├── Total tax paid: $160K (Mexican WHT only — UK tax offset by FTC)
├── Effective rate on tech income: ~10%
├── Compared to: 30% (if kept in Mexico) or 50%+ (if routed to Canada)
└── Savings: $320K-$640K per year on this one revenue stream alone
```

### 9.2 The Data Revenue Flow (Even Better)

Data licensing to pharmaceutical companies and research institutions is NOT tied to any Mexican source. The data is processed and sold by TE Data Intelligence Ltd in the UK. The customers are in the US, EU, and globally.

```
Pharma company (US) pays TE Data Intelligence (UK) for anonymized dataset access

├── No Mexican source = No Mexican WHT
├── No connection to any TE location's operations
├── UK Patent Box: 10% (if methods are patented) or 25% standard
├── UK HoldCo → Panama PIF: 0%
├── PIF → Founder: 0%
├── Effective rate: 10-25% (no Mexican 30% layer at all)
```

**This is the highest-margin, lowest-tax revenue stream in the entire business.** Pure data and AI model licensing from a UK entity to global customers, with no source-country taxation.

---

## 10. The Data Monetization Machine {#10-the-data-monetization-machine}

### 10.1 Data as a Standalone Business

The anonymized dataset becomes independently valuable and monetizable. Revenue streams:

| Stream | Customer | Pricing Model | Year 3 Revenue | Year 5 Revenue |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Research data licensing** | Pharma, biotech, universities | Annual subscription ($50-200K/year per licensee) | $200K | $1M+ |
| **AI model API access** | Other clinics, wellness providers | Per-query or per-patient pricing | $100K | $500K+ |
| **Outcome benchmarking** | Insurance companies, government health agencies | Per-report or annual subscription | $50K | $300K+ |
| **Custom analytics** | Pharmaceutical companies conducting drug interaction studies | Project-based ($100-500K per study) | $150K | $500K+ |
| **Training data sets** | AI/ML companies in health tech | Dataset licensing ($50-500K per set) | $50K | $250K+ |
| **Total data revenue** | | | **$550K** | **$2.5M+** |

### 10.2 Tax Treatment of Data Revenue

Since data revenue flows directly to TE Data Intelligence Ltd (UK) from global customers — **not through any Mexican entity** — there is:

- No Mexican corporate tax (not Mexican-source income)
- No Mexican WHT (no payment from Mexico)
- No REFIPRE concern (no Mexico → foreign payment)
- Only UK tax at Patent Box rate (10%) if the analytics methodology is patented, or 25% standard otherwise
- Then 0% through to Panama PIF

**Effective tax rate on data revenue: 10-25%**

### 10.3 The Compounding Data Moat

```
Year 1:  387 guests × ~10K data points each = 3.9M data points
Year 2:  1,124 cumulative guests = 11.2M data points
Year 3:  2,112 cumulative guests = 21.1M data points
Year 5:  4,537 cumulative guests = 45.4M data points
Year 10: 10,000+ guests across multiple locations = 100M+ data points

Each data point makes the AI models more accurate.
Each improvement in accuracy makes the platform more valuable.
Each new location adds more data faster (network effect).

This dataset becomes the world's largest longitudinal database of
psychedelic-assisted therapy outcomes combined with pharmacogenomics.

Enterprise value of data asset alone (Year 10): $50-200M+
Tax on that appreciation: $0 (held by PIF; no owner; no sale)
```

## 11. DEMPE Compliance: Making It Bulletproof {#11-dempe-compliance}

### 11.1 What DEMPE Means

The OECD's BEPS framework (Action 8-10) requires that profits from IP be allocated to the entity that performs the **DEMPE functions**:

| Function | What It Means | Who Must Do It |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **D**evelopment | Creating, designing, engineering the IP | IPCo's engineering team |
| **E**nhancement | Improving, updating, iterating the IP | IPCo's engineering team |
| **M**aintenance | Keeping the IP functional and current | IPCo's ops/engineering team |
| **P**rotection | Patents, trade secrets, NDAs, enforcement | IPCo's legal counsel |
| **E**xploitation | Licensing, commercializing, selling the IP | IPCo's business team |

**If the Mexican OpCo performs all DEMPE functions and IPCo is just a shell, any tax authority can reassign the IP profits back to Mexico.**

### 11.2 How to Build Real Substance

TE Technology Ltd (UK) must have genuine substance. This means:

**People (minimum viable substance at Year 1):**
- CTO / VP Engineering — UK-based, employed by TE Technology Ltd
- 1-2 senior engineers — UK-based or remote for UK entity
- Access to contracted development teams (managed by UK CTO)

**Decisions:**
- Technology roadmap decided in UK (board minutes, strategy documents)
- Architecture decisions made by UK-based CTO
- Feature prioritization done by UK team
- Budget allocation decisions made by UK entity
- Vendor selection and management by UK entity

**Assets:**
- UK registered office (serviced office acceptable initially; dedicated space better)
- UK bank account with operating funds
- IP registrations in name of UK entity
- Development infrastructure (cloud accounts, source code repos) owned by UK entity

**Documentation:**
- Board minutes showing technology decisions made in UK
- Employment contracts for UK-based personnel
- R&D contracts with development teams (signed by UK entity)
- Patent applications filed by UK entity
- Annual DEMPE assessment (internal memo confirming functions performed)

### 11.3 Scaling Substance With Revenue

| Year | Revenue to IPCo | UK Staff | UK Office | R&D Spend | DEMPE Coverage |
|------|----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | $500K-1M | 1-2 | Serviced office | $200K | CTO directs all development |
| 2 | $1-2M | 3-5 | Small dedicated office | $500K | Core team in UK |
| 3 | $2-4M | 5-10 | Proper office | $1M | Full R&D function in UK |
| 5 | $6-12M | 10-20 | R&D center | $2-4M | Complete substance |

The substance cost scales with revenue, ensuring the economic rationale always holds: you're spending money in the UK to justify earning IP income there.

## 12. Transfer Pricing Defense {#12-transfer-pricing-defense}

### 12.1 The Critical Intercompany Agreements

| Agreement | Parties | Payment | Method | Benchmark Rate |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Master Technology License** | TE Technology → TE Ops Mexico | Royalty (% of revenue) | CUT or TNMM | 3-5% (medical device/health tech comparables) |
| **SaaS Services Agreement** | TE Technology → TE Ops Mexico | Monthly subscription | Cost-plus or CUP | Market rate for comparable health-tech SaaS |
| **Data Processing Agreement** | TE Data Intel → TE Ops Mexico | Processing fee per record | Cost-plus | Cost + 10-15% markup |
| **Contract R&D Agreement** | TE Technology → Dev contractors | Cost + markup | Cost-plus | Cost + 10-15% (software development comparables) |
| **Brand License** | TE Brand → TE Ops Mexico | Royalty (% of revenue) | CUT or profit split | 2-3% (hospitality/wellness brand comparables) |

### 12.2 Defending the Royalty Rate

The most scrutinized number will be the royalty rate charged to Mexican OpCo. SAT will ask: "Is 5% reasonable for this IP?"

**Defense strategy:**

1. **Comparable transactions:** Medical device licensing typically commands 3-8% royalties. Health-tech SaaS licensing is 5-12%. A 5% blended rate is conservative.

2. **Profit split analysis:** What percentage of OpCo's revenue is attributable to the technology vs. local operations? If the AI platform drives 20-30% of the value proposition, a 5% royalty is well below the full value of the technology contribution.

3. **Independent valuation:** Commission an independent IP valuation at formation to establish the arm's-length value of the technology being licensed. Update annually.

4. **Comparable company analysis:** What do similar health-tech platforms charge for licensing? Document extensively.

5. **Keep it conservative:** Better to charge 5% and never be challenged than charge 10% and face a SAT audit. The money still flows to the low-tax entity either way — volume matters more than rate.

### 12.3 Documentation Requirements

For Mexico SAT compliance:

- **Transfer pricing study** (commissioned before Year 1 operations begin)
- **Annex 9 (DIM)** — Annual related-party transaction disclosure (May 15 deadline)
- **Local File** — If related-party transactions exceed ~$13M MXN
- **Master File** — If revenue exceeds threshold (unlikely at seed stage)
- **Intercompany agreements** — Executed, filed, followed as written
- **Contemporaneous documentation** — Prepared before filing, not after audit

## 15. Implementation Playbook {#15-implementation-playbook}

### Critical Path (Must Happen Before Any Code Is Written)

| # | Action | When | Why |
|---|--------|------|-----|
| 1 | **Form TE Technology Ltd in the UK** | BEFORE development starts | Entity must exist before IP creation |
| 2 | **Hire CTO / VP Engineering employed by UK entity** | BEFORE development starts | DEMPE substance from day one |
| 3 | **Open UK bank account for TE Technology** | At formation | Fund development from UK entity |
| 4 | **Draft contract R&D agreement template** | Before hiring any developers | All work-for-hire must be for UK entity |
| 5 | **File patent applications** (provisional) for novel methods | As soon as patentable inventions identified | Patent Box requires granted patents |
| 6 | **Register all trademarks** in name of UK Brand entity | Immediately | Establish ownership chain |
| 7 | **Register copyrights** for all software in UK entity name | At creation | Establish ownership |
| 8 | **Execute IP assignment agreements** with all contributors | Before any work starts | Clean chain of title |

### Year 1 Buildout

| # | Action |
|---|--------|
| 9 | Execute Master Technology License Agreement (TE Technology → TE Ops Mexico) |
| 10 | Execute SaaS Services Agreement (cloud-delivered platform) |
| 11 | Execute Data Processing Agreement (TE Data Intelligence → TE Ops Mexico) |
| 12 | Commission transfer pricing benchmarking study for royalty rates |
| 13 | Establish source code repositories owned by UK entity (GitHub Enterprise / GitLab) |
| 14 | Establish cloud infrastructure accounts (AWS/GCP/Azure) in UK entity name |
| 15 | Begin contract R&D with development teams (under UK entity contracts) |
| 16 | File UK Patent Box election with HMRC |
| 17 | Apply for R&D tax credits in UK (additional benefit — credits for qualifying R&D spend) |

### Year 2-3 Optimization

| # | Action |
|---|--------|
| 18 | Hire additional UK-based engineers (scale substance) |
| 19 | File patent applications for AI methods, dosing algorithms, analytics |
| 20 | Launch data licensing program (pharma/research customers) |
| 21 | First full transfer pricing review and documentation |
| 22 | Evaluate Singapore IDI for non-Mexico licensing (if REFIPRE resolved) |
| 23 | Establish UK R&D center (if revenue justifies dedicated office) |

### Year 3-5 Expansion

| # | Action |
|---|--------|
| 24 | License platform to second TE location (new OpCo) |
| 25 | License to first third-party clinic (pure licensing revenue) |
| 26 | Scale data monetization (custom analytics for pharma) |
| 27 | Evaluate dual-jurisdiction IP strategy (UK for Mexico-facing, Singapore for Asia-facing) |

## 16. Open Questions for Counsel {#16-open-questions-for-counsel}

1. **SaaS characterization under Mexico-UK treaty:** Can cloud-delivered platform access fees be classified as "business profits" (Article 7, 0% WHT) rather than royalties (Article 12, 10% WHT) or technical services (25% WHT)?

2. **UK Patent Box eligibility for AI algorithms:** Can AI/ML treatment personalization algorithms and pharmacogenomic dosing models qualify for UK Patent Box via UK or EPO patent grants? What is the timeline for patent prosecution?

3. **Software copyright in UK Patent Box:** The UK Patent Box primarily covers patents. Can copyrighted software qualify, or only patented software? What is the distinction for clinical decision-support systems?

4. **DEMPE minimum viable substance:** What is the minimum UK presence (headcount, office, decision-making) that HMRC and SAT would accept for a Year 1 operation? Is 1 UK-based CTO directing offshore contract developers sufficient?

5. **Contract R&D work product ownership:** Under UK law, does a contract R&D agreement automatically vest IP ownership in the commissioning party (TE Technology Ltd), or are specific assignment clauses required?

6. **Data asset classification:** Under UK tax law, is an anonymized clinical dataset a "qualifying IP asset" for Patent Box purposes if the analytical methodology applied to it is patented?

7. **Singapore IDI as alternative:** If we hire developers in Singapore and apply for IDI at 5%, does Singapore's 17% headline rate trigger REFIPRE for royalty payments from Mexico to Singapore?

8. **UK R&D tax credits:** Can TE Technology Ltd claim UK R&D tax credits for development work performed by overseas contractors under contract R&D arrangements?

9. **Third-party licensing and transfer pricing:** When TE Technology licenses to unrelated third-party clinics, does the pricing of those arm's-length deals establish a benchmark for the related-party pricing to TE OpCos?

10. **Trademark licensing and IP Box:** Given that trademarks are excluded from most IP Box regimes, what is the most tax-efficient jurisdiction for brand licensing? Singapore (17%, no exclusion)? Or keep in UK at 25% for simplicity?

*This document represents an AI-assisted strategic analysis of technology IP offshoring structures. It does not constitute legal, tax, or financial advice. Tax authorities actively scrutinize IP holding structures, and improper implementation can result in transfer pricing adjustments, denied deductions, penalties, and reputational damage. Every element of this structure must be validated by qualified professionals before implementation. The OECD BEPS framework is evolving and rules may change.*
