# How We Raise the Money (No Seller Involved)

**3 ways to fund a ~$16M project. Same destination, different vehicles.**

---

## Option A: "The Rental Car"

**Preferred Equity + Mandatory Buyback**

Investors put up all the cash. They get paid back with interest. At Year 5, we buy them out. They leave. We own everything.

```
INVESTOR puts in $15-17M
   |
   v
Gets 9% annual return (like a bond)
   |
   v
Year 5: We pay them back in full
   |
   v
FOUNDERS own 100% of the real estate, free and clear
```

**What investors get:**
- 9% yearly return on real estate money (paid quarterly)
- 25% ownership in the operating business
- If we don't pay at Year 5, they can force a sale

**What we keep:**
- 100% of the real estate (always)
- 75% of the operating company
- Full control of everything

**The math:** Investor puts in $10M, gets back ~$12.7M over 5 years. We keep the property.

**Who likes this:** Family offices, people who want a predictable return backed by real estate. Think: "I want my money back plus profit, not a forever partnership."

## Option B: "The Mortgage"

**Secured Debt (We Borrow It)**

Same idea as a home mortgage. We borrow the money, pay interest, pay it back. Lenders have zero ownership. They're creditors, not partners.

```
LENDER gives us $10-12M
   |
   v
We pay 11% interest (like a private mortgage)
   |
   v
Year 5: Loan is fully repaid
   |
   v
FOUNDERS own 100% of everything. Lender walks away happy.
```

**What lenders get:**
- 11% annual interest (contractual, not dependent on performance)
- First claim on the property if we default
- Total payout: ~$14.5M on $11M lent

**What we keep:**
- 100% of the real estate (from Day 1)
- 70% of the operating company
- Full control, no board seats for lenders

**The math:** Borrow $11M. Pay back $14.5M over 5 years. Nobody owns a piece of our thing.

**Who likes this:** Private lenders, credit-focused investors. Think: "Just pay me my 11% and leave me alone."

## Option C: "The Test Drive"

**Real Estate Fund + Convertible Notes**

Institutional structure. Investors join a fund for the real estate. Operating company money comes in as convertible notes — basically IOUs that *might* turn into equity at Month 24, or we pay them back at 1.5x.

```
FUND INVESTORS put in $10-12M for real estate
   |
   v
They earn 8% preferred return + profit share above that

CONVERTIBLE NOTE HOLDERS put in $3-4M for operations
   |
   v
Month 24: Notes convert to ~25% equity OR we buy them back at 1.5x
```

**What investors get:**
- RE fund: 8% preferred return, then 80/20 profit split (we get the 20 as carried interest)
- Convertible notes: 8% interest accruing, then either equity at a $15M cap or 1.5x their money back
- Optional exit at Year 5

**What we keep:**
- GP control (we run the fund, make all decisions)
- 70%+ of the operating company after conversion
- 20% carried interest (our cut of fund profits above 8%)
- Management fees from Day 1 (~$165K/year)

**The math:** We put in zero cash. We run the fund. We earn fees. We keep the carry. After Year 5, we can buy everyone out.

**Who likes this:** PE firms, sophisticated family offices. Think: "I know how funds work. Show me the waterfall."

## Side by Side

| | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vibe** | Rental car | Mortgage | Test drive |
| **Cash needed** | $15-17M | $15-17M | $15-17M |
| **We own RE** | 100% (always) | 100% (always) | GP control (buy out LPs later) |
| **We own OpCo** | 75% | 70% | 70-80% |
| **Investor exit** | Year 5 buyback | Year 5 loan paid off | Year 5 optional redemption |
| **Investor risk** | Low (preferred + property lien) | Lowest (secured debt) | Medium (fund + conversion) |
| **Complexity** | Medium | Simple | High |
| **Best for** | Yield seekers | Lenders | PE/institutional |

**Bottom line:** All three roads end at the same place — we own the property, we control the business, investors get paid. The question is just *how* we structure the ride.
