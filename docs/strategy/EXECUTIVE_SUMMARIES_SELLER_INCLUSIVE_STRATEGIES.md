## Strategy 1: The Legacy Steward — Seller Carry + Legacy Equity

### How the Seller Is Integrated

The seller carries $7.5M of the $10.5M purchase price as a secured promissory note and retains a permanent 10% non-controlling stake in the real estate entity. He receives cash at close, predictable interest income, and long-term equity upside — while remaining emotionally connected to the property through an honorary "Legacy Steward" title, named recognition, and annual updates.

- **$3M cash at close** from investor capital
- **$7.5M seller note** at 7.5% interest, first-lien secured
- **10% non-controlling, non-voting equity** in the RE entity
- **No operational involvement** — connection without complication

---

### Financial Outcome for the Seller

| Component | Value | When |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Cash at close | $3,000,000 | Day 1 |
| Interest payments (Years 1–2) | $1,125,000 | Quarterly |
| Principal + interest (Years 3–5) | $7,800,000 | Monthly / balloon |
| 10% RE equity value (Year 5) | $2,500,000–$4,000,000 | Ongoing |
| **Total 5-year value** | **$14,425,000–$15,925,000** | |

**37–52% total return** on a $10.5M sale — significantly outperforming passive alternatives.

**Protections:** First-lien on property. Quarterly payments from Day 1. 90-day cure period with forced sale right. Annual independent appraisal. Tag-along rights on any RE entity sale.

---

### Founder & Project Benefits

- **Only $3M cash needed at close** — preserves maximum capital for buildout and operations
- **7.5% interest rate** is below private lending market rates (10–12% typical)
- **24-month interest-only period** matches operating ramp — no principal pressure during buildout
- **Seller's 10% is non-voting** — zero governance burden
- **First-lien attaches to property only** — IP, OpCo, and operating cash are untouched
- **Year 1 DSCR of 5.7x** — massive safety margin on debt service
- **Legacy framing reduces negotiation friction** — seller focuses on meaning, not price

---

### Investor Perspective

Seller financing removes $7.5M from the capital raise. Investors fund only the $3M cash-at-close plus operating capital — dramatically reducing the equity raise and concentrating investor capital where returns are highest (the operating business). The seller's first-lien is on property only, not on the operating company or IP. The seller's continued connection signals confidence in the asset.

---

### Legacy & Stewardship Framing

The seller didn't lose his property — he entrusted it to stewards who will elevate it. A physical plaque honors him as the original builder. Quarterly narrative letters describe lives being changed in rooms he designed. His 10% equity means he isn't a former owner — he is a current participant whose wealth grows as the property grows. His legacy compounds.

> "We don't want to buy your property. We want to become its next stewards."

---

### Why This Is a Win-Win

- **Seller:** Receives more total value ($14.4–15.9M) than a clean cash sale. Maintains permanent connection. Predictable secured income. Downside protection he understands (first-lien on a property he knows intimately).
- **Founders:** Lowest cash-at-close ($3M). Below-market interest rate. Full voting control. No operational interference. Optionality to buy out the 10% at FMV after Year 5.
- **Investors:** Smaller raise required. Capital concentrated in the high-return operating business. Seller financing de-risks the real estate layer. Seller's continued stake signals alignment.

---

## Strategy 2: The Evolution — Seller as the Bank + Profit Participation

### How the Seller Is Integrated

The seller carries the largest possible note ($8M on a $10M purchase) and receives zero equity in the real estate entity. Instead, he earns a profit participation right — 4% of annual EBITDA from the operating company — for 10 years, capped at $5M total. He is the banker whose building became a transformation center. His return scales with the project's success.

- **$2–2.5M cash at close** from investor capital
- **$8M seller note** at 8% interest, first-lien secured
- **4% EBITDA profit participation** for 10 years (capped at $5M)
- **No equity in any entity** — purely economic participation

---

### Financial Outcome for the Seller

| Component | Value | When |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Cash at close | $2,000,000–$2,500,000 | Day 1 |
| Note payments (5-year P+I) | ~$9,940,000 | Quarterly / monthly |
| Profit participation (10-year) | Up to $5,000,000 | Semi-annual |
| **Total lifetime value** | **$16,940,000–$17,440,000** | |

**69–74% total return** on a $10M sale over the instrument life — the highest cash return of the first two strategies.

**Protections:** First-lien on property. Income from Day 1. Semi-annual audited EBITDA reporting. $5M cap provides certainty on both sides. Forced sale right on default. Buy-out option at present value if seller wants early liquidity.

---

### Founder & Project Benefits

- **100% RE equity from Day 1** — no seller equity to manage, negotiate, or buy out
- **Profit participation is capped at $5M** — total cost is known and bounded
- **4% of EBITDA is manageable** — ~$436K in Year 2 on $10.9M EBITDA (4.0% of EBITDA)
- **Buy-out option** lets founders extinguish participation at any time at present value
- **No governance rights** for the seller — economic participation only
- **Lower cash at close** ($2–2.5M) preserves more capital for operations
- **"Builder's Return" framing** reduces price sensitivity — seller focuses on total value, not headline number

---

### Investor Perspective

The seller finances $8M of the acquisition, leaving investors to fund only the cash-at-close ($2–2.5M) plus operating capital. The profit participation is a known, capped obligation — investors can model it precisely. No seller equity means no additional governance complexity. The seller's willingness to carry the largest note signals confidence in the underlying asset. Clean structure, clean cap table.

---

### Legacy & Stewardship Framing

The seller's building isn't being demolished or rebranded — it's being elevated into a healing destination. His "Builder's Return" is a recognition that the physical structure he created generates ongoing value. Annual impact reports show him both the financial returns and the lives being changed. He can truthfully say: "I built that place. And I still earn from it."

> "You built the foundation. We're building the future on top of it. And as the future grows, so does your return."

---

### Why This Is a Win-Win

- **Seller:** Highest total cash return ($17.4M). Income grows with the project's success. No equity complexity or governance responsibilities. Clean and predictable.
- **Founders:** 100% RE equity. Capped, buyable profit participation. Lowest governance overhead of all seller strategies. No permanent equity given to seller.
- **Investors:** Smallest equity raise required. Known and bounded seller obligations. Clean cap table. Seller financing replaces the most expensive layer of the capital stack.

## Strategy 3: The Partnership of Purpose — Seller Roll-Over + Full Integration

### How the Seller Is Integrated

The seller carries a $6M note, reinvests $2M back into property renovations, and receives equity in both the real estate entity (8%) and the operating company (2.5%). He joins the advisory board as a paid member. This is the deepest integration — the seller becomes a partner in the project's future.

- **$2M cash at close** from investor capital
- **$6M seller note** at 7.0% interest (lowest rate — reflects equity alignment)
- **$2M roll-over** reinvested directly into renovations
- **8% non-controlling RE equity** + **2.5% non-controlling OpCo equity**
- **Paid advisory board seat** ($50K/year + annual retreat stay)

---

### Financial Outcome for the Seller

| Component | Value | When |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Cash at close | $2,000,000 | Day 1 |
| Note payments (5-year P+I) | $7,140,000 | Quarterly / monthly |
| Advisory compensation | $250,000 | Quarterly (5 years) |
| 8% RE equity value (Year 5) | $2,000,000–$3,200,000 | Ongoing |
| 2.5% OpCo equity value (Year 5) | $3,675,000 | Ongoing |
| **Total 5-year value** | **$15,065,000–$16,265,000** | |
| **Including equity at fair value** | **$16,065,000–$19,940,000+** | |

**Highest total potential return** of all three strategies — driven by equity upside in a $147M enterprise. The seller's 2.5% OpCo stake alone could be worth $3.7M at Year 5.

**Protections:** First-lien on property. Equity upside in both vehicles. Renovation reinvestment directly enhances his own equity value. Advisory income floor. Tag-along on both equity positions. Buy-out at FMV after Year 5.

---

### Founder & Project Benefits

- **Smallest seller note** ($6M vs. $7.5–8M in other strategies) — lowest debt service obligation
- **$2M renovation reinvestment** directly reduces capital needed from outside investors
- **7.0% interest rate** — lowest of all strategies, reflecting seller's equity alignment
- **2.5% OpCo dilution is minimal** on a $147M projected enterprise
- **Advisory fee ($50K/year) is negligible** — and the seller's network could generate referrals worth multiples
- **Seller becomes the project's most authentic external champion** — an equity-holding, board-sitting, annually-visiting advocate

---

### Investor Perspective

A seller who reinvests $2M into renovations is the strongest possible signal of asset quality. His continued equity stake in both the RE entity and the operating company means his incentives are permanently aligned with all stakeholders. Investors benefit from reduced capital requirements (seller's roll-over covers $2M of renovation costs) and a cleaner negotiation (a seller who becomes a partner doesn't fight on price). The advisory relationship provides continuity and institutional knowledge about the property.

---

### Legacy & Stewardship Framing

This is the deepest emotional structure. The seller has equity in both the land and the healing center. His wealth grows as lives are changed. His advisory role gives him purpose — quarterly calls, annual visits, a real title. His $2M reinvestment is powerful symbolism: he is not walking away, he is upgrading. The "Founding Steward" title is permanent. His name is on the wall. He returns to his property as an honored guest, not a former owner.

> "You're not selling your property. You're joining a mission. You built the body. We're bringing it to life."

---

### Why This Is a Win-Win

- **Seller:** Highest potential total return ($16–20M+). Deepest personal connection. Real purpose and engagement. Equity upside in a $147M enterprise. His divorce narrative shifts from loss to evolution.
- **Founders:** Smallest debt obligation. $2M renovation capital from seller. Lowest interest rate. Seller becomes an advocate, not an adversary. Reduced negotiation friction.
- **Investors:** Strongest seller alignment signal. Reduced capital requirements. Clean deal dynamics. Seller's continued involvement provides credibility and continuity with minimal governance cost.
