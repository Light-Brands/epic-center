## Zero-Tax Global Technology Structure

**Optimize for the Tech, Not for Any Single Location**

**Date:** February 2026
**Classification:** STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL - Founders Only
**Version:** 0.1 DRAFT - For Strategic Discussion
**Prepared by:** AI-Assisted Strategy Analysis

---

> **DISCLAIMER**: This document explores the most aggressive legal structuring approach — placing the technology entity in a zero or near-zero tax jurisdiction and accepting any local tax consequences. These strategies are used by multinational technology companies but carry elevated risk of challenge by local tax authorities. Every strategy must be validated by qualified international tax counsel, local counsel in each operating jurisdiction, and transfer pricing specialists. This is not legal or tax advice.

---

## TL;DR

**The premise:** Stop optimizing around Mexico's REFIPRE rules. Mexico is one location among many. Optimize the tech entity for global scale at the lowest possible rate. Keep every local OpCo at tight margins. Accept local consequences.

**The structure:**
- **Panama PIF** → personal ownership, 0% tax
- **TE Global Technology** in **UAE Free Zone (0%)** or **Singapore (0-5%)** → owns all IP, platform, clinical AI, brand, guest relationships. Collects all guest payments globally. Pays local OpCos a service delivery fee at cost + 8-12%.
- **Local OpCos** in every country → employ staff, operate facility, earn minimal margin, pay local tax on small profit only

**Why this works:** In the platform-as-principal model, guest payments flow TO the zero-tax entity. The local OpCo receives a service delivery fee FROM the tech entity. The local OpCo doesn't make deductible payments UP to a zero-tax jurisdiction — so REFIPRE and similar rules don't bite on the payment flow itself.

**The numbers (Year 5, Tulum only):**
- Total HC revenue: $35.5M → collected by UAE/SG entity
- Tech entity retains: ~$20.1M → **0% tax = $0**
- Mexico OpCo receives: ~$15.4M (costs + 10% margin)
- Mexico OpCo tax: ~$420K
- **Total tax: ~$420K** (effective **1.2%** of total revenue)
- vs. Netherlands model: ~$3.1M (15%)
- vs. All-in-Mexico: ~$6.2M (30%)
- **Annual savings vs. NL model: ~$2.7M**

**At 10 locations: $200K-$500K tax per location = $2-5M total** vs. $21-45M if all-local.

**The risks:** PE challenges (SAT could argue the tech entity has a permanent establishment in Mexico), substance requirements in UAE/Singapore, investor perception, OECD Pillar Two (irrelevant until EUR 750M+ revenue). This is the most aggressive approach. High reward, higher risk.

**Recommended jurisdiction: UAE Free Zone (Dubai Internet City or ADGM)** for 0% on qualifying income, or **Singapore with Pioneer Certificate** for 0% with better reputation.

## 1. The Shift: Why Ignore REFIPRE? {#1-the-shift}

### 1.1 The Insight

The previous five strategy documents spent significant effort working around Mexico's REFIPRE rules — the anti-avoidance provision that penalizes payments to jurisdictions with effective tax rates below 22.5%. This constraint forced the tech entity into the UK (25%) or Netherlands (25.8%), jurisdictions where the headline rate is high enough to avoid REFIPRE but IP box incentives reduce the effective rate to 9-10%.

The result: a blended effective rate of 13-20%. Meaningful savings, but still paying significant tax on the technology income.

**The user's insight is correct:** REFIPRE only matters if the Mexican OpCo is making deductible payments to the tech entity. In the platform-as-principal model, the flow goes the other way:

```
Guest → Tech Entity (0% jurisdiction) → pays down → Local OpCo

NOT:

Guest → Local OpCo → pays up → Tech Entity (0% jurisdiction)
                                 ↑ This triggers REFIPRE
```

If the tech entity collects the guest payment directly and pays the local OpCo a service delivery fee, the local OpCo isn't deducting payments to a preferential regime. It's receiving income.

### 1.2 When REFIPRE Could Still Matter

REFIPRE becomes relevant only if:

1. **The local OpCo pays royalties, licensing fees, or service charges TO the tech entity** — avoid this entirely in the platform-as-principal model
2. **SAT recharacterizes the arrangement** — arguing that the local OpCo is the real earner and should recognize full revenue, with the tech entity treated as receiving an intercompany charge
3. **SAT applies anti-avoidance rules beyond REFIPRE** — such as PE creation, beneficial ownership challenges, or substance-over-form arguments

### 1.3 The Trade-Off

| Approach | Tech Entity Rate | REFIPRE Risk | PE Risk | Investor Comfort | Annual Savings (Y5) |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Netherlands (Doc 5) | 9-16% blended | None | Low-Medium | High | ~$2.7M |
| **UAE Free Zone** | **0%** | **N/A (no upward payments)** | **Medium-High** | **Medium** | **~$5.8M** |
| **Singapore Pioneer** | **0%** | **N/A** | **Medium** | **High** | **~$5.8M** |
| **Singapore IDI** | **5%** | **N/A** | **Medium** | **High** | **~$4.8M** |
| **Hong Kong Patent Box** | **5%** | **N/A** | **Medium** | **High** | **~$4.8M** |

## 2. The Zero-Tax Jurisdictions: Full Comparison {#2-zero-tax-jurisdictions}

| Factor | UAE Free Zone | Singapore (Pioneer) | Singapore (IDI) | Hong Kong (Patent Box) | Bermuda | Cayman |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------|--------|
| **Effective tax rate** | **0%** | **0% (5-10 yrs)** | **5%** | **5%** | **0%** | **0%** |
| Rate after incentive expires | 9% (standard UAE) | 17% (standard SG) | 5-10% (renewal) | 16.5% (standard HK) | 0% (permanent) | 0% (permanent) |
| **Mexico treaty** | Yes (10% royalty WHT) | Yes (10% est.) | Yes | **No treaty** | No treaty | No treaty |
| **Global treaty network** | 100+ | 90+ | 90+ | 45+ | 0 | 0 |
| **Substance requirement** | Adequate employees + assets + OPEX in free zone | Significant — EDB approval, jobs commitment | Moderate — R&D team | Moderate — R&D nexus | Minimal | Minimal |
| **Tech talent pool** | Growing (Dubai) | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | None | None |
| **IP protection** | Moderate (improving) | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Limited | Limited |
| **OECD reputation** | Medium (improving post-2023 reforms) | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Low | Low |
| **Investor perception** | "Dubai tech" — mixed | "Singapore tech" — excellent | Excellent | Excellent | "Bermuda shell" — poor | "Cayman shell" — poor |
| **Personal tax** | 0% | 0-22% (progressive) | 0-22% | 0-17% | 0% | 0% |
| **R&D tax credit** | 30-50% (from 2026) | 250% enhanced deduction | 250% | 300% super deduction | None | None |
| **Copyrighted software qualifies** | Yes (if developed/managed in UAE) | Yes (IDI) | Yes (IDI) | Yes (Patent Box) | N/A | N/A |
| **Setup cost** | $15K-$50K | $20K-$50K | $20K-$50K | $10K-$30K | $15K-$30K | $10K-$25K |
| **Annual compliance** | $30K-$80K | $40K-$100K | $40K-$100K | $30K-$80K | $10K-$30K | $10K-$25K |
| **Annual substance** | $200K-$800K | $500K-$2M | $300K-$1M | $300K-$1M | $50K | $50K |
| **Best for** | Maximum tax savings; founder relocation | Best reputation + 0% rate; Asian expansion | Strong reputation + low rate | Asia-Pacific focus | Pure holding; no operations | Pure holding; no operations |

### 2.1 Immediate Eliminations

**Bermuda and Cayman** are eliminated for the operating tech entity. Reasons:
- Zero treaty network — every country charges maximum WHT on payments (25-35%)
- Zero tech talent — you'd be a shell company, which is exactly what tax authorities target
- Zero investor credibility — "our tech company is in Cayman" kills any institutional raise
- No substance story — nothing to tell a tax auditor

These can still serve as **holding layers** (Panama PIF → Bermuda/Cayman trust → operating entities), but the tech company that actually does things must be in a real jurisdiction.

**Hong Kong** is strong but has **no Mexico treaty** — a significant gap for your first and likely largest location. Without a treaty, Mexico charges 25-35% WHT on royalties/service fees (if any flow upward). Hong Kong is best as a **secondary hub for Asia-Pacific expansion** if TE opens locations in Thailand, Vietnam, or Japan.

### 2.2 The Real Contest: UAE vs. Singapore

The choice comes down to UAE Free Zone (0%) or Singapore (0-5%).

---

## 3. UAE Free Zone: The 0% Route {#3-uae-free-zone}

### 3.1 How It Works

Since June 2023, the UAE has a 9% corporate tax rate. **But Free Zone entities that qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP) pay 0% on qualifying income.** Non-qualifying income is taxed at 9%.

**Qualifying income for a tech/IP company includes:**
- Income from transactions with other Free Zone Persons
- Income from transactions with non-Free Zone Persons that is NOT excluded income
- Specifically: **royalties, licensing fees, and service income from outside the UAE** — this is the core of TE's tech revenue

**Excluded income (taxed at 9%):**
- Income from transactions with mainland UAE entities (not relevant for TE)
- Income from regulated financial services
- Income from immovable property in the UAE

**De minimis rule:** Non-qualifying revenue must stay below AED 5 million (~$1.36M) or 5% of total revenue, whichever is lower.

### 3.2 Best Free Zones for a Tech Company

| Free Zone | Location | Sector Focus | Notable Tenants | Best For |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Dubai Internet City (DIC)** | Dubai | Technology, software, IT services | Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, IBM | Tech platform companies |
| **ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market)** | Abu Dhabi | Financial services, fintech, tech | International financial firms | Fintech / regulated activities |
| **DIFC** | Dubai | Financial services, fintech | Bloomberg, HSBC, Visa | Financial tech |
| **Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC)** | Dubai | General trading, tech | 22,000+ companies | Broad flexibility |
| **Dubai Silicon Oasis (DSO)** | Dubai | Technology, R&D, manufacturing | Tech startups | R&D-focused companies |
| **Masdar City** | Abu Dhabi | Clean tech, sustainability | Siemens, IRENA | Sustainability-focused tech |

**Recommended: Dubai Internet City (DIC)** — purpose-built for technology companies, strong ecosystem, proximity to talent, recognized globally.

### 3.3 Substance Requirements

To maintain QFZP status and 0% tax:

| Requirement | What It Means | TE's Plan |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Core income-generating activities (CIGA) in the Free Zone** | The work that generates the income must happen in the UAE | Engineering team, product management, data science team based in DIC |
| **Adequate qualified employees** | Staff physically located in the Free Zone performing duties | 5-15 employees (CTO, engineers, product, data science) |
| **Adequate assets** | Tangible and intangible assets held by the entity | All IP, platform, servers (or cloud contracts) owned by UAE entity |
| **Adequate operating expenditure** | Spending that reflects the scale of operations | Office lease, salaries, cloud infrastructure, tools — $500K-$1.5M/yr |
| **Not elected out** | Haven't opted for standard 9% treatment | Default is QFZP; no election needed |

**The key word is "adequate" — proportional to income.** A $20M revenue tech company with 2 employees and a virtual office will fail. The same company with 10-15 engineers, a proper office, and $1M+ in operating costs is defensible.

### 3.4 UAE Personal Tax Advantage

The UAE has **zero personal income tax**. If the founder relocates to Dubai:
- No personal income tax on any source
- No capital gains tax
- No inheritance tax (in most structures)
- Combined with Panama PIF ownership: the founder pays **0% at both corporate and personal levels**

This is the "buy, borrow, die" strategy without needing to borrow — there's simply no tax.

### 3.5 UAE Treaty with Mexico

The Mexico-UAE Double Tax Treaty (in force since January 2015) provides:
- **Royalties WHT: 10%** (reduced from Mexico's domestic 25-35%)
- **Dividends WHT: 5%** (if >10% ownership) or 10% (otherwise)
- **Interest WHT: 4.9-10%**
- **Permanent establishment definition:** Standard OECD Article 5

However, this treaty matters only if there are payments FROM Mexico TO the UAE. In the platform-as-principal model, the flow is reversed — making the treaty primarily relevant for PE determination, not WHT.

---

## 4. Singapore: The 0-5% Route {#4-singapore}

### 4.1 How It Works

Singapore has a standard corporate tax rate of 17%, but offers several incentive programs that can reduce the effective rate to **0-5% for qualifying technology companies:**

**Pioneer Certificate (PC):**
- **0% tax** for up to 15 years (initial 5-10 years, renewable)
- Awarded by the Economic Development Board (EDB) for companies engaging in "pioneer" activities
- Healthcare technology, AI/ML platforms, and pharmacogenomics would likely qualify
- Requires commitment to create jobs, invest in Singapore, and contribute to the economy
- **Not automatic** — must apply and be approved by EDB

**Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI):**
- **5% or 10%** concessionary rate
- For companies expanding operations in Singapore
- Less restrictive than Pioneer Certificate
- Also awarded by EDB

**IP Development Incentive (IDI):**
- **5%, 10%, or 15%** concessionary rate on qualifying IP income
- Covers royalties from patents, copyrighted software
- Requires R&D performed in Singapore
- BEPS Action 5 compliant (nexus approach)
- **Can be stacked with Pioneer Certificate**

### 4.2 Why Singapore Has the Best Reputation

| Factor | Singapore | UAE |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Transparency International CPI | #3 globally | #24 (UAE) |
| Rule of law | Top 5 globally | Improving |
| IP protection | World-class (WIPO ranked #2 in Asia) | Developing |
| Tech ecosystem | Top 3 in Asia (alongside Tokyo, Seoul) | Growing rapidly |
| Investor perception | "Singapore tech company" = premium | "Dubai tech company" = some skepticism |
| OECD compliance | Full member equivalent | Recently joined BEPS inclusive framework |
| Banking | World-class (DBS, OCBC, UOB) | Strong (Emirates NBD, FAB) |
| Talent pool | Excellent (NUS, NTU, global talent) | Good and growing |
| English language | Official language | Widely spoken |

### 4.3 Singapore Substance Requirements

For Pioneer Certificate / DEI:

| Requirement | Typical Commitment | TE's Plan |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Headcount** | 10-50+ skilled employees | CTO + 8-15 engineers, data scientists, product managers |
| **Fixed investment** | SGD 5-20M ($3.5-14M) over incentive period | Cloud infrastructure, office, equipment |
| **Business spending** | Annual OPEX commitment | $1-3M/year |
| **R&D activity** | Must perform qualifying R&D in Singapore | Core platform development, clinical AI development |
| **Headquarters functions** | Strategic decisions made in Singapore | Board meetings, IP strategy, product roadmap |

### 4.4 The Singapore-Mexico Treaty

Mexico-Singapore DTA exists (signed 2010, protocol amendment). Treaty rates:
- **Royalties WHT: 10%** (estimated — standard treaty rate for Mexico's network)
- **PE definition:** Standard OECD Article 5

Same considerations as UAE — in the platform-as-principal model, the treaty is primarily relevant for PE analysis rather than WHT.

---

## 5. Hong Kong: The 5% Route {#5-hong-kong}

### 5.1 The Patent Box (Effective July 2024)

Hong Kong introduced its Patent Box regime on July 5, 2024:
- **5% tax rate** on qualifying IP income (reduced from 16.5%)
- Qualifying IP: patents, copyrighted software, plant variety rights
- BEPS Action 5 nexus approach applies
- R&D must be performed by the company (nexus fraction)
- **300% super deduction** on R&D expenditure (separate from Patent Box)

### 5.2 Why Hong Kong Is a Strong Contender

- **5% rate** on qualifying IP income — lower than Netherlands (9%), UK (10%)
- **Territorial tax system** — only HK-sourced income is taxed (offshore income exempt)
- **No capital gains tax, no dividend WHT, no royalty WHT outbound**
- **Excellent tech ecosystem** — Cyberport, Science Park, top universities
- **Gateway to Asia-Pacific** — ideal if TE expands to Thailand, Vietnam, Japan

### 5.3 Why Hong Kong Has a Gap

**No tax treaty with Mexico.** This means:
- Mexico charges domestic WHT rates on any payments from Mexico to Hong Kong (25-35%)
- No PE protection under treaty — Mexico applies its own broader PE rules
- Not ideal as the primary tech entity for the Tulum location

**Best use:** Secondary tech hub for Asia-Pacific expansion, or primary hub if Mexico is deprioritized relative to Asian locations.

## 6. The Money Flow: Why REFIPRE Doesn't Bite {#6-the-money-flow}

```

### 6.2 What This Means Per Guest

| Flow | Amount | From | To | Tax Impact |
|------|--------|------|-----|-----------|
| Guest payment | $37,800 | Guest (Toronto) | UAE Tech Entity | No tax (0% in UAE Free Zone) |
| Service delivery fee | $17,270 | UAE Tech Entity | Mexico OpCo | Income to Mexico OpCo |
| OpCo costs | $15,700 | Mexico OpCo | Staff, suppliers, facility | Deductible in Mexico |
| **OpCo profit** | **$1,570** | | | **30% tax = $471** |
| **Tech entity profit** | **$20,530** | | | **0% tax = $0** |
| **Total tax per guest** | | | | **$471** |

**Compare:**
- All-in-Mexico: ~$3,100 per guest in tax
- Netherlands model: ~$1,400 per guest in tax
- **UAE model: $471 per guest in tax**

### 6.3 No Intercompany Charges Upward

This is the essential design principle. The Mexican OpCo does NOT:
- Pay royalties to the UAE entity
- Pay SaaS fees to the UAE entity
- Pay brand licensing fees to the UAE entity
- Pay management fees to the UAE entity
- Pay any intercompany charge that creates a deduction in Mexico and income in the UAE

All of those "charges" are captured by the tech entity retaining a larger portion of the guest payment before paying the service delivery fee down to the OpCo.

**The tech entity's margin IS the implicit charge.** But it's not structured as a Mexican deductible payment — it's structured as the tech entity keeping its share of revenue it collected directly from the guest.

### 6.4 Where SAT Could Still Challenge

Even without REFIPRE, SAT has other tools:

| SAT Argument | Risk | Counter-Argument |
|---|---|---|
| "The UAE entity has a PE in Mexico through OpCo's activities" | **Medium-High** | OpCo acts in its own name, not as agent; no authority to conclude contracts for UAE entity; platform-as-principal model used by Uber/Airbnb |
| "The arrangement should be recharacterized — OpCo is the real service provider" | **Medium** | Guest contract is with UAE entity; payment to UAE entity; OpCo is a subcontractor providing physical delivery |
| "The service delivery fee is not arm's length — OpCo's margin is too low" | **Medium** | Cost-plus 10% is within range for limited-risk service providers; comparable to maquiladora margins |
| "General anti-avoidance rule" | **Low-Medium** | Mexico doesn't have a statutory GAAR (though courts have applied substance-over-form in limited cases) |
| "Transfer pricing adjustment under Art. 179-180" | **Medium** | Requires robust TP study showing the allocation reflects functions, assets, and risks |

| Mexico | 30% | ~$1.4M (Y5) | ~$420K | ~1.2% |
| Costa Rica | 30% | ~$1.0M | ~$300K | ~1.2% |
| Jamaica | 25% | ~$0.8M | ~$200K | ~1.0% |
| Portugal | 21% | ~$1.2M | ~$252K | ~0.8% |
| Thailand | 20% | ~$0.7M | ~$140K | ~0.7% |
| Spain | 25% | ~$1.1M | ~$275K | ~1.0% |
| Greece | 22% | ~$0.9M | ~$198K | ~0.8% |
| Colombia | 35% | ~$1.0M | ~$350K | ~1.4% |
| UAE (domestic) | 9% | ~$0.8M | ~$72K | ~0.3% |

**Average effective tax rate across locations: ~0.8-1.2% of total revenue** (just the local OpCo margin tax).

**Pros:** 0% tax. Period. Maximum cash retention. Founder can live in Dubai tax-free. Growing tech ecosystem.

**Cons:** UAE reputation is improving but still raises eyebrows with some institutional investors. QFZP rules are relatively new (2023) — less case law and precedent than Singapore. Substance enforcement standards are still evolving.

### 8.2 Option B: Singapore (Best Reputation + 0-5%)

```

**Pros:** World-class reputation. "Singapore tech company" carries weight with every investor class. Excellent IP protection. Pioneer Certificate gives true 0% for the critical first 5-10 years. After Pioneer, IDI at 5% is still outstanding. Best-in-class legal system.

**Cons:** Pioneer Certificate is not guaranteed — EDB must approve and requires significant job/investment commitments. Higher substance costs ($1.5-3M/yr). Personal tax is not zero (0-22% progressive) unless founder lives elsewhere and is non-resident.

### 8.3 Option C: Hybrid UAE + Singapore

```
UAE Tech Entity (0%)           Singapore Tech Entity (0-5%)
├── Guest payments (global)    ├── Clinical AI / pharmacogenomics
├── Platform / booking         ├── R&D headquarters
├── Workforce management       ├── Data analytics
├── Brand / trademarks         ├── Post-care subscriptions
└── Villa marketplace          └── Research licensing

Combined: 0-3% blended on all tech income
```

This adds complexity but hedges risk: if UAE's 0% regime changes or faces challenges, Singapore provides a credible fallback. Singapore's EDB approval also provides a government endorsement of the structure's legitimacy.

### 8.4 Recommendation

| If... | Choose... |
|-------|----------|
| Founder plans to relocate to a zero-tax jurisdiction | **UAE** (0% personal + 0% corporate) |
| Maximum investor credibility matters most | **Singapore** (Pioneer Certificate) |
| Hedging regulatory risk is priority | **UAE + Singapore hybrid** |
| Asian expansion is a near-term priority | **Singapore** (Asia-Pacific gateway) |
| Cost minimization is priority | **UAE** (lower substance costs than SG) |

**For TE specifically:** Singapore with Pioneer Certificate is the strongest overall choice. The pharmacogenomic AI platform, precision medicine technology, and healthcare innovation angle make a compelling EDB application. The 0% rate for the first 5-10 years captures the most critical growth period. After Pioneer expires, IDI at 5% is still excellent.

**If the founder plans to live in Dubai:** UAE is the obvious choice — 0% on everything, personal and corporate. The hybrid option (UAE for platform + Singapore for clinical AI) provides both the personal tax advantage and the institutional credibility.

### 9.4 Global Scale Scenario Matrix: 5 / 10 / 20 / 50 Locations

The following models assume each location reaches **steady-state maturity** (comparable to Tulum Year 5). In reality, locations ramp over 3-5 years — the early years will show lower revenue and savings. These projections represent the annual run-rate once all locations are operating at scale.

**Core Assumptions:**

| Assumption | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Average revenue per mature location | $30M | Tulum Y5 = $35.5M; smaller locations = $20-25M; blended average |
| Tech entity extraction rate | 43% | Matches EBITDA margin — tech entity retains what would have been operating profit |
| OpCo service delivery fee | 57% of revenue | Cost base + 10% margin |
| OpCo margin on costs | 10% | Arm's length for limited-risk service provider |
| Average OpCo cost base per location | $15.5M | Staff, facility, COGS, overhead at maturity |
| Average OpCo profit per location | $1.55M | 10% on $15.5M costs |
| Average local corporate tax rate | 25% | Blend: Mexico 30%, Jamaica 25%, Portugal 21%, Thailand 20%, etc. |
| Post-care subscribers per location | ~1,500 at maturity | Cumulative over 3-5 years |
| Post-care revenue per location | $3M/year | ~$2,000 avg annual subscription × 1,500 subs |
| Villa program | 50% of locations | Not all sites will have villa development |
| Villa commission per location (build phase) | $2.5M/year avg | 12% commission on $20M avg annual sales during build-out |
| Substance cost (tech entity) | Scales sublinearly | One engineering team serves all locations |

#### 9.4.4 Pillar Two Impact at 50 Locations

At 50 locations generating ~$1.7B in revenue, TE would exceed the OECD Pillar Two threshold of EUR 750M (~$800M). The Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules impose a **15% minimum effective tax rate** per jurisdiction.

**Impact on UAE (0%) at 50 locations:**

| Metric | Without Pillar Two | With Pillar Two |
|---|---|---|
| Tech entity income | $857.5M | $857.5M |
| Tech entity tax rate | 0% | **15%** (top-up applied) |
| Tech entity tax | $0 | **$128.63M** |
| OpCo tax | $19.38M | $19.38M |
| **Total tax** | **$19.38M** | **$148.00M** |
| **Effective rate** | 1.1% | **8.6%** |
| Substance SBIE offset | — | -$1.65M (5% of payroll + assets) |
| **Net tax after SBIE** | — | **~$146.35M** |
| **Savings vs. all-local** | $216.09M | **$89.12M** |

Even with Pillar Two at 50 locations, the structure saves **~$89M/year** vs. all-local — because the 15% floor is still substantially below the 25-30% local rates.

**Impact on Singapore (0%) at 50 locations:**

Identical to UAE — Pillar Two brings the effective rate to 15% regardless of the base jurisdiction.

**Key insight:** Pillar Two equalizes UAE and Singapore at the 50-location scale. The 0% advantage matters most during the **growth phase (1-30 locations)** before hitting the EUR 750M threshold. By the time Pillar Two applies, TE will have retained **hundreds of millions in tax savings** from the 0% years.

#### 9.4.5 Cumulative Tax Savings Over a 10-Year Growth Trajectory

Assume TE grows from 1 location to 20 locations over 10 years:

| Year | Locations | Revenue | UAE (0%) Total Tax | All-Local Tax | **Annual Savings** | **Cumulative Savings** |
|------|----------|---------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 1 | $10.7M | $0.17M | $1.20M | $1.03M | $1.03M |
| 2 | 2 | $41.0M | $0.62M | $4.50M | $3.88M | $4.91M |
| 3 | 3 | $82.0M | $1.16M | $9.00M | $7.84M | $12.75M |
| 4 | 5 | $125.0M | $1.62M | $13.75M | $12.13M | $24.88M |
| 5 | 7 | $185.0M | $2.33M | $20.35M | $18.02M | $42.90M |
| 6 | 9 | $250.0M | $3.10M | $27.50M | $24.40M | $67.30M |
| 7 | 12 | $330.0M | $4.03M | $36.30M | $32.27M | $99.57M |
| 8 | 15 | $420.0M | $5.04M | $46.20M | $41.16M | $140.73M |
| 9 | 18 | $510.0M | $6.05M | $56.10M | $50.05M | $190.78M |
| 10 | 20 | $600.0M | $7.75M | $66.00M | $58.25M | **$249.03M** |

**Cumulative 10-year tax savings: ~$249 million** (UAE 0% vs. all-local model)

Even against the Netherlands model (not just all-local):

| Year | Cumulative Savings vs. NL (15%) |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Year 3 | ~$6.4M |
| Year 5 | ~$21.4M |
| Year 7 | ~$49.8M |
| Year 10 | **~$124.5M** |

#### 9.4.6 What the Savings Buy

To put the cumulative savings in perspective:

| Savings Milestone | What It Funds |
|---|---|
| $5M (Year 2) | 1 additional TE location fully built |
| $25M (Year 4-5) | 2-3 additional locations + full R&D expansion |
| $50M (Year 6) | Entire Asian expansion (3-4 locations) |
| $100M (Year 7-8) | Full European expansion + villa development across portfolio |
| $249M (Year 10) | Equal to building ~15 new TE locations from scratch |

The tax savings fund the expansion that generates more tax savings — a **compounding cycle** where every dollar saved accelerates growth, which generates more revenue, which generates more savings.

#### 9.4.7 Summary: The Blended Effective Tax Rate at Every Scale

| Scale | UAE (0%) | SG Pioneer (0%) | SG IDI (5%) | NL (15%) | All-Local |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 location** | **1.6%** | **1.6%** | **5.1%** | **15.2%** | **30%** |
| **5 locations** | **1.1%** | **1.1%** | **3.6%** | **8.6%** | **13.8%** |
| **10 locations** | **1.1%** | **1.1%** | **3.6%** | **8.6%** | **13.8%** |
| **20 locations** | **1.1%** | **1.1%** | **3.6%** | **8.6%** | **13.8%** |
| **50 locations** | **1.1% ★** | **1.1% ★** | **3.6%** | **8.6%** | **13.8%** |
| **50 locations (Pillar Two)** | **8.6%** | **8.6%** | **4.8%** | **8.6%** | **13.8%** |

★ *Before Pillar Two — applies when group revenue exceeds EUR 750M.*

**The zero-tax structure delivers the lowest effective tax rate at every scale.** Even when Pillar Two applies at 50 locations, the structure matches the Netherlands model (8.6%) and remains substantially below all-local (13.8%). During the critical growth phase (1-30 locations), the 0% rate provides maximum cash retention for reinvestment.

## 10. PE Risk: The Main Threat {#10-pe-risk}

### 10.1 What Is PE Risk?

If a local tax authority determines that the tech entity has a **permanent establishment** in their country through the local OpCo's activities, they can tax the tech entity's attributable profit at the local rate. This would collapse the structure for that specific country.

### 10.2 PE Risk by Country

| Country | PE Risk Level | Why | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| **Mexico** | **Medium-High** | Aggressive SAT; BEPS Action 7 implemented; history of challenging commissionaire structures | OpCo must not conclude contracts on behalf of tech entity; tech entity has no fixed place of business in Mexico; robust legal separation |
| **Costa Rica** | **Low** | Territorial tax system — only taxes local income; limited PE enforcement | Standard precautions |
| **Jamaica** | **Low-Medium** | Limited tax authority resources | Standard precautions |
| **Portugal** | **Medium** | EU ATAD rules; competent tax authority | EU-compliant structure; genuine substance in UAE/SG |
| **Thailand** | **Low-Medium** | Treaty-based PE definition; less aggressive enforcement | Standard precautions |
| **Colombia** | **Medium-High** | Aggressive tax authority (DIAN); REFIPRE-equivalent rules | Similar challenges as Mexico |

### 10.3 How to Prevent PE Creation

The tech entity must NOT:
1. Have any employee permanently in the local country
2. Have a fixed place of business in the local country
3. Have the local OpCo conclude contracts on behalf of the tech entity
4. Have the local OpCo's management direct the tech entity's operations

The tech entity MUST:
1. Collect payments directly from guests (via Stripe/payment processor in UAE/SG)
2. Have guest contracts be between the guest and the tech entity
3. Make strategic decisions in UAE/SG (board meetings, pricing, product roadmap)
4. Maintain all IP, servers, and data outside the local country

### 10.4 The OECD 2025 PE Update

The November 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention clarifies PE rules for remote work but does not fundamentally change the platform-as-principal analysis. Key point: a home office does NOT create a PE if the individual works from that location for less than 50% of total working time. This supports having tech entity employees occasionally visit local sites for quality assurance without creating a PE.

---

## 11. Substance Requirements: What You Need on the Ground {#11-substance-requirements}

### 11.1 UAE (Dubai Internet City)

| Role | Count | Annual Cost (AED/USD) | Purpose |
|------|-------|----------------------|---------|
| CTO / VP Engineering | 1 | $250-400K | Technical leadership, IP direction |
| Senior Engineers | 3-5 | $150-250K each | Core platform development |
| Clinical AI / Data Science | 2-3 | $150-250K each | Pharmacogenomic engine, AI models |
| Product Manager | 1 | $120-180K | Product strategy, roadmap |
| Operations / Finance | 1-2 | $80-120K each | Entity management, compliance |
| **Total headcount** | **8-12** | | |
| **Total salary cost** | | **$1.2-2.5M/yr** | |
| Office (DIC) | | $50-100K/yr | Dedicated office space |
| Cloud infrastructure | | $100-300K/yr | AWS/Azure ME region |
| Legal / compliance | | $50-100K/yr | UAE corporate, international tax |
| **Total substance cost** | | **$1.4-3.0M/yr** | |

### 11.2 Singapore

Similar headcount but higher salary costs (Singapore tech salaries are 10-30% higher than Dubai for equivalent roles). Total substance: **$1.8-4.0M/yr**.

### 11.3 Substance vs. Savings

| Scale | Annual Substance Cost | Annual Tax Savings (vs. NL) | Net Benefit |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| 1 location (Y1) | $1.5M | $1.0M | -$500K (loss) |
| 1 location (Y3) | $1.8M | $2.5M | +$700K |
| 1 location (Y5) | $2.0M | $2.6M | +$600K |
| 3 locations | $2.2M | $6.0M | +$3.8M |
| 5 locations | $2.5M | $12.0M | +$9.5M |
| 10 locations | $3.0M | $23.0M | +$20.0M |

**The zero-tax structure breaks even at approximately 2-3 locations** compared to the Netherlands model. At 5+ locations, the savings are overwhelming.

**Important:** At a single location in Year 1, the UAE/Singapore model may cost more in substance than it saves in tax. The structure is designed for scale. If TE will definitely expand globally, implement early. If expansion is uncertain, the Netherlands model (Doc 5) is safer for a single location.

## 12. Investor Perception: Addressing the Optics {#12-investor-perception}

### 12.1 The Concern

Some investors, particularly US institutional funds, may have concerns about a tech company domiciled in the UAE:
- "Is this a real company or a tax shell?"
- "What about regulatory risk?"
- "Will our LPs have issues with a UAE structure?"

### 12.2 The Counter-Arguments

1. **Uber was in Bermuda.** Airbnb was in Ireland. Google was in Bermuda through the Netherlands. Apple was in Ireland. The world's most successful tech companies use aggressive tax structures. Investors care about returns, not about where the holding company sits.

2. **UAE is mainstream now.** Dubai Internet City hosts Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, Oracle, SAP, Amazon. It's not an offshore haven — it's a technology hub.

3. **Singapore is above reproach.** If investor perception is the primary concern, Singapore eliminates it entirely. "Our technology headquarters is in Singapore" is a premium positioning statement.

4. **The substance is real.** This isn't a PO box in the Cayman Islands. TE will have 10-15 engineers, a CTO, and a real office in Dubai or Singapore. The company develops real technology that serves real patients.

5. **Investors benefit directly.** Lower corporate tax = higher retained earnings = higher enterprise value = better returns. The structure aligns investor interests.

### 12.3 For the Seed Round / Series A

**At the seed stage**, keep it simple. Investors will be focused on the product, team, and market. The corporate structure should be clean and explainable in one sentence:

- "Our technology company is in Singapore, where we have our engineering team. Our operating companies are local entities in each market."

This is normal. It's how Grab, Sea Group, Razer, and most Singapore-based tech companies work.

---

## 13. OECD Pillar Two: The Future Constraint {#13-pillar-two}

### 13.1 What Is Pillar Two?

The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework's Pillar Two (Global Anti-Base Erosion rules, or GloBE) imposes a **15% minimum effective tax rate** on multinational groups with annual revenue above **EUR 750 million (~$800M)**.

### 13.2 Does It Apply to TE?

**Not for a very long time.** TE's projected Y5 revenue is ~$35.5M (single location) or ~$300M at 10 locations. The EUR 750M threshold is reached only if TE grows to 25+ locations or achieves significantly higher per-location revenue.

**Estimated timeline to EUR 750M threshold:** 15-20+ years at current growth projections.

### 13.3 What Happens When It Applies

If/when TE's global revenue exceeds EUR 750M:
- Any jurisdiction where the effective tax rate is below 15% will trigger a "top-up tax"
- The top-up tax is paid in the parent entity's jurisdiction (or allocated under GloBE rules)
- **The UAE 0% rate would increase to 15%** (through top-up)
- **The Singapore Pioneer 0% would increase to 15%** (through top-up)

**15% is still excellent** — it's what the Netherlands Innovation Box achieves today. By the time Pillar Two applies, TE will have benefited from 0% tax for 10-15+ years of the highest-growth period.

### 13.4 Planning for Pillar Two

The structure should be designed so that when Pillar Two eventually applies:
- The 15% floor is still the blended rate (not layered on top of other taxes)
- The substance in UAE/SG qualifies for the Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE)
- The SBIE allows 5% of tangible assets + 5% of payroll to be excluded from the GloBE computation
- A UAE entity with $3M in payroll + $2M in assets would exclude $250K from the GloBE base — meaningful but not transformative

## 14. Comparison: All Six Strategy Documents {#14-comparison}

| Doc | Structure | Tech Entity Rate | Blended Rate | 5-Year Tax (1 location) | Annual Tax at 10 Locations | Risk Level |
|-----|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **1. Corporate Structure** | Traditional holding | N/A | 25-32% | ~$14.4M | ~$45M | Low |
| **2. Global Tax Optimization** | Panama PIF + Treaty | Mixed | 15-20% | ~$8.8M | ~$27M | Medium |
| **3. Technology IP Offshore** | UK Patent Box | 10% | ~13% | ~$6.0M | ~$18M | Medium |
| **4. Platform-as-Principal** | UK at 10% (Patent Box) | 10% | 13-18% | ~$5.0M | ~$15M | Medium-High |
| **5. Total Tech Envelope** | NL Innovation Box | 9-16% | 13-16% | ~$8.8M | ~$18-23M | Medium |
| **6. Zero-Tax Global** (this doc) | **UAE 0% or SG 0-5%** | **0-5%** | **1.5-5%** | **$1.9-4.7M** | **$3.6-9.6M** | **Higher** |

**The zero-tax model saves $6-12M over 5 years at a single location** and **$20-40M annually at 10 locations** compared to the Netherlands model.

## 16. Open Questions for Counsel {#16-open-questions}

### For UAE / Singapore Counsel

1. **UAE:** Does a technology licensing company earning 100% of revenue from outside the UAE qualify as a QFZP in Dubai Internet City? Are there any excluded activity risks?

2. **Singapore:** What is the realistic timeline and probability of obtaining a Pioneer Certificate for a healthcare AI / pharmacogenomic technology company? What commitments (headcount, investment) would EDB require?

3. **Singapore:** Can the IDI incentive be combined with Pioneer — i.e., 0% under Pioneer, then transition to 5% under IDI?

4. **UAE:** What are the substance adequacy thresholds in practice? Is there a minimum employee count or OPEX for a company with $20M+ in revenue?

### For Mexican Counsel

5. **PE Analysis:** If a UAE/Singapore entity collects all guest payments and pays the Mexican OpCo a service delivery fee, does this create a PE in Mexico? What specific facts would SAT examine?

6. **Anti-avoidance:** Beyond REFIPRE, what tools does SAT have to challenge the platform-as-principal arrangement? Is there a general anti-avoidance rule? Relevant case law?

7. **Transfer pricing:** Is a cost-plus 8-12% margin defensible for a complex medical facility operating under the platform-as-principal model? What comparables would SAT use?

8. **Recharacterization risk:** Could SAT argue that the guest payment should be treated as Mexican-source income regardless of the contractual arrangement?

### For Transfer Pricing Firm

9. **Profit split analysis:** In a platform-as-principal model where the tech entity provides clinical protocols, AI, scheduling, and the local OpCo provides staff and facility — what is the defensible profit allocation?

10. **Comparable analysis:** What are the comparable margins for limited-risk healthcare service providers globally? Does the 8-12% range hold?

### Strategic

11. **Timing:** Should we implement the zero-tax structure from day one (seed stage), or start with a simpler structure and migrate later? What are the costs of migration?

12. **Dual jurisdiction:** Is there value in a UAE + Singapore hybrid, or does the added complexity outweigh the risk diversification?

13. **Exit planning:** How does the UAE/SG structure affect a potential acquisition or IPO? Would the tech entity need to be restructured?

*This document is version 0.1 DRAFT. This represents the most aggressive structuring approach in the strategy series. The potential tax savings are substantial ($12M+ over 5 years at a single location, $40M+ annually at scale) but carry elevated risks of PE challenge, recharacterization, and regulatory scrutiny. Every strategy must be validated by qualified counsel in each operating jurisdiction, transfer pricing specialists, and the chosen tech entity jurisdiction (UAE/Singapore) before implementation. This is not legal or tax advice.*
