### Transformational Epicenter Real Estate & Operating Platform — Mexico

**Date:** February 2026
**Classification:** Seller-Facing — Executive Summary
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents a clear, straightforward partnership structure for the acquisition and development of the Transformational Epicenter property in Mexico.

**The Core Proposition:**

Rather than a traditional sale, we are proposing a **partnership structure** where you retain 15% equity ownership in both the real estate and operating companies. This structure allows you to participate in the long-term value creation of what you built, while we invest the capital and operational expertise needed to realize its full potential.

**Your Position:**

- **15% ownership** in the Real Estate Company (land and asset value)
- **15% ownership** in the Operating Company (revenue and enterprise value)
- **Year 5 buyout option** providing liquidity and security
- **Legacy continuation** as a founding partner, not a former owner

**Our Investment:**

- **$5 million** operational buildout over the first phase
- Full capital deployment into infrastructure, team, systems, and programming
- Executive management and operational expertise
- Medical licensing, hospitality systems, and brand development

**The Outcome:**

Your 15% combined ownership is projected to be worth **$22 million at Year 5** — nearly double the current market value of the property — while maintaining a permanent connection to what you created.

## 1. The Two-Engine Structure

This partnership operates through **two separate companies**, each serving a distinct purpose:

### Engine 1: Real Estate Company

**What it owns:**
- The land (held via fideicomiso bank trust)
- All physical buildings and structures
- Future villa development program
- Hard asset appreciation

**What it does:**
- Owns and develops the real estate
- Captures property appreciation
- Builds long-term asset value

**Business model:** Asset value growth

### Engine 2: Operating Company

**What it runs:**
- The Transformational Epicenter medical and wellness operations
- Medical licensing and clinical programs
- Hospitality, brand, and guest experience
- Technology systems and AI platform
- Marketing and revenue generation

**What it does:**
- Operates the healing center
- Generates revenue and profit
- Builds enterprise value through operations

**Business model:** Revenue and EBITDA growth

---

### Why Two Separate Engines?

**Clarity:** Real estate value and operating value are fundamentally different. Separating them makes valuation transparent.

**Risk management:** Operating risk doesn't encumber the land. Real estate liabilities don't reach operating cash flow.

**Investor alignment:** Real estate investors care about asset appreciation. Operating investors care about revenue growth. This structure gives each what they need.

**Your benefit:** You own 15% of both engines. You benefit from property appreciation AND operational success.

---

### Visual Structure

```
REAL ESTATE COMPANY
├─ Owns: Land, buildings, villas
├─ Value Driver: Asset appreciation
├─ Your Stake: 15% non-voting equity
└─ Projected Year 5 Value: ~$35-40M
   └─ Your 15%: $5-6M

OPERATING COMPANY
├─ Runs: Medical center, hospitality, programs
├─ Value Driver: Revenue and enterprise value
├─ Your Stake: 15% non-voting equity
└─ Projected Year 5 Enterprise Value: ~$189M
   └─ Your 15%: $22M

COMBINED VALUE TO YOU: $27-28M at Year 5
```

## 2. The $5 Million Operational Investment

Here's what makes this partnership credible: **we are investing $5 million into operations** over the first phase to build the infrastructure necessary to hit the $22M Year 5 target.

### Where the $5M Goes

| Category | Investment | What It Builds |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Medical Equipment & Biohacking** | $1,000,000 | COFEPRIS-compliant medical systems, diagnostic equipment, ibogaine protocols |
| **Renovation & Conversion** | $1,000,000 | Converting existing structures into medical suites, therapy rooms, recovery spaces |
| **Technology Platform** | $750,000 | AI personalization, pharmacogenomic dosing, integrated guest management systems |
| **Working Capital** | $1,126,000 | Staffing, inventory, operating cash flow through ramp period |
| **Pre-Opening & Marketing** | $500,000 | Brand launch, medical licensing, initial guest acquisition |
| **Contingency Reserve** | $624,000 | Buffer for unforeseen costs during buildout |
| **TOTAL** | **$5,000,000** | |

### Why This Matters

**Without the $5M operational buildout, the $22M Year 5 valuation is not achievable.**

This is not a speculative projection. This is a capital commitment we are making to build the operating infrastructure that generates the enterprise value in which you will own 15%.

- **Medical licensing** requires specialized compliance, equipment, and protocols
- **Guest experience** requires hospitality systems, staff training, and brand development
- **Revenue generation** requires marketing, technology, and operational excellence
- **Enterprise valuation** requires all of the above operating at scale

**You are not betting on hope. You are partnering with operators who are putting $5M into making this real.**

## 3. Purchase Structure: $2M Down Scenario

Here is what the transaction looks like with **$2 million cash at closing:**

### Transaction Overview

| Component | Amount | Explanation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Purchase Price** | $10,000,000 | Negotiated acquisition price |
| **Cash at Close** | $2,000,000 | Paid at closing from investor capital |
| **Seller Financing** | $8,000,000 | Promissory note secured by the property |
| **Seller Equity (RE)** | 15% | Your ownership in Real Estate Company |
| **Seller Equity (OpCo)** | 15% | Your ownership in Operating Company |

---

### Seller Financing Terms

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Principal** | $8,000,000 |
| **Interest Rate** | 7.5% annual, fixed |
| **Payment Structure** | Interest-only for 24 months, then amortizing principal + interest over 36 months |
| **Security** | First-position lien on the property (you're first in line) |
| **Covenant** | Minimum 1.5x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) — operations must generate 1.5x the debt payment |
| **Prepayment** | No penalty after Month 12 |

---

### Cash Flow to You Over 5 Years

| Year | Payment Type | Annual Payment | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Year 1** | Interest only | $600,000 | $600,000 |
| **Year 2** | Interest only | $600,000 | $1,200,000 |
| **Year 3** | Principal + Interest | $2,200,000 | $3,400,000 |
| **Year 4** | Principal + Interest | $2,200,000 | $5,600,000 |
| **Year 5** | Balloon (remaining) | $4,400,000 | $10,000,000 |

**Total Note Payments (P+I): $10,000,000 over 5 years**

---

### Debt Service Coverage: Can This Be Paid?

**Yes. Comfortably.**

The operation generates substantial free cash flow from Year 1 onward:

| Year | Free Cash Flow | Annual Debt Service | Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) |
|------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Year 1 | $3,200,000 | $600,000 | **5.3x** |
| Year 2 | $5,360,000 | $600,000 | **8.9x** |
| Year 3 | $8,977,000 | $2,200,000 | **4.1x** |
| Year 4 | $11,270,000 | $2,200,000 | **5.1x** |
| Year 5 | $12,783,000 | $4,400,000 | **2.9x** |

**Your note is secured by operations generating 3-9x the required payment.**

Even in a downside scenario where revenue is 30% below projections, the DSCR remains above 2.0x in every year.

---

### Your Security Position

**First-lien mortgage on the property.**

If anything goes wrong, you have the right to foreclose and recover the property. You know this property better than anyone. You built it. You know its value.

This is not unsecured debt. This is real estate-backed financing where **you are the bank**.

---

## 4. Your 15% Equity Participation

### Why 15% in Both Companies?

**Real Estate upside:** The property will appreciate naturally (Tulum market growth 8-12% annually) and through active development (villa program, infrastructure improvements).

**Operational upside:** The operating company generates revenue and EBITDA, building enterprise value that compounds over time.

**Your 15% captures both.**

---

### What 15% Is Worth: Year by Year

#### Real Estate Company (15% ownership)

| Year | RE Company Value | Your 15% |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Year 1 | $12,000,000 | $1,800,000 |
| Year 2 | $16,000,000 | $2,400,000 |
| Year 3 | $22,000,000 | $3,300,000 |
| Year 4 | $28,000,000 | $4,200,000 |
| Year 5 | **$35,000,000** | **$5,250,000** |

*RE value driven by property appreciation, renovation improvements, and villa development program.*

---

#### Operating Company (15% ownership)

| Year | OpCo Enterprise Value | Your 15% |
|------|----------------------|----------|
| Year 1 | $29,000,000 | $4,350,000 |
| Year 2 | $55,000,000 | $8,250,000 |
| Year 3 | $87,000,000 | $13,050,000 |
| Year 4 | $110,000,000 | $16,500,000 |
| Year 5 | **$189,400,000** | **$22,050,000** |

*OpCo enterprise value driven by revenue, EBITDA, and enterprise valuation multiples (8-10x EBITDA).*

---

#### Combined Value

| Year | Combined Value of Your 15% Stakes |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| Year 1 | $6,150,000 |
| Year 2 | $10,650,000 |
| Year 3 | $16,350,000 |
| Year 4 | $20,700,000 |
| **Year 5** | **$27,300,000** |

**Your 15% combined ownership grows from $6M to $27M over 5 years.**

For the purpose of conservative financial modeling, we use $22M as the Year 5 target (OpCo equity alone). The real estate equity is additional upside.

---

### What "Non-Voting" Means

**You own 15%. You don't run the show.**

- **Non-voting equity** means you have no say in day-to-day operations, hiring, expansion decisions, or business strategy
- **You receive quarterly financial updates** showing performance
- **You receive distributions** when the company pays dividends (your 15% of whatever is distributed)
- **You participate in any sale or exit** (if we sell the operating company, you get 15% of the proceeds)

**Why non-voting?**

We need operational control to execute the vision. Investors (including you) participate economically, but founders retain decision-making authority.

This is standard in private equity and venture-backed companies. Equity ownership does not equal operational authority.

---

## 5. Year 5 Buyout Option (Seller Protection Mechanism)

**After Year 5, you have the option to request a buyout of your 15% ownership in both companies.**

This is a **protection mechanism** for you, not a forced exit. It gives you optionality and liquidity.

### Buyout Terms

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Trigger** | You may request buyout after Year 5 (not before) |
| **Price** | Fair Market Value (FMV) at time of buyout, determined by independent valuation |
| **Valuation Method** | Independent third-party appraisal OR agreed formula (trailing 12-month EBITDA x industry multiple) |
| **Payment Structure** | 50% cash at closing, 50% paid over 24-36 months with interest |
| **Interest on Deferred Payment** | 6% annual on the unpaid balance |
| **Your Right** | You can request the buyout. We cannot force you to sell. |

---

### Buyout Scenarios

**Scenario A: Year 5 Buyout (OpCo Only)**

If you request a buyout of your 15% Operating Company stake at Year 5:

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| OpCo Enterprise Value (Year 5) | $189,400,000 |
| Your 15% | $22,050,000 |
| **Cash at Buyout Close** | $11,025,000 |
| **Deferred Payment (24-36 months)** | $11,025,000 + 6% interest |
| **Total Buyout Value** | **$22,050,000+** |

---

**Scenario B: Year 5 Buyout (Both Companies)**

If you request a buyout of both your RE and OpCo stakes:

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| OpCo 15% | $22,050,000 |
| RE 15% | $5,250,000 |
| **Total** | **$27,300,000** |
| Cash at Close (50%) | $13,650,000 |
| Deferred (24-36 months + 6%) | $13,650,000+ |

---

### Why This Protects You

**Liquidity:** If you want cash at Year 5, you have the right to request it.

**Fair value:** You can't be squeezed below market value. Independent valuation ensures you're paid what your stake is actually worth.

**Optionality:** If the business is thriving and you want to stay in, you can. If you want to exit, you can.

**Security:** You're not locked into an illiquid asset forever. You have a built-in exit mechanism.

**No forced sale:** We cannot buy you out without your consent. This is your option, not ours.

---

## 6. Summary: What You Get

### Cash Payments Over 5 Years

| Component | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Cash at Close | $2,000,000 | Day 1 |
| Note Payments (P+I) | $10,000,000 | Quarterly/Monthly over 60 months |
| **Total Cash Received** | **$12,000,000** | |

---

### Equity Value at Year 5

| Component | Projected Value | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| 15% Operating Company | $22,050,000 | Based on $189M enterprise value at 8-10x EBITDA |
| 15% Real Estate Company | $5,250,000 | Based on property appreciation + villa development |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$27,300,000** | |

---

### Combined 5-Year Value

| | Amount |
|---|--------|
| Cash Received (Note + Closing) | $12,000,000 |
| Equity Value (Year 5) | $27,300,000 |
| **Total 5-Year Value** | **$39,300,000** |

Compare this to a traditional sale at $10M cash. You're receiving:
- **$2M more in cash payments** (debt service includes interest)
- **$27M in equity value** that continues to grow

**Your $10M property becomes $39M+ in total value over 5 years.**
