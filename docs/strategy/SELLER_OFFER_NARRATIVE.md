# An Invitation

**This isn't a term sheet. It's a conversation about what your property becomes, and who you become, if you say yes.**

---

## 1. You Built Something Extraordinary

You put $28 million and eight years of your life into this property. You poured craft into every detail. You built something that most people will never build in a lifetime.

The market doesn't see it. The market sees a listing price. A comparable. A spreadsheet.

We see a foundation. The first location of something that's going to change thousands of lives. And we see the person who made it possible: you.

---

## 2. The Problem With Selling

The market wants to hand you $11.9 million for a property you built with $28 million. That's a $16 million loss on paper, and something worse off paper. Because whoever buys it at $11.9M is going to flip it or gut it. Everything you built becomes someone else's margin.

You walk away with less than half of what you put in, and nothing to show for the years. No connection. No legacy. No story worth telling.

You told us you want more purpose. Selling doesn't give you that. Selling gives you a check and a loss.

---

## 3. The Offer

We're acquiring the property for **$11.9 million**, structured to give you both immediate liquidity and long-term enterprise upside:

**$2 million cash at closing.** Immediate liquidity. You walk away from the closing table with real money in hand.

**$9.9 million converted into equity ownership:**

- **15% equity in the Real Estate Company (TE RE Mexico)** — You participate in the appreciation of the physical asset, the property you built, as it transforms into a world-class healing center.
- **15% equity in the Operating Company (TE Ops Mexico)** — You participate in the operating growth of the business: revenue, profitability, and enterprise value as it scales.

**This is not seller financing. This is not structured debt. There is no interest owed on the $9.9 million.** The remaining balance is fully converted into equity ownership — a direct stake in two entities that are projected to generate significant enterprise value.

**A role and a title.** Founding Steward. $50,000/year advisory fee. Quarterly engagement. An annual retreat stay on the property you built. Your name on the wall. Permanently.

### Why Equity Conversion — Not Debt

This structure gives you something a traditional sale never could:

- **Immediate liquidity** — $2M cash at closing
- **Long-term enterprise upside** — participation in both asset appreciation (Real Estate Co) and operating growth (Operating Co)
- **No debt risk** — you're not waiting on payments; you own a piece of the enterprise
- **Alignment** — your success is directly tied to the success of what your property becomes

This is not deferred payment. This is not seller financing. This is ownership.

---

## 4. Two Companies, One Vision

Your equity spans two distinct entities, each with a clear purpose:

### The Real Estate Company (TE RE Mexico)
Owns the physical property. Manages the asset. Captures appreciation as the property transforms from a private estate into a premier medical wellness destination. Your 15% here means you participate in every dollar of asset value growth.

### The Operating Company (TE Ops Mexico)
Runs the business. Manages clinical operations, guest experiences, revenue, and growth. This is where the cash flow lives. Your 15% here means you participate in every dollar of operating profit and enterprise value creation.

**Why two entities?** Clean separation protects the asset from operational risk and gives each entity its own valuation trajectory. You benefit from both.

---

## 5. The $5 Million Operational Investment

We're committing **$5 million in operational capital** to launch and scale the business at your property. This covers:

- Medical buildout and clinical infrastructure
- Staff recruitment and training (clinical, hospitality, operations)
- Technology systems and guest experience platforms
- Marketing, brand launch, and initial guest acquisition
- Working capital through ramp-up to profitability

This is separate from the property acquisition. The $5M goes directly into the Operating Company to build a world-class operation on the foundation you created.

---

## 6. What Your Property Becomes

Your property doesn't get flipped. It doesn't become condos. It becomes the birthplace of a world-class healing center.

We're building a medical wellness destination: ibogaine-assisted therapy, advanced diagnostics, biohacking, and long-term recovery, all operating at the highest clinical standard. The kind of place people fly across the world to reach. The kind of place that changes the trajectory of someone's life in a single week.

This is the first location of a global movement. And it's built on land you created.

Every person who heals here. Every life that changes direction. Every family that gets someone back. It started with what you built.

---

## 7. What You Become

You're not a former owner who sold at a loss. You're a founding partner of a $147 million operation.

**Founding Steward.** A permanent title that recognizes your role in making this possible.

**Equity partner.** 15% of both the Real Estate Company and the Operating Company, growing every year as we scale.

**Advisory role.** $50,000 per year to show up to quarterly calls, share your insight, and stay connected to what's happening on your property.

**Annual retreat.** A complimentary stay every year at the healing center you helped launch.

**Name on the wall.** Permanently. Not a plaque that gets taken down when the next owner moves in. A permanent acknowledgment that this started with you.

You go from "the guy who lost money in a divorce" to "the founding partner of a global healing movement." That's not spin. That's what happens when you say yes.

---

## 8. The Numbers

Here's what the two paths look like side by side:

| | Sell for $11.9M | Equity Conversion Deal |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash at closing** | $11,900,000 | $2,000,000 |
| **Equity in Real Estate Co (Year 5)** | $0 | 15% ownership |
| **Equity in Operating Co (Year 5)** | $0 | 15% ownership |
| **Combined equity value (Year 5)** | $0 | $22,050,000 |
| **Advisory compensation** | $0 | $250,000 |
| **Total 5-year value** | **~$14,000,000** | **$24,300,000+** |
| **What happens to property** | Flipped by the next buyer | Healing center changing lives |
| **Your story** | "Sold at a 57% loss" | "I'm a founding partner" |

Your 15% equity, year by year (combined Real Estate Co + Operating Co):

| Year | Mexico Operation Value | Your 15% | What's Happening |
|------|----------------------|----------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $29,000,000 | $4,350,000 | Building + first guests |
| Year 2 | $55,000,000 | $8,250,000 | Ramping to capacity |
| Year 3 | $87,000,000 | $13,050,000 | Full operations |
| Year 4 | $110,000,000 | $16,500,000 | Brand established |
| Year 5 | $147,000,000 | **$22,050,000** | Mature operation |

Your $9.9M equity conversion becomes $22M+ in ownership value. That's a 122% return on the converted amount, plus $2M cash in hand from day one.

---

## 9. The $22M Year 5 Projection

The $147M combined enterprise value at Year 5 is built on:

- **Revenue ramp** from initial guest cohorts through full-capacity operations
- **Multiple revenue streams**: clinical programs, extended stays, training programs, licensing
- **Asset appreciation**: the property itself increases in value as a purpose-built medical wellness facility
- **Brand premium**: first-mover advantage in a rapidly growing market
- **Operating leverage**: fixed-cost infrastructure with scaling revenue

Your 15% of $147M = **$22,050,000**. This is the projected value of your combined equity in both entities at Year 5.

---

## 10. The Buyout

At Year 5, we have the option to buy back your equity at fair market value, structured over **24 to 36 months with interest on the buyout value**.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Price** | Fair Market Value at time of buyout |
| **How FMV is set** | Independent third-party valuation |
| **Earliest exercise** | Year 5 |
| **Payment timeline** | 24–36 months from exercise date |
| **Interest** | Interest accrues on unpaid buyout balance |
| **Notice** | 60 days written notice |

What that looks like in practice:
- **Year 5 FMV:** ~$22.05M for your combined 15%
- **Payment:** Structured over 24–36 months with interest
- **Result:** Full liquidity at fair value, on a defined schedule

You can't be squeezed below fair value. If we exercise the buyout, you get paid what your share is actually worth, with interest on the balance until fully paid.

---

## 11. Optional: Donation + Tax Credit Strategy

In addition to the equity conversion structure, you may have the option to donate a portion of your equity or a segment of the property's value into a qualifying charitable structure. This is an **optional scenario** — not mandatory — and could provide:

**Tax credit benefits.** Depending on how the donation is structured and your individual tax position, a charitable contribution of qualifying assets could generate meaningful tax credits or deductions.

**Strategic tax efficiency.** A well-structured donation, potentially into a 501(c)(3) or similar qualifying entity, can create tax savings that compound the financial value of this deal beyond the equity alone.

**Legacy positioning.** A charitable component adds a philanthropic dimension to your involvement — not just as a founding partner, but as someone who contributed to a mission-driven organization.

This option would be structured in consultation with qualified tax counsel and would not affect your core equity position or the terms of the acquisition. It is presented here as an available pathway for further optimization — one that aligns with the charitable and healing mission of the enterprise.

*Note: No heavy tax assumptions are made here. This scenario requires independent tax advice specific to your situation.*

---

## 12. Why Now

Your property is listed now. Every month it sits on the market, it loses leverage. The operation is ready to launch. We have the team, the medical protocols, the capital plan. What we need is the property. Your property. And the window to make this work at maximum value is 2026.

---

## 13. The Invitation

This isn't a negotiation. We're not trying to get your property for less than it's worth. We're offering you more than the market will: in cash, in equity, in purpose, and in legacy.

You built something extraordinary. The market wants to give you $12 million and forget your name. We want to give you $2 million in cash, $22 million in equity across two companies, a title, a role, and a story that matters.

Your property doesn't get torn down. It becomes a healing center. Your name doesn't get forgotten. It goes on the wall. You don't walk away with a loss. You walk away as a founding partner of something that outlives both of us.

> "You put $28 million and eight years into this property. The market wants to hand you $12 million and erase your name. We're offering you $2 million cash, 15% equity in two companies projected to be worth $22 million, and a legacy. Your property becomes the birthplace of a global healing movement. And you're not a former owner. You're a founding partner."

We're not asking you to sell. We're inviting you to be part of something worth building.
