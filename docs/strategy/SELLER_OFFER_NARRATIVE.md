# An Invitation

**This isn't a term sheet. It's a conversation about what your property becomes — and who you become — if you say yes.**

---

## 1. You Built Something Extraordinary

You put $28 million and eight years of your life into this property. You poured craft into every detail. You built something that most people will never build in a lifetime.

The market doesn't see it. The market sees a listing price. A comparable. A spreadsheet.

We see a foundation. The first location of something that's going to change thousands of lives. And we see the person who made it possible — you.

---

## 2. The Problem With Selling

The market wants to hand you $11.9 million for a property you built with $28 million. That's a $16 million loss on paper — and something worse off paper. Because whoever buys it at $11.9M is going to flip it or gut it. Everything you built becomes someone else's margin.

You walk away with less than half of what you put in, and nothing to show for the years. No connection. No legacy. No story worth telling.

You told us you want more purpose. Selling doesn't give you that. Selling gives you a check and a loss.

---

## 3. The Offer

Donate the property to a nonprofit aligned with our mission. In return, you get three things:

**A massive tax write-off.** Based on an independent appraisal of the property's fair market value — potentially $15-22M. Depending on your income, that saves you $2-9M in taxes over six years.

**15% of the Mexico operation.** You become an equity partner in everything we build at this location. Your 15% is projected to be worth $22 million in five years. Non-voting — we run the day-to-day — but every dollar the operation earns, you earn 15 cents of it.

**A role and a title.** Founding Steward. $50,000/year advisory fee. Quarterly engagement. An annual retreat stay on the property you built. Your name on the wall — permanently.

**Total value: $24-31 million.** Compared to $11.9M from a sale.

---

## 4. What Your Property Becomes

Your property doesn't get flipped. It doesn't become condos. It becomes the birthplace of a world-class healing center.

We're building a medical wellness destination — ibogaine-assisted therapy, advanced diagnostics, biohacking, and long-term recovery — all operating at the highest clinical standard. The kind of place people fly across the world to reach. The kind of place that changes the trajectory of someone's life in a single week.

This is the first location of a global movement. And it's built on land you created.

Every person who heals here. Every life that changes direction. Every family that gets someone back. It started with what you built.

---

## 5. What You Become

You're not a former owner who sold at a loss. You're a founding partner of a $147 million operation.

**Founding Steward** — a permanent title that recognizes your role in making this possible.

**Equity partner** — 15% of the Mexico operation, growing every year as we scale.

**Advisory role** — $50,000 per year to show up to quarterly calls, share your insight, and stay connected to what's happening on your property.

**Annual retreat** — a complimentary stay every year at the healing center you helped launch.

**Name on the wall** — permanently. Not a plaque that gets taken down when the next owner moves in. A permanent acknowledgment that this started with you.

You go from "the guy who lost money in a divorce" to "the founding partner of a global healing movement." That's not spin. That's what happens when you say yes.

## 6. The Numbers

Here's what the two paths look like side by side:

| | Sell for $11.9M | Donate + Equity |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash at closing** | $11,900,000 | $0 |
| **Tax savings** | ~$2,400,000 | $2,000,000 - $9,200,000 |
| **Equity value (Year 5)** | $0 | $22,050,000 |
| **Advisory compensation** | $0 | $250,000 |
| **Total 5-year value** | **~$14,000,000** | **$24,000,000 - $31,500,000** |
| **What happens to property** | Flipped by the next buyer | Healing center changing lives |
| **Your story** | "Sold at a 57% loss" | "I'm a founding partner" |

Your 15% equity, year by year:

| Year | Mexico Operation Value | Your 15% | What's Happening |
|------|----------------------|----------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $29,000,000 | $4,350,000 | Building + first guests |
| Year 2 | $55,000,000 | $8,250,000 | Ramping to capacity |
| Year 3 | $87,000,000 | $13,050,000 | Full operations |
| Year 4 | $110,000,000 | $16,500,000 | Brand established |
| Year 5 | $147,000,000 | **$22,050,000** | Mature operation |

Your $12M property becomes $22M+ in equity. That's an 83% return on market value — plus the tax savings on top.

---

## 7. The Tax Benefit

When you donate the property, you receive a charitable tax deduction based on an independent appraisal of its fair market value. The IRS doesn't care what you paid — they care what it's worth today.

**Your listing price** reflects a divorce fire sale — not true value. A proper appraisal, considering replacement cost, income potential, and comparable properties, could land at $15-22M.

**How the deduction works:** You can deduct up to 30% of your annual income each year. Whatever you can't use carries forward for five more years — six years total.

**If your income is high**, you could save $7-9M in taxes over those six years. Even if your income is modest, the equity alone makes the deal worth it — the tax savings are a bonus.

---

## 8. The Buyout

Your 15% isn't locked up forever. If we ever want to consolidate the operation to 100%, we buy you out at fair market value — determined by an independent valuation at the time.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Price** | Fair Market Value at time of buyout |
| **How FMV is set** | Independent third-party valuation |
| **Payment** | Cash |
| **Notice** | 60 days written notice |
| **Earliest** | After Year 1 |

What that looks like in practice:
- **Year 2:** Buyout at ~$8.25M
- **Year 3:** Buyout at ~$13.05M
- **Year 5:** Buyout at ~$22.05M

You can't be squeezed below fair value. If we buy you out, you get paid what your share is actually worth — in cash.

---

## 9. Why Now

Tax law changes are coming. The current charitable deduction rules — the ones that make this deal so powerful — are under active legislative review. The window to lock in a deduction of this size may not be open much longer.

Your property is listed now. Every month it sits on the market, it loses leverage. Take it off the market, get a proper appraisal, and make this move while the tax environment still favors it.

The operation is ready to launch. We have the team, the medical protocols, the capital plan. What we need is the property. Your property. And the window to make this work at maximum value is 2026.

---

## 10. The Invitation

This isn't a negotiation. We're not trying to get your property for less than it's worth. We're offering you more than the market will — in equity, in tax savings, in purpose, and in legacy.

You built something extraordinary. The market wants to give you $12 million and forget your name. We want to give you $22 million in equity, a multi-million dollar tax benefit, a title, a role, and a story that matters.

Your property doesn't get torn down. It becomes a healing center. Your name doesn't get forgotten. It goes on the wall. You don't walk away with a loss. You walk away as a founding partner of something that outlives both of us.

> "You put $28 million and eight years into this property. The market wants to hand you $12 million and erase your name. We're offering you $22 million in equity, millions in tax savings, and a legacy — your property becomes the birthplace of a global healing movement. And you're not a former owner. You're a founding partner."

We're not asking you to sell. We're inviting you to be part of something worth building.
