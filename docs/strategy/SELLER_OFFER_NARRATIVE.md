# An Invitation

**This isn't a term sheet. It's a conversation about what your property becomes, and what we all become, if you say yes.**

---

## 1. You Built Something Extraordinary

You put $30 million and eight years of your life into this property. You poured craft into every detail. You built something that most people will never build in a lifetime.

The market doesn't see it. The market sees a listing price. A comparable. A spreadsheet.

We see a foundation. The first location of something that's going to change thousands of lives. And we see the person who made it possible: you.

---

## 2. The Offer

We're acquiring the property for **$11.9 million**, structured to give you both immediate liquidity and long-term enterprise upside:

**$2 million cash at closing.** Immediate liquidity. You walk away from the closing table with real money in hand.

**$9.9 million converted into equity ownership:**

- **12% equity in the Mexican Real Estate Company** — the entity that owns and develops the property. You participate in the appreciation of the physical asset as it transforms into a world-class healing center.
- **12% equity in the Mexican Operating Company** — the entity that runs the Transformational Epicenter platform, inclusive of property management, real estate development, technology infrastructure, digital platform, and E-link center. You participate in the operating growth of the full enterprise: revenue, profitability, and enterprise value as it scales.

**This is not seller financing. This is not structured debt. This is not interest-bearing. There is no interest owed on the $9.9 million.** The remaining balance is fully converted into equity ownership — a direct stake in two entities that are projected to generate significant enterprise value.

This is an **equity-based partnership structure**. The $9.9 million is effectively reinvested by the seller into the project as equity participation.

### Why Equity Conversion — Not Debt

This structure gives you something a traditional sale never could:

- **Immediate liquidity** — $2M cash at closing
- **Long-term enterprise upside** — participation in both asset appreciation (Mexican Real Estate Company) and operating growth across the full platform (Mexican Operating Company)
- **No debt risk** — you're not waiting on payments; you own a piece of the enterprise
- **Alignment** — your success is directly tied to the success of what your property becomes

This is not deferred payment. This is not seller financing. This is ownership.

---

## 3. Property Security

Under this structure, you maintain **full lien security on the property** during the agreed structure period. This ensures alignment between both parties and provides downside protection for your position.

Your interest in the property is secured until the equity structure is fully in place and the partnership terms are satisfied. This is not a handshake — it is a contractually protected arrangement.

---

## 4. Two Companies, One Vision

Your equity spans two distinct entities, each with a clear purpose:

### The Mexican Real Estate Company
Owns the physical property. Manages the asset. Captures appreciation as the property transforms from a private estate into a premier medical wellness destination. Your 12% here means you participate in every dollar of asset value growth.

### The Mexican Operating Company
Runs the full Transformational Epicenter platform:

- **Property management** — ongoing stewardship and enhancement of the physical asset
- **Real estate development** — expansion, buildout, and capital improvement
- **Technology infrastructure** — systems, integrations, and operational technology
- **Digital platform** — guest-facing technology, booking, experience management
- **E-link center** — the digital and operational hub connecting all platform elements

This is where the cash flow lives. Your 12% here means you participate in every dollar of operating profit and enterprise value creation across the entire platform.

**Why two entities?** Clean separation protects the asset from operational risk and gives each entity its own valuation trajectory. You benefit from both.

---

## 5. The $5 Million Operational Investment

We're committing **$5 million in operational capital** to launch and scale the business at your property. This covers:

- Clinical infrastructure
- Team recruitment and training
- Systems and operational technology
- Brand development and launch
- Programming and guest experience design
- Sales engine and guest acquisition
- Technology and digital integration

This is separate from the property acquisition. The $5M goes directly into the Mexican Operating Company to build a world-class operation on the foundation you created.

**Without this $5M deployment, the projected valuation trajectory is not achievable.** This operational investment is what transforms a property into a platform — and a platform into a $194.9 million enterprise.

---

## 6. What Your Property Becomes

Your property doesn't get flipped. It doesn't become condos. It becomes the birthplace of a world-class healing center and integrated technology platform.

We're building a medical wellness destination: ibogaine-assisted therapy, advanced diagnostics, biohacking, and long-term recovery, all operating at the highest clinical standard — powered by a fully integrated digital platform, E-link center, and technology infrastructure. The kind of place people fly across the world to reach. The kind of place that changes the trajectory of someone's life in a single week.

This is the first location of a global movement. And it's built on land you created.

Every person who heals here. Every life that changes direction. Every family that gets someone back. It started with what you built.

---

## 7. What You Become

You're not a former owner who sold at market price. You're a founding partner of a $194.9 million operation.

**Founding Steward.** A permanent title that recognizes your role in making this possible.

**Equity partner.** 12% of both the Mexican Real Estate Company and the Mexican Operating Company, growing every year as we scale.

**Annual retreat.** A complimentary stay every year at the healing center you helped launch.

**Name on the wall.** Permanently. Not a plaque that gets taken down when the next owner moves in. A permanent acknowledgment that this started with you.

You go from a property sale to a founding partnership in a global healing movement. That's what happens when you say yes.

---

## 8. The Numbers

Here's what the two paths look like side by side:

| | Sell for $11.9M | Equity Conversion Partnership |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash at closing** | $11,900,000 | $2,000,000 |
| **Equity in Mexican Real Estate Co (Year 5)** | $0 | 12% ownership |
| **Equity in Mexican Operating Co (Year 5)** | $0 | 12% ownership |
| **Combined equity value (Year 5)** | $0 | $23,388,000 (projected) |
| **Total 5-year value** | **~$11,900,000** | **$25,388,000+** |
| **Minimum protected outcome** | N/A | $15,860,000 |
| **What happens to property** | Flipped by the next buyer | Healing center + technology platform |
| **Your role** | Former owner | Founding partner |

Your 12% equity, year by year (combined Mexican Real Estate Co + Mexican Operating Co):

| Year | Combined Enterprise Value | Your 12% | What's Happening |
|------|----------------------|----------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $32,000,000 | $3,840,000 | Building + first guests |
| Year 2 | $62,000,000 | $7,440,000 | Ramping to capacity + digital platform |
| Year 3 | $98,000,000 | $11,760,000 | Full operations + technology platform launch |
| Year 4 | $142,000,000 | $17,040,000 | Brand established + E-link center scaling |
| Year 5 | $194,900,000 | **$23,388,000** | Mature operation + fully integrated platform |

You receive $2M cash immediately. Your $9.9M equity conversion is projected to reach $23.4M+ in ownership value by Year 5 — a 136% return on the converted amount.

*All projections are estimates based on the current operating model and are subject to change.*

---

## 9. The $23.4M Year 5 Projection

The **$194.9M combined enterprise value** at Year 5 reflects the fully integrated Transformational Epicenter platform:

- **Revenue ramp** from initial guest cohorts through full-capacity operations
- **Multiple revenue streams**: clinical programs, extended stays, training programs, licensing
- **Property management and real estate development** — ongoing asset enhancement and expansion
- **Technology infrastructure** — proprietary systems driving operational efficiency
- **Digital platform** — guest-facing technology, booking, and experience management at scale
- **E-link center** — the operational and digital hub connecting all platform elements
- **Asset appreciation**: the property itself increases in value as a purpose-built medical wellness facility
- **Brand premium**: first-mover advantage in a rapidly growing market
- **Operating leverage**: fixed-cost infrastructure with scaling revenue

Your 12% of $194.9M = **$23,388,000** *(projected)*. This is the projected value of your combined equity in both entities at Year 5.

---

## 10. Five-Year Partnership Window & Buyout

The 12% ownership in both the Mexican Real Estate Company and the Mexican Operating Company is structured around a **five-year value creation period**.

After Year 5, **either party** may initiate a buyout:

- **You have the right** to request a buyout of your 12% ownership in both companies at fair market value.
- **We have the right** to initiate a buyout of your 12% ownership in both companies at fair market value.

This is a balanced, mutual mechanism — both sides have the ability to trigger liquidity when the time is right.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Who can trigger** | Either party (seller or founders) |
| **Earliest exercise** | Year 5 |
| **Price** | Fair Market Value at time of buyout |
| **How FMV is determined** | Independent third-party valuation, or pre-agreed EBITDA multiple methodology |
| **Payment timeline** | 24–36 months from exercise date |
| **Interest** | Interest accrues on the buyout valuation amount |
| **Notice** | 60 days written notice |

What that looks like in practice:
- **Year 5 FMV:** ~$23.39M for your combined 12% *(projected)*
- **Payment:** Structured over 24–36 months with interest
- **Result:** Full liquidity at fair value, on a defined schedule

You can't be squeezed below fair value. If a buyout is exercised, you get paid what your share is actually worth, with interest on the balance until fully paid.

---

## 11. Minimum Value Protection Guarantee

All enterprise values, including the projected $194.9M valuation, are projections based on operating assumptions. To provide downside protection and confidence in this structure, the agreement includes a **negotiated minimum buyout floor**.

### How It Works

The seller will not receive less than:

- The original **$11.9 million** valuation basis he is asking for
- Plus **8% annual interest** applied to the $9.9 million equity reinvestment portion

The 8% applies only to the $9.9M equity portion — not the $2M cash paid at closing.

### Five-Year Calculation

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Equity reinvestment amount | $9,900,000 |
| Annual interest (8%) | $792,000 per year |
| Interest over five years | $3,960,000 |
| **Minimum protected equity value at Year 5** | **$13,860,000** |
| Cash already received at closing | $2,000,000 |
| **Total minimum protected outcome** | **$15,860,000** |

### How Fair Market Value Interacts With the Floor

- If **fair market value at Year 5** (projected: $23,388,000 at 12%) **exceeds** the minimum floor → **fair market value applies**. The seller receives the higher amount.
- If **fair market value is lower** than the minimum floor → the **minimum buyout price becomes $13,860,000** for the 12% equity stake (plus the $2M already received at closing).

### What This Represents

- **Capital preservation** — the seller's reinvested equity is protected
- **Confidence-building mechanism** — the floor removes the fear of total downside
- **Downside protection** — even in a worst-case scenario, the outcome exceeds a straight sale
- **Alignment assurance** — both parties are incentivized to build value, with the seller's position secured

This is not a guaranteed return. It is a **negotiated minimum buyout floor**, subject to the definitive agreement between the parties.

## 12. Optional: Tax-Efficient Enhancement

The primary offer is the equity conversion partnership described above. It stands fully on its own merit.

In addition, if a **tax-efficient structure** can be legally implemented and is beneficial to you, we will collaborate to structure it accordingly. This could include donating a portion of equity or property value into a qualifying charitable structure.

**What this could provide, if applicable:**

- **Tax credit benefits** — Charitable contribution of qualifying assets could generate meaningful tax credits or deductions
- **Strategic tax efficiency** — A donation into a 501(c)(3) or similar qualifying entity could create additional tax savings
- **Legacy positioning** — Adds a philanthropic dimension to your involvement in the mission

**Important clarifications:**

- This option does NOT change the core equity conversion structure. The $2M cash, 12% + 12% equity, and buyout terms remain intact.
- If this pathway is not viable or not advantageous to you, the primary partnership structure stands entirely on its own.
- Tax implications are conditional and subject to independent professional verification.
- This is not presented as a tax write-off strategy. It is an optional enhancement, available only if it genuinely benefits you.

*This scenario requires independent tax advice specific to your situation.*

## 13. Why Now

Your property is listed now. The operation is ready to launch. We have the team, the medical protocols, the capital plan. What we need is the property — your property. And the window to make this work at maximum value is 2026.

---

## 14. The Invitation

This isn't a negotiation. We're not trying to get your property for less than it's worth. We're offering you more than the market will: in cash, in equity, in purpose, and in legacy.

You built something extraordinary. You invested $30 million and eight years. The market wants to hand you $12 million and move on. We want to give you $2 million in cash, 12% equity in two companies projected to be worth $23.4 million, a minimum protection floor that guarantees your outcome exceeds a straight sale, and a legacy that endures.

Your property doesn't get torn down. It becomes a healing center and technology platform. Your name doesn't get forgotten. It goes on the wall. You don't walk away with a transaction. You walk away as a founding partner of something that outlives both of us.

> "You invested $30 million and eight years into this property. The market wants to hand you $12 million. We're offering you $2 million cash, 12% equity in the Mexican Real Estate Company, 12% equity in the Mexican Operating Company — projected to be worth $23.4 million combined — with a minimum protection floor of $15.86 million. Your property becomes the birthplace of a global healing movement. And you're not a former owner. You're a founding partner."

We're not asking you to sell. We're inviting you to be part of something worth building.
