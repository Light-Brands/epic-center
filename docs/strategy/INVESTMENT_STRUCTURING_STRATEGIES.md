## 1. Architecture Foundation

All three investment strategies are built on the existing seven-entity global architecture spanning five jurisdictions. This section provides the structural context that underlies every strategy in this document.

### The Seven-Entity Ecosystem

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Role | Tax Rate |
|--------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Panama PIF** | Panama | Ultimate asset protection; holds 100% of Panamanian Holdings S.A. | 0% |
| **Panamanian Holdings S.A.** | Panama | Intermediate holdco; holds ~70% of TE Holdings + 100% of Studio + 100% of CI IBC | 0% (territorial) |
| **TE Wellness Holdings** | Cayman Islands | Owns all TE IP; collects all TE revenue; controls Mexico OpCo; investable vehicle | 0% (unconditional) |
| **Light Brands Studio FZ-LLC** | Dubai, UAE | Shared service center; builds for TE Holdings and Light Brands; employs team | 0% (QFZP) |
| **Light Brands Consulting Ltd** | Cook Islands | External consulting and SaaS; owns LB-specific IP; zero employees | 0% |
| **TE Ops Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.** | Tulum, Mexico | Operates healing facility; employs local staff; delivers guest experience | 30% on margin |
| **Church of the Living Light** | United States | Spiritual mission; dual royalty streams; employs founders as ministers | 0% (exempt) |

### Ownership Chain

```
Panama PIF (independent legal person)
  └── 100% → Panamanian Holdings S.A. (intermediate holdco)
                ├── ~70% → TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — investable vehicle
                │             └── 100% → TE Ops Mexico (operations)
                ├── 100% → Light Brands Studio (Dubai) — service center
                └── 100% → Light Brands Consulting (Cook Islands) — external revenue

Church of the Living Light — independent nonprofit, no owner
```

### The New Entity: TE Real Estate Holdings

Each strategy introduces a **dedicated real estate entity** to hold the Tulum property, structurally separating the real estate investment from the operating company investment. The legal form and jurisdiction of this entity vary by strategy, but in all cases:

- The property is held via a Mexican S.A. de C.V. subsidiary with a fideicomiso (bank trust) for restricted-zone compliance
- Real estate assets are isolated from operating company liabilities
- IP and brand value remain in TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman), outside the RE vehicle entirely

## 2. Base Assumptions

The following assumptions are shared across all three strategies and are derived from the financial model and negotiated acquisition terms.

### Capital Requirements

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Property Acquisition (negotiated) | ~$10,000,000 |
| Operating Capital (working capital, renovation, medical, technology, pre-opening, contingency) | ~$5,000,000–$6,800,000 |
| **Total Capital Raise** | **$15,000,000–$16,800,000** |

The acquisition price reflects an ongoing negotiation from the listed $11.9M to a target of ~$10M, creating immediate equity cushion for real estate investors.

### Revenue Projections (Base Case)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | 5-Year Total |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Total Revenue | $10,300,000 | $19,600,000 | $26,300,000 | $30,500,000 | $34,000,000 | $120,700,000 |
| EBITDA | $4,301,800 | $10,902,089 | $15,439,741 | $18,105,249 | $20,299,217 | $69,048,096 |
| EBITDA Margin | 42% | 56% | 59% | 59% | 60% | 57% |
| Net Income | $2,537,260 | $7,052,462 | $10,144,819 | $11,947,674 | $13,420,452 | $45,102,667 |

> **Source:** Financial model — Google Sheets `1Z0_N_V2gM-0rpW3IP9oRO12nmj51XwcTV_9R9fNsyWo`

### Key Operating Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 83% |
| Break-even Occupancy | ~3% |
| Average Revenue Per Guest | $26,600 |
| Year 5 Enterprise Value (base) | $81,200,000 |
| Project IRR with Exit (base) | 78% |
| 5-Year MOIC (base) | 7.5x |
| IP Value Estimate (Year 5) | $19–42M |
| 5-Year Cumulative Net Income | $45,102,667 |

### Non-Negotiable Control Requirements

| Vehicle | Minimum Founder Ownership |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Real Estate Entity | 51% (majority control) |
| Operating Company (TE Wellness Holdings) | 70% (supermajority control) |

These thresholds ensure founders retain full management authority over both real estate and operating decisions, consistent with the existing architecture where Panamanian Holdings S.A. holds ~70% of TE Wellness Holdings.

---

## 3. Strategy A: Parallel Equity

### Dual-Entity Direct Equity

**Character:** Clean, institutional, straightforward. Two separate equity raises in two separate vehicles, each with distinct risk/return profiles. The textbook private equity approach — familiar to family offices and institutional investors.

### Entity Structure

**TE Real Estate Holdings, LP** (Cayman or Delaware)
- Holds property via Mexican S.A. de C.V. + fideicomiso
- General Partner: Founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.)
- Limited Partners: Real estate investors

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- Owns all TE IP, collects all revenue, controls Mexico OpCo
- Founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.): 70%
- Investors: up to 30% preferred equity

### Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Total Capital | Founder Contribution | Investor Contribution |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| RE LP | $10,000,000 | $5,100,000 (51%) | $4,900,000 (49%) |
| OpCo (TE Holdings) | $5,000,000–$6,800,000 | $3,500,000–$4,760,000 (70%) | $1,500,000–$2,040,000 (30%) |
| **Total** | **$15,000,000–$16,800,000** | **$8,600,000–$9,860,000** | **$6,400,000–$6,940,000** |

### Investor Returns — Real Estate LP

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Preferred Return | 8–10% cumulative, compounding annually |
| Distribution Waterfall | 4-tier structure (see below) |
| Security | First-position mortgage/lien on $10M property |
| Forced Sale Rights | Available on default after 90-day cure period |
| Step-in Management | Triggered if DSCR falls below defined threshold |
| Reporting | Quarterly financials, annual audit, property valuation |

**Distribution Waterfall:**

| Tier | Distribution |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Return of Capital | 100% to LPs until invested capital returned |
| 2. Preferred Return | 100% to LPs until 8–10% cumulative pref satisfied |
| 3. GP Catch-up | 100% to GP until GP has received 20% of total distributions |
| 4. Residual Split | 51% GP / 49% LP |

### Investor Returns — OpCo (TE Holdings)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Preferred Return | 10–12% cumulative (higher risk premium for operating business) |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In all future equity rounds |
| Board Observer | One seat for lead investor or investor group |
| Tag-along Rights | On any founder share transfer |
| Information Rights | Monthly KPIs, quarterly financials, annual audit |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average, broad-based |

### Founder Control Mechanisms

- **GP of RE LP** with full management authority over property decisions
- **70% voting control** of TE Wellness Holdings
- **IP held in Holdings**, protected by the offshore structure — outside RE entity entirely
- Protective provisions require investor consent only for major structural changes (sale of entity, new debt above threshold, related-party transactions above threshold, changes to governing documents)

### Why This Strategy Is Attractive

**For RE investors:**
- Real asset backing — $10M property at negotiated acquisition price with immediate equity cushion
- Preferred return with hard collateral security
- Straightforward LP structure with institutional waterfall mechanics
- Independent from operating risk — property value persists regardless of business performance

**For OpCo investors:**
- Exposure to an 83% gross margin operating business
- Venture-style upside: 78% base-case IRR, 7.5x MOIC on total project
- Pro-rata rights protect against dilution in future rounds
- Clean Cayman structure familiar to institutional and family office investors

**For founders:**
- Two distinct investor bases that can be approached independently
- RE investors attracted to yield and collateral; OpCo investors attracted to growth
- IP and brand fully protected in Holdings — never collateralized, never in RE entity

---

## 4. Strategy B: Secured Debt + Venture Equity

### Maximum Founder Control

**Character:** Maximizes founder ownership. Real estate funded primarily through secured debt instruments, preserving 100% founder equity in the property. Operating company funded through minority equity. Founders accept debt service obligations as the trade-off for maximum control.

### Entity Structure

**TE Real Estate Holdings** (Cayman or Delaware) — 100% founder-owned
- No equity investors in the RE vehicle
- Capital raised via private secured notes

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- Founders (via Panamanian Holdings S.A.): 70%
- Investors: up to 30% equity

### Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Total Capital | Instrument | Rate / Terms |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| RE — Senior Secured Notes | $7,000,000–$8,000,000 | Promissory notes secured by property | 10–12% annual; interest-only 24 months; amortizing months 25–60; balloon at Year 5 |
| RE — Founder Equity | $2,000,000–$3,000,000 | Founder capital contribution | — |
| OpCo — Equity | $5,000,000–$6,800,000 | Preferred equity (30% investor) | 10–12% pref return + waterfall |
| **Total** | **$15,000,000–$16,800,000** | | |

*Note: RE debt and founder equity are inversely correlated — they sum to ~$10M for the property acquisition (e.g., $8M debt + $2M founder equity, or $7M debt + $3M founder equity). The component ranges shown are not independently variable.*

### Investor Returns — RE Secured Notes

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Interest Rate | 10–12% annual, fixed |
| Security | First-position lien/mortgage on ~$10M property |
| Interest-Only Period | Months 1–24 (operating ramp phase) |
| Amortization | Months 25–60 (principal + interest payments) |
| Balloon Payment | Remaining balance due at Month 60 (refinance or exit) |
| Forced Sale | On default, after 90-day cure period |
| LTV at Origination | 70–80% (strong collateral coverage) |
| Reporting | Quarterly property financials, annual independent appraisal |

**Illustrative Debt Service (on $7.5M at 11%):**

| Period | Annual Payment | Type |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Year 1 | $825,000 | Interest only |
| Year 2 | $825,000 | Interest only |
| Year 3 | ~$1,900,000 | Principal + interest (amortizing) |
| Year 4 | ~$1,900,000 | Principal + interest (amortizing) |
| Year 5 | Balloon (~$3,500,000) | Remaining principal |

Debt service is funded from TE Holdings revenue via intercompany management/lease fees from the OpCo to the RE entity, structured at arm's length.

### Investor Returns — OpCo Equity

Same structure as Strategy A:

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Preferred Return | 10–12% cumulative |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In all future equity rounds |
| Board Observer | One seat |
| Tag-along Rights | On any founder share transfer |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average, broad-based |

### Founder Control Mechanisms

- **100% equity ownership** of the RE entity (debt creates no ownership dilution)
- **70% equity ownership** of TE Wellness Holdings
- Full management control of both entities — no LP approval rights on property decisions
- Debt service obligation is the explicit trade-off for maintaining maximum ownership
- At Year 5, if debt is retired, founders own the property outright with no ongoing investor claims

### Why This Strategy Is Attractive

**For RE debt investors:**
- Fixed income with real asset security at 70–80% LTV
- Predictable cash flow (interest payments) regardless of operating performance
- First-position lien provides strong downside protection
- 10–12% yield in a low-rate environment — attractive to fixed-income-oriented family offices and credit funds
- No operating risk — return is contractual, not dependent on occupancy or revenue

**For OpCo equity investors:**
- Pure operating upside without real estate risk or complexity
- Same venture-style economics as Strategy A
- Clean separation: their equity buys operating business performance, not property speculation

**For founders:**
- Maximum ownership preservation — 100% of RE + 70% of OpCo
- Debt is refinanceable — once the property appreciates and cash flow stabilizes, founders can refinance at lower rates or retire the debt entirely
- No LP governance overhead on property decisions
- If the business succeeds at projected levels ($4.3M Y1 EBITDA, $20.3M Y5 EBITDA), debt service is manageable from operating cash flow

---

## 5. Strategy C: Convertible Hybrid

### Phased Capital with Optionality

**Character:** The most flexible approach. Capital enters as convertible and revenue-linked instruments that can evolve into equity based on milestones and performance. Allows founders to buy back positions over time. Appeals to investors who want downside protection with upside optionality.

### Entity Structure

**TE Real Estate Holdings** — property vehicle
- Convertible secured notes from investors (convert to up to 49% LP equity)
- Founders hold 100% pre-conversion; minimum 51% post-conversion

**TE Wellness Holdings** (Cayman, existing)
- Revenue-based financing + optional equity conversion (up to 30%)
- Founders hold 100% pre-conversion; minimum 70% post-conversion

### Capital Stack

| Vehicle | Total Capital | Instrument | Conversion Terms |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| RE — Convertible Secured Notes | $7,000,000–$8,000,000 | Convertible secured notes | 8% interest; auto-convert at Month 24 at $14–16M valuation cap into up to 49% LP equity; or repay at 1.5x |
| RE — Founder Equity | $2,000,000–$3,000,000 | Founder capital | — |
| OpCo — Revenue Participation | $3,000,000–$4,000,000 | Revenue-based financing | 5–8% of gross revenue until 2.0x capital returned; optional equity conversion at up to 30% |
| OpCo — Direct Equity (optional) | $1,000,000–$2,000,000 | Preferred equity | 12% pref return, 1x liquidation preference |
| **Total** | **$15,000,000–$16,800,000** | | |

*Note: Component ranges are correlated, not independently variable. RE convertible notes + founder equity sum to ~$10M for the property acquisition. OpCo tranches (revenue participation + direct equity) are sized to the remaining capital need. Specific combinations are calibrated to hit the $15–16.8M total.*

### Investor Returns — RE Convertible Notes

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Interest Rate | 8% annual (accruing, payable at conversion or maturity) |
| Security | First-position lien on ~$10M property |
| Auto-conversion | At Month 24 into LP equity at valuation cap of $14–16M |
| Conversion Cap | Ensures investors receive favorable entry price if property appreciates beyond cap |
| Maximum Conversion | Up to 49% LP equity (founders retain minimum 51%) |
| Founder Buy-back Option | Founders may repay notes at 1.5x within first 36 months to prevent conversion |
| Maturity (if no conversion) | Balloon repayment at Month 60 at 1.5x principal |
| Reporting | Quarterly financials, annual property appraisal |

**Illustrative Conversion Scenario:**

| Event | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| Property appreciates to $14M by Month 24 | Notes convert at $14M cap — investors receive equity at discount to market |
| Property appreciates to $18M by Month 24 | Notes convert at $14–16M cap — investors receive even larger effective discount |
| Founders exercise buy-back at Month 30 | Founders repay 1.5x ($10.5–12M on $7–8M) — investors earn 50% return; founders retain 100% |
| No conversion, no buy-back | Balloon repayment at Month 60 at 1.5x principal — investors earn 50% return over 5 years |

### Investor Returns — OpCo Revenue Participation

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Revenue Share | 5–8% of gross TE revenue, paid quarterly |
| Payment Commencement | Month 6 (post-launch) |
| Return Cap | Payments continue until investor receives 2.0x capital invested |
| Equity Dilution | None, unless investor elects conversion |
| Optional Equity Conversion | Investor may convert remaining balance to up to 30% equity at pre-agreed valuation |
| Founder Redemption | Founders may buy out revenue participation at any time for remaining 2.0x balance minus payments already received |

**Illustrative Revenue Participation Cash Flows (on $3.5M investment at 6% of revenue):**

| Year | Gross Revenue | 6% Share | Cumulative to Investor |
|------|--------------|----------|----------------------|
| Year 1 (6 months) | $5,150,000 | $309,000 | $309,000 |
| Year 2 | $19,600,000 | $1,176,000 | $1,485,000 |
| Year 3 | $26,300,000 | $1,578,000 | $3,063,000 |
| Year 4 | $30,500,000 | $1,830,000 | $4,893,000 |
| Year 5 | $34,000,000 | $2,040,000 | $6,933,000 |

At 6% of revenue, a $3.5M investment returns $6.9M by end of Year 5 — approaching the 2.0x cap ($7.0M) and fully returning it within the first weeks of Year 6. The investor earns a 2.0x return in approximately five years without any equity dilution to founders.

### Investor Returns — OpCo Direct Equity (Optional Tranche)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Preferred Return | 12% cumulative (premium for smaller tranche) |
| Liquidation Preference | 1x non-participating |
| Pro-rata Rights | In future rounds |
| Tag-along Rights | Standard |

### Founder Control Mechanisms

- **Pre-conversion:** 100% ownership of both entities — maximum control during proving period
- **Post-conversion (worst case):** 51% RE + 70% OpCo — meets all non-negotiable minimums
- **Buy-back options** allow founders to regain full ownership if cash flow permits
- IP always protected in the offshore structure regardless of conversion outcomes
- Revenue participation creates no governance rights — purely economic participation

### Why This Strategy Is Attractive

**For investors:**
- Downside protection via secured notes and revenue participation, **plus** upside optionality through equity conversion
- Milestone-driven: capital converts only after operating proof points (24 months of data)
- Revenue participation provides early cash returns — investors receive quarterly payments starting Month 6
- Conversion cap ensures favorable entry if the business outperforms
- Multiple exit paths: conversion to equity, buy-back at 1.5x, or maturity repayment

**For founders:**
- Time to prove the model before giving up equity
- Pre-conversion ownership is 100% of both entities — maximum negotiating leverage
- Buy-back provisions create alignment: if the business succeeds, founders can repurchase at returns attractive to both sides
- Revenue participation is self-extinguishing — once 2.0x is returned, the obligation ends
- Worst-case dilution (51% RE + 70% OpCo) still meets all control requirements

## 6. Strategy Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Strategy A: Parallel Equity | Strategy B: Secured Debt + Equity | Strategy C: Convertible Hybrid |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Total Capital Raised** | $15–16.8M | $15–16.8M | $15–16.8M |

## 7. IP Protection Framework

### Consistent Across All Three Strategies

Regardless of which investment structure is selected, the intellectual property, brand, AI/data assets, and technology platform are protected by the same offshore architecture. Investors in neither the RE entity nor the OpCo gain ownership of IP — they gain economic exposure to the revenue generated by IP.

### IP Ownership Map

| IP Asset | Owner | Location |
|----------|-------|----------|
| TE healing center platform (app, AI agents, algorithms) | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| TE spiritual content (courses, protocols, books) | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| TE brand and trademarks | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Anonymized outcome database | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| AI/ML trained models | TE Wellness Holdings | Cayman Islands |
| Light Brands consulting frameworks | Light Brands Consulting Ltd | Cook Islands |
| Light Brands SaaS products | Light Brands Consulting Ltd | Cook Islands |

### How IP Is Protected

**1. All TE IP is owned by TE Wellness Holdings (Cayman) — not by the RE entity.**
The real estate vehicle holds the physical property only. Technology, brand, data, and all intangible assets reside in Holdings, which is a separate Cayman Exempted Company with its own corporate governance.

**2. All technology development occurs via Light Brands Studio (Dubai) under work-for-hire.**
Studio creates all IP under the Development Services Agreement with Holdings. IP is assigned to Holdings upon delivery. Studio retains no product-specific IP. This arrangement satisfies DEMPE requirements with real substance (office, employees, equipment) in Dubai.

**3. Light Brands IP is owned by CI IBC (Cook Islands).**
LB-specific consulting frameworks, SaaS products, and spiritual technology tools are owned by the Cook Islands entity, entirely separate from both the RE vehicle and TE Holdings investor equity.

**4. Panama PIF → Panamanian Holdings S.A. holds the founder's ~70% of Holdings.**
The PIF provides the ultimate layer of asset protection. The S.A. intermediate holdco creates double-layer separation. Creditors would need to pierce two separate Panamanian legal entities to reach operating equity.

**5. Investor equity in Holdings does NOT grant IP ownership.**
Holdings owns the IP as corporate property. Investors hold equity in Holdings — they participate in the economic value generated by the IP, but the IP itself is a corporate asset of Holdings, not divisible among shareholders. This is standard corporate law.

**6. IP is licensed to downstream entities at arm's length.**
Content is licensed from Holdings to the Church (royalty, UBIT-exempt). Operating technology is made available to Mexico OpCo through the Holdings → Studio → OpCo service chain. All licenses are priced at arm's length with transfer pricing documentation.

**7. IP is never collateralized against RE debt.**
In Strategy B (secured debt) and Strategy C (convertible notes), the security interest is limited to the physical property. No lien, pledge, or encumbrance attaches to any IP asset in any strategy.

## 8. Recommended Approach

### Lead with Strategy A, Offer Strategy B and C as Alternatives

**Strategy A (Parallel Equity)** is the recommended lead structure for the following reasons:

1. **Institutional familiarity.** Dual-vehicle LP/equity structures are the most recognized format among family offices, PE funds, and sophisticated angel networks. The structure requires the least explanation and positions TE as institutionally serious from day one.

2. **Two distinct investor conversations.** RE investors and OpCo investors have fundamentally different risk appetites and return expectations. Strategy A cleanly separates these conversations, allowing the fundraise to proceed on parallel tracks.

3. **Simplest legal implementation.** Two standard formation documents (LP agreement + Cayman SHA) with well-established precedent. Legal counsel can draft from templates with minimal customization.

4. **Preserves optionality.** If RE fundraising proves difficult at 49% LP equity, founders can pivot to Strategy B (secured debt for the RE portion) without affecting the OpCo raise. If certain investors prefer convertible structures, elements of Strategy C can be offered on an investor-by-investor basis.

### When to Consider Strategy B

- Target investor pool is heavily weighted toward credit-oriented family offices and fixed-income allocators
- Founders have access to $2–3M in personal/affiliated capital for the RE equity contribution
- Founders have high conviction in the ability to service 10–12% annual interest from operating cash flow
- Preserving 100% RE ownership is a strategic priority (e.g., for future refinancing or property portfolio expansion)

### When to Consider Strategy C

- Lead investors are sophisticated and comfortable with convertible and revenue-participation instruments
- Founders want maximum time to prove the operating model before committing to permanent dilution
- The fundraise benefits from milestone-based conversion triggers that align investor and founder incentives
- The capital raise is structured in tranches over time rather than a single close

### Hybrid Approach

The strategies are not mutually exclusive. A practical hybrid might look like:

| Tranche | Instrument | Amount | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| RE — Senior Notes | Strategy B secured debt | $5,000,000 | Credit-oriented family offices |
| RE — LP Equity | Strategy A equity | $2,000,000–$3,000,000 | RE-focused investors |
| RE — Founder Equity | Founder capital | $2,000,000–$3,000,000 | Founders |
| OpCo — Preferred Equity | Strategy A equity | $1,500,000–$2,000,000 | Growth-oriented investors |
| OpCo — Revenue Participation | Strategy C RBF | $2,000,000–$3,000,000 | Cash-flow-oriented investors |
| OpCo — Convertible Note | Strategy C convertible | $1,000,000–$2,000,000 | Venture-oriented investors |

This hybrid approach maximizes the addressable investor universe by offering instruments tailored to different risk/return preferences — all while maintaining founder control above the 51%/70% thresholds.

### Entity Formation Sequence

```
1. TE Real Estate Holdings (Cayman or Delaware) — new
2. TE RE Mexico, S.A. de C.V. — new (subsidiary of RE Holdings)
3. Fideicomiso (bank trust) — established for property acquisition
4. Update TE Wellness Holdings SHA — to reflect new investor terms
5. Execute intercompany agreements between RE and OpCo entities
