# The Property-for-Equity Deal

**He gives us the property. We give him 14% of everything we build. His 14% is worth $20M in 5 years. We can buy him out anytime.**

---

## The Narrative

He put $28M into this property. The market says it's worth $12M. That's the market's number — not ours.

We value what he built at $20M. Not based on what a broker says. Based on what we're going to build on top of it. His property is the foundation of a $147M enterprise. And we're giving him a piece of that enterprise that's worth $20M in 5 years — more than what any buyer on the open market would pay him today.

He's not selling at a loss. He's converting his property into equity in something bigger than a building.

> "The market values your property at $12 million. We value it at $20 million — because we know what it's going to become. Here's your $20 million. It's called 14% of everything we build."

## What 14% Is Worth — Year by Year

| Year | Enterprise Value | His 14% | What's Happening |
|------|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $29,000,000 | $4,060,000 | Building + first guests |
| Year 2 | $55,000,000 | $7,700,000 | Ramping to capacity |
| Year 3 | $87,000,000 | $12,180,000 | Full operations + expansion planning |
| Year 4 | $110,000,000 | $15,400,000 | Brand established + licensing |
| Year 5 | $147,000,000 | **$20,580,000** | Global platform + multiple revenue streams |

His $12M property becomes $20M+ in equity. That's not a loss. That's a 70%+ return on the market price.

## Why 14% — The Math

```
His property (market value):          ~$12,000,000
Our Year 5 enterprise value:          $147,000,000
14% of $147M:                         $20,580,000

His "return" on market value:         +$8,580,000 (72% gain)
His "recovery" vs. $28M cost:         73% recovered through equity alone
                                      (vs. 43% recovered by selling for $11.9M)
```

**Why not 25%?** Because 14% already gives him $20M — more than the property is worth on the open market. 25% would be $36.75M, which overvalues a $12M property by 3x. 14% is fair, generous, and defensible.

**Why not 10%?** Because $14.7M at Year 5 doesn't clear the $12M market value by enough margin. 14% gives him a clear premium — $20M on a $12M contribution. That's the sweet spot.

## What the Seller Gets

```
SELLER gets:
  14% of OpCo ---------> Worth $20M at Year 5
  Advisory role --------> $50K/year + annual retreat stay
  Founding Steward -----> Permanent title, name on the wall
  Buyout option --------> We can buy him out at FMV anytime
                          (he gets liquidity whenever we're ready)
                         ---------
                         TOTAL: ~$20M+ over 5 years
                         vs. $11.9M cash from a sale
```

**Plain English:**
- 14% ownership in a company projected to be worth $147M
- Non-voting — he has no say in operations, but he benefits from every dollar we earn
- $50K/year advisory fee — real money for showing up to quarterly calls
- A complimentary annual retreat stay on the property he built
- His name on the wall. Permanently.
- If we want to buy him out early — say Year 3 when his 14% is worth $12M — we pay him FMV and he walks away with cash

## What We Get

```
WE get:
  The property ---------> At zero cash cost (equity only)
  86% of OpCo ---------> Worth $126M+ at Year 5
  Full voting control --> His 14% is non-voting
  IP protected ---------> All IP stays in Cayman entity
  Buyout optionality ---> Can consolidate to 100% whenever we want
  Capital efficiency ---> Only need $5M for operations (not $15-17M)
  Built-in advocate ----> He owns 14% — he's telling everyone about us
```

---

## The Buyout Clause

We can buy his 14% at any time. He can't force a sale — only we can trigger the buyout.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Who can trigger** | Founders only (our option, not his) |
| **Price** | Fair Market Value at time of buyout |
| **FMV determination** | Independent third-party valuation OR agreed formula (trailing 12-month EBITDA x agreed multiple) |
| **Payment** | Cash, or 50% cash + 50% over 12 months |
| **Notice** | 60 days written notice |
| **When** | Any time after Year 1 |

**Why this matters:**
- Year 2: If we want to consolidate before a big raise, we buy him out at ~$7.7M
- Year 3: Before expansion, buy out at ~$12.2M
- Year 5: After full maturity, buy out at ~$20.6M
- Or never — let him ride and collect distributions

We control the timing. He gets the upside whenever we decide to move.

## The Pitch

> "You built this property with $28 million and 8 years of your life. The market wants to hand you $12 million and forget your name.
>
> We're offering you something the market can't — $20 million in equity in a company that's going to be worth $147 million. Your property doesn't get flipped. It becomes the birthplace of a global healing movement. And you're not a former owner. You're a founding partner.
>
> Your 14% is non-voting — we run the show. But every dollar we earn, you earn 14 cents. Every life we change, your property made it possible. And if we ever want to buy you out, we pay you fair market value in cash.
>
> You told us you want more purpose. This is it."

## Comparison: Sell vs. Equity Deal

| | Sell for $11.9M | Property-for-Equity |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash Day 1** | $11,900,000 | $0 |
| **Year 5 value** | $11,900,000 (spent) | $20,580,000 (growing) |
| **Total return** | $11.9M — done | $20M+ and still climbing |
| **Involvement** | Gone | Founding Steward |
| **What happens to property** | Flipped or bulldozed | Healing center changing lives |
| **His story** | "Sold at a 57% loss" | "I'm a founding partner" |

## Protections — Both Sides

**For us:**
- Non-voting equity — zero governance for him
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (if he disengages, unvested shares forfeit)
- Buyout at FMV at any time (our option)
- ROFR if he tries to transfer
- Drag-along if we sell 100%
- Non-compete (5 years)
- All IP stays in Cayman — untouched

**For him:**
- Tag-along if we sell (he participates on same terms)
- Anti-dilution protection (weighted average)
- Quarterly financial summaries
- Annual complimentary retreat stay
- FMV buyout — can't be squeezed below fair value
- Vesting accelerates on change of control

## What We Need From Him

1. Clean title to the property (no liens, no mortgage)
2. Divorce court approval (if marital property)
3. Sign the equity agreement + advisory agreement
4. Take the property off market
5. Show up to quarterly calls and be an advocate

That's it. No cash from him. No complicated financing. Property for equity. One deal.

---

**Bottom line:** We're not asking him to sell at a loss. We're asking him to invest his property into something worth $147M — and keep 14% of it. His $12M property becomes $20M. He gets purpose, equity, and a legacy. We get the property, control, and a built-in advocate. One clean deal.
