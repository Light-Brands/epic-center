## 1. The Big Idea: What If the App IS the Business? {#1-the-big-idea}

Every strategy document so far has treated the healing center as the business and technology as a cost center or licensing opportunity. This document inverts that assumption entirely.

**What if the platform is the principal and the Mexican healing center is just a contracted service provider?**

This is not science fiction. It is the operating model of the world's largest companies:

- **Uber** doesn't employ drivers or own cars. It operates a platform that connects riders with independent driver-partners. Uber collects 100% of the fare, pays drivers their share, and keeps the margin in the Netherlands (historically) or a favorable jurisdiction.
- **Airbnb** doesn't own properties. It operates a platform that connects guests with hosts. Guest payments flow to Airbnb's Irish entity, which pays hosts minus the platform fee.
- **Booking.com** processes $150B+ in annual bookings. The Dutch entity collects and then remits to hotels, keeping 15-25% as a platform commission.
- **Amazon Marketplace** collects all customer payments, pays sellers minus fees. The platform entity earns the economics.

The common pattern:

1. **Guest/customer pays the platform** (not the local operator)
2. **Platform deducts its fees** (technology, brand, data, marketplace commission)
3. **Platform remits the remainder** to the local service provider
4. **Local operator has minimal profit** because the platform captures the value
5. **Platform entity sits in a favorable tax jurisdiction**

For TE, this means:

- A guest in Toronto books a 14-day program on the **TE Platform** (UK entity)
- Guest pays **$37,800 to TE Platform Ltd (UK)**
- TE Platform pays **TE Ops Mexico** a service delivery fee (cost + small margin)
- TE Platform retains the difference as platform revenue
- Platform revenue is taxed at **10% under UK Patent Box** (or potentially lower)
- Mexican OpCo shows minimal profit (or break-even) and pays minimal Mexican tax

**The question is: can this withstand scrutiny?**

The answer is nuanced. This document breaks down exactly how to structure it, where the opportunities are, where the lines are, and what will get you in trouble.

## 2. How Uber and Airbnb Rewrote the Rules {#2-how-uber-and-airbnb-rewrote-the-rules}

### 2.1 The Uber Model

Uber's pre-2019 structure was the gold standard of platform-as-principal tax engineering:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  UBER B.V. (Netherlands)                            │
│  Holds global IP outside US                         │
│  Collects 100% of rider payments globally           │
│                                                     │
│  ├── Uber International B.V.                        │
│  │   (Netherlands - sublicenses IP globally)        │
│  │                                                  │
│  │   ├── Uber Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.            │
│  │   │   (Limited-risk service provider)            │
│  │   │   Earns: cost + 8-10% margin                │
│  │   │   Mexican taxable income: minimal            │
│  │   │                                              │
│  │   ├── Uber Brazil Ltda                           │
│  │   │   (Same model)                               │
│  │   │                                              │
│  │   └── [Every other country]                      │
│  │       (Same model)                               │
│  │                                                  │
│  └── Uber Bermuda (historical IP ownership)         │
│      Innovation Box / no tax                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key features:**
- Riders paid Uber B.V. (Netherlands), not the local entity
- Local entities were "limited-risk service providers" - they provided marketing, driver onboarding, and support services
- The local entity had no right to the IP, no customer relationships, no brand ownership
- Transfer pricing was set at cost + small margin for the local entity
- The IP owner (originally Bermuda, now Netherlands) captured the residual profit

**Outcome:** Uber paid an effective global tax rate in the low single digits for years.

**What changed:** OECD BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) reforms, the EU's Digital Services Tax proposals, and country-level pushback (France, UK, Italy). Uber restructured in 2019-2020 to bring more substance to high-revenue markets. But the fundamental model still works for companies with genuine technology platforms.

### 2.2 The Airbnb Model

Airbnb's structure was even more elegant because Airbnb never physically delivers any service:

```
Guest → Pays Airbnb Ireland Ltd → Airbnb pays host (minus 3-15% service fee)
                                 → Irish entity earns service fee
                                 → IP in Ireland (KDB: 6.25%)
```

**Why Airbnb's model is highly defensible:**
- Airbnb genuinely provides the search, matching, trust/safety, payment processing, and guarantee
- The host provides the accommodation
- The service fee is clearly for platform services
- Ireland has substantial IP development operations (thousands of employees)

### 2.3 The Booking.com Model

Most relevant to TE because Booking.com is in the **hospitality** space:

- Guest pays Booking.com (Netherlands) the full room rate
- Booking.com remits to the hotel minus its 15-25% commission
- Hotel recognizes revenue only for the net amount received
- Booking.com's commission is taxed in the Netherlands at favorable rates
- Hotel in Mexico (or anywhere) has lower revenue and lower taxable income

### 2.4 What Makes These Defensible

The models above work because:

1. **The platform genuinely creates value** - matching, trust, payment processing, brand
2. **The local entity genuinely has limited functions** - it provides physical service delivery only
3. **Customer relationships belong to the platform** - the guest is a customer of Uber/Airbnb, not of the driver/host
4. **IP is developed where the entity claims** - real employees, real R&D, real operations
5. **Transfer prices are arm's length** - comparable companies accept similar margins for similar functions

### 3.2 The Fundamental Shift

| Aspect | Traditional Model | Platform-as-Principal Model |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Who is the guest's counterparty?** | Mexican OpCo | TE Platform Ltd (UK) |
| **Who collects payment?** | Mexican OpCo | TE Platform Ltd (UK) |
| **Who owns the guest relationship?** | Mexican OpCo | TE Platform Ltd (UK) |
| **Who sets pricing?** | Mexican OpCo | TE Platform Ltd (UK) |
| **Who delivers the physical service?** | Mexican OpCo | Mexican OpCo (as contractor) |
| **What does Mexican OpCo earn?** | Full revenue minus costs | Cost-plus service delivery fee |
| **Where is the profit?** | Mexico (30% tax) | UK (10% Patent Box) |

---

## 4. Revenue Stream Redesign: Everything Through the Platform {#4-revenue-stream-redesign}

### 4.1 Current Revenue Streams (from data.ts)

| Stream | Y1 Revenue | Y5 Revenue | 5-Year Total |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Program Revenue | $10,300,000 | $34,000,000 | $120,700,000 |
| Bio-Optimization Premium | $309,000 | $1,000,000 | $3,547,000 |
| Post-Care Subscriptions | $139,000 | $461,000 | $1,633,000 |
| **Total HC Revenue** | **$10,748,000** | **$35,461,000** | **$125,880,000** |
| Villa Sales (separate) | $16,000,000 | $0 | $96,000,000 |
| Villa Management Fees | ~$250,000 | ~$1,700,000 | ~$5,000,000 |

### 4.2 Redesigned Revenue Streams: Platform Capture

Under the platform-as-principal model, all guest-facing revenue flows through the UK platform entity. The question is: **how much can the platform legitimately retain?**

| Revenue Stream | Total Amount | Platform Captures | OpCo Receives | Justification |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Program booking** | $26,600/guest | Platform commission: 25-35% | Delivery fee: 65-75% | Platform provides booking, matching, clinical protocol IP, AI personalization, scheduling, payment processing |
| **Bio-optimization** | ~$2,600/guest | 80-100% | 0-20% | Delivered primarily through app (wearable integration, personalized protocols, AI analysis) |
| **Post-care subscriptions** | $1,000/yr | 100% | 0% | 100% digital delivery — telemedicine, app content, AI coaching |
| **Villa tokenization** | $2M avg | Marketplace commission: 8-15% | Construction fee: cost + margin | Platform provides marketplace, blockchain infra, legal structuring |
| **Villa management** | 25% of rental | Platform commission: 40-60% of mgmt fee | Operations: 40-60% | Platform provides booking engine, dynamic pricing, guest management |

### 4.3 The Guest Journey: Every Touchpoint Is Platform

To defend the platform-as-principal characterization, every guest touchpoint must genuinely occur on/through the platform:

**Pre-Arrival (100% Platform)**
1. Guest discovers TE through the app / website (UK platform)
2. Guest completes intake questionnaire (app)
3. AI assessment generates preliminary clinical profile (app)
4. Pharmacogenomic test ordered through the platform
5. Payment processed by TE Platform Ltd (Stripe UK)
6. Travel concierge coordinated through app
7. Welcome package / preparation content delivered through app

**During Stay (Hybrid — Platform + Physical Delivery)**
8. Daily schedule managed and delivered through app
9. Clinical protocols selected by AI engine (platform IP)
10. Dosing calculations generated by pharmacogenomic platform
11. Progress tracking via wearables integrated with app
12. Brain mapping analysis performed by platform AI
13. Physical treatments administered by Mexican OpCo staff (contracted service)
14. Meals, accommodation, housekeeping by Mexican OpCo (contracted service)

**Post-Stay (100% Platform)**
15. Integration protocols delivered through app
16. Telemedicine check-ins via app
17. AI-powered coaching and adjustment via app
18. Community features via app
19. Bio-optimization ongoing protocols via app
20. Subscription billing through TE Platform Ltd

**This creates a defensible argument:** The majority of the guest experience is technology-delivered. The Mexican OpCo provides the physical environment and hands-on medical services — important, but not the entirety of the value proposition.

---

## 5. Mexican OpCo: The Cost-Plus Service Provider {#5-mexican-opco}

### 5.1 The Commissionaire / Limited-Risk Model

Under international tax law, a **commissionaire** or **limited-risk service provider** is an entity that:

- Acts on behalf of a principal (TE Platform Ltd)
- Bears limited business risk (doesn't own the IP, brand, or customer relationships)
- Performs routine functions (facility operations, staffing, compliance)
- Is compensated on a **cost-plus basis** (total costs + arm's length markup)

This is exactly how Uber, Airbnb, and global pharma companies structure their local operations.

### 5.2 What Mexican OpCo Does (and What It Doesn't)

| Mexican OpCo DOES | Mexican OpCo DOES NOT |
|---|---|
| Employ medical staff, housekeeping, F&B, maintenance | Own any IP, technology, algorithms, or protocols |
| Operate the physical facility | Own guest relationships or data |
| Hold Mexican health permits (COFEPRIS) | Set pricing for any service |
| Maintain the property | Make strategic decisions about clinical programs |
| Deliver physical treatments per platform protocols | Develop or modify the technology platform |
| Comply with Mexican labor law | Market to or acquire guests |
| Handle local regulatory compliance | Process guest payments |

### 5.3 Cost-Plus Pricing

The arm's length markup for limited-risk service providers in Mexico typically ranges from **5-15%**, depending on the industry and functions performed:

| Function Type | Comparable Margin | Source |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| Contract manufacturing (maquiladora) | 5-8% | OECD TP guidelines, Mexican maquiladora rules |
| Limited-risk distributor | 2-5% | SAT guidelines, OECD benchmarks |
| Contract service provider (healthcare) | 8-15% | Healthcare outsourcing benchmarks, comparable companies |
| Research & development services | 10-15% | OECD BEPS, R&D service provider comparables |

**Recommended margin for TE Ops Mexico: 8-12% on total costs**

This means if Mexican OpCo's total operating costs (staff, facility, supplies, overhead) are $6 million, it would earn $6.48M - $6.72M in service fees and report $480K - $720K in taxable profit.

### 5.4 What Goes Into Mexican OpCo's Cost Base

From data.ts, the cost structure of the healing center at Year 1:

| Cost Category | Amount | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| COGS (medical supplies, lab, pharma) | $1,870,000 | Direct treatment costs |
| Facility costs | $576,000 | Rent/maintenance/utilities |
| Personnel | $2,064,996 | Medical staff, operations staff |
| Professional services | $174,996 | Legal, accounting, consulting |
| Technology (local IT) | $228,000 | Local infrastructure only |
| Marketing (local only) | $100,000 | Reduced — platform handles acquisition |
| G&A | $502,004 | Admin, insurance, etc. |
| **Total Cost Base** | **~$5,516,000** | |
| **Plus 10% margin** | **~$551,600** | |
| **OpCo Revenue** | **~$6,068,000** | |
| **OpCo Taxable Income** | **~$551,600** | |
| **Mexican Tax (30%)** | **~$165,480** | |

Compare to current model:
- Current OpCo taxable income (EBITDA): **$4,672,000**
- Current Mexican tax: **~$1,198,000** (on EBT of ~$3,995,000)

**Tax reduction in Year 1: ~$1,033,000** (from ~$1,198K to ~$165K)

### 5.5 SAT's Perspective on Commissionaire Structures

This is the critical risk factor. Mexico's SAT (Tax Administration Service) has been **aggressively scrutinizing** commissionaire and limited-risk structures since 2020:

**SAT's position:**
- If the economic activity occurs in Mexico, Mexico should tax the profit
- Commissionaire arrangements may create a **permanent establishment (PE)** for the foreign principal
- The Mexican entity's functions, assets, and risks (FAR) analysis must justify the limited return
- Transfer pricing must be supported by robust documentation

**SAT's tools:**
- Article 2 of Mexico's Income Tax Law: PE rules (fixed place of business, dependent agent)
- Article 179-180: Transfer pricing adjustment powers
- Article 28(XXIX): Non-deductibility for payments to related parties in REFIPRE jurisdictions
- Mexico's implementation of OECD BEPS Action 7 (preventing artificial avoidance of PE)

**Risk level: MEDIUM-HIGH.** This structure is legally defensible but will attract SAT scrutiny. Robust transfer pricing documentation and genuine substance are essential.

## 6. The Math: Getting Mexico to Break-Even {#6-the-math}

### 6.1 The Goal

Transform the Mexican OpCo from a **profit center** (43% EBITDA margin, 30% tax on substantial income) to a **break-even or minimal-profit entity** by legitimately routing value through the platform.

### 6.2 Year 1: The Extraction Math

Starting point: $10,748,000 total healing center revenue (from data.ts)

**Platform Revenue Capture Model:**

| Revenue Component | Total | Platform Takes | OpCo Receives | Mechanism |
|------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Guest payments | $10,748,000 | — | — | All collected by Platform |
| Platform commission (booking, matching, payment processing) | — | $1,612,200 (15%) | — | Direct platform revenue |
| Technology royalty (clinical protocols, AI, pharma platform) | — | $537,400 (5%) | — | IP license fee |
| Brand license fee | — | $322,440 (3%) | — | Trademark / trade dress license |
| SaaS platform fee | — | $360,000 ($30K/mo) | — | Monthly subscription |
| Data analytics & processing fee | — | $120,000 ($10K/mo) | — | Data processing services |
| Training & certification fee | — | $180,000 ($15K/mo) | — | Clinical protocol training |
| Management / headquarters fee | — | $214,960 (2%) | — | Central management services |
| **Total Platform Extraction** | | **$3,347,000 (31.1%)** | | |
| **Remaining to OpCo** | | | **$7,401,000** | Service delivery fee |
| **OpCo Total Costs** | | | **~$6,076,000** | Cost base + depreciation |
| **OpCo Gross Margin** | | | **~$1,325,000** | |
| **Less: Interest on intercompany loan** | | $300,000 | | 3:1 thin-cap safe harbor |
| **OpCo Pre-Tax Income** | | | **~$1,025,000** | |
| **Mexican Tax (30%)** | | | **~$307,500** | |

**Year 1 Result:**
- Platform pre-tax income: ~$3,347,000 (taxed at 10% UK Patent Box = **$334,700**)
- Mexican OpCo pre-tax income: ~$1,025,000 (taxed at 30% = **$307,500**)
- **Combined tax: ~$642,200** vs current model ~$1,198,000
- **Savings: ~$556,000 in Year 1**

### 6.3 Year 5: Where the Real Savings Are

Starting point: $35,461,000 total healing center revenue

| Revenue Component | Total | Platform Takes | Mechanism |
|------------------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Guest payments | $35,461,000 | — | Collected by Platform |
| Platform commission (15%) | — | $5,319,150 | Booking, matching, payments |
| Technology royalty (5%) | — | $1,773,050 | IP license |
| Brand license (3%) | — | $1,063,830 | Trademark license |
| SaaS platform fee | — | $600,000 ($50K/mo) | Scaled platform |
| Data analytics fee | — | $360,000 ($30K/mo) | Data processing |
| Training & certification | — | $300,000 ($25K/mo) | Protocol training |
| Management fee (2%) | — | $709,220 | Central management |
| **Total Platform Extraction** | | **$10,125,250 (28.6%)** | |
| **Remaining to OpCo** | | $25,335,750 | Service delivery |
| **OpCo Total Costs** | | ~$14,000,000 | Scaled cost base |
| **OpCo Pre-Tax Income** | | ~$11,335,750 | |
| **Less: Intercompany charges** | | ~$10,000,000 | Additional legitimate charges |
| **OpCo Taxable Income** | | ~$1,335,750 | |
| **Mexican Tax (30%)** | | **~$400,725** | |

Wait — that still leaves too much in Mexico. Let's look at how to push further.

### 6.4 The Aggressive Model: Approaching Break-Even

To get Mexico closer to break-even, we need to increase the platform extraction rate. But there are limits:

**Maximum Defensible Extraction Rates:**

| Charge | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive | Uber/Airbnb Comparable |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Platform commission | 10% | 15% | 20% | Uber: 20-30%, Airbnb: 15-20% |
| Technology royalty | 3% | 5% | 7% | Pharma: 4-8%, Tech: 5-15% |
| Brand license | 2% | 3% | 5% | Hotel franchises: 3-6% |
| SaaS fee | $20K/mo | $30K/mo | $50K/mo | Enterprise SaaS benchmarks |
| Data fee | $5K/mo | $10K/mo | $20K/mo | Health data analytics market |
| Training fee | $10K/mo | $15K/mo | $25K/mo | Clinical training programs |
| Management fee | 2% | 3% | 5% | Hotel management: 3-5% base |
| Intercompany interest | 6% rate | 8% rate | 10% rate | Mexican thin-cap: 3:1 D/E |
| **Total extraction** | **~22%** | **~31%** | **~42%** | |

**At the aggressive level (42% extraction on $35.5M Y5):**
- Platform captures: ~$14.9M
- OpCo receives: ~$20.6M
- OpCo costs: ~$14M (personnel, facility, COGS, overhead scaled to Y5)
- OpCo pre-tax income: ~$6.6M
- OpCo intercompany interest: ~$1.5M (3:1 thin-cap on estimated equity)
- OpCo taxable income: ~$5.1M
- Mexican tax: ~$1.53M

Even at aggressive levels, it is **very difficult** to get a profitable, growing operation in Mexico to true break-even through legitimate intercompany charges alone. **The operations are real, the staff is in Mexico, the guests are in Mexico, and Mexico will insist on taxing an appropriate return on those functions.**

### 6.5 The Realistic Target

**True break-even is probably indefensible.** Here's why:

- SAT will benchmark against comparable healthcare facilities
- A facility with $14M in costs, 1,280 guests/year, and complex medical operations is not a "routine" service provider
- The functional analysis will show that medical staff exercise significant judgment
- A 0% return on those functions fails any arm's length test

**The defensible sweet spot:**
- **Year 1:** OpCo earns 8-10% on costs (~$500K-$600K profit, ~$150K-$180K tax)
- **Year 5:** OpCo earns 8-10% on costs (~$1.1M-$1.4M profit, ~$330K-$420K tax)
- **Platform captures 25-35% of total revenue**
- **Effective combined tax rate: 12-18%** (vs. 30% if all in Mexico)

This is still a **massive reduction** from the current model where Mexico taxes the full profit.

## 7. The Intercompany Charge Stack {#7-the-intercompany-charge-stack}

### 7.1 How to Layer the Charges

The key to maximizing extraction from Mexico is **stacking multiple legitimate charges**, each of which individually falls within arm's length ranges. No single charge is extreme, but the combination is powerful.

```
Total Revenue: $10,748,000 (Y1)

```

### 7.2 Each Layer's Defensibility

| Layer | Arm's Length? | SAT Risk | Key Defense |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Platform commission 15% | Yes — Booking.com charges 15-25%, Uber 20-30% | Low-Medium | Guest genuinely books and pays through platform |
| Tech royalty 5% | Yes — pharma IP royalties 4-8% of revenue | Medium | Must prove IP is genuinely owned/developed by UK entity |
| Brand license 3% | Yes — hotel franchise fees 3-6% typical | Low | Standard in hospitality industry |
| SaaS $30K/mo | Yes — enterprise health-tech SaaS $20-60K/mo | Low | Software genuinely hosted in UK/cloud, accessed remotely |
| Data processing $10K/mo | Yes — health analytics comparable | Low | Data processing genuinely occurs outside Mexico |
| Training $15K/mo | Moderate — depends on content origin | Medium | Must be developed by UK entity |
| Management fee 2% | Yes — hotel management 3-5% baseline | Low | Standard intercompany management charge |
| Interest on loan | Yes — if within thin-cap limits | Medium | Must be at arm's length rate, within 3:1 D/E |

### 7.3 The Deductibility Question

Each charge must be **deductible** in Mexico for it to reduce Mexican taxable income. Key requirements under Mexican law:

1. **Strictly necessary for the business** (Art. 27 LISR): Each service/license must be demonstrably used in operations
2. **Properly documented**: Contracts, invoices, and transfer pricing documentation for each charge
3. **Arm's length pricing**: Transfer pricing study supporting each rate
4. **REFIPRE safe**: Payments must go to jurisdictions with effective rate >22.5% (UK qualifies at 25%)
5. **Not artificially inflated**: SAT can disallow charges that appear artificially inflated
6. **Withholding tax applied**: Royalties at 10% (UK treaty), services at 0% (if Article 7 applies) or 25%

## 8. Villa Tokenization via Blockchain {#8-villa-tokenization}

### 8.1 Why Tokenize Villas?

Traditional villa sales flow through the Mexican PropCo, triggering Mexican capital gains and ISR. But if villas are sold as **digital tokens** representing fractional or full ownership rights, the point of sale shifts.

**The opportunity:**
- 48 villas × $2M average = **$96M in total sales revenue**
- Development fee (10-15%): **$9.6M - $14.4M** (currently taxed at 30% in Mexico)
- If tokenized and sold through a UK marketplace entity, a significant portion of the margin can be captured by the platform

### 8.3 How This Changes the Economics

**Traditional model (all in Mexico):**
| Item | Amount | Tax |
|------|--------|-----|
| Villa sale price | $2,000,000 | |
| Construction cost | $800,000-$1,200,000 | |
| Gross margin | $800,000-$1,200,000 | |
| Mexican ISR (30%) | $240,000-$360,000 per villa | |
| Total tax on 48 villas | **$11.5M - $17.3M** | |

**Tokenized model (platform-as-principal):**
| Item | Amount | Entity | Tax |
|------|--------|--------|-----|
| Token sale price | $2,000,000 | Platform (UK) | |
| Platform marketplace commission (12%) | $240,000 | UK - 10% Patent Box | $24,000 |
| Remaining to construction | $1,760,000 | | |
| Construction cost | $800,000-$1,200,000 | Mexico PropCo | |
| PropCo margin (10% on cost) | $80,000-$120,000 | Mexico - 30% | $24,000-$36,000 |
| Excess (if any) | returned to platform | UK | |
| Tax per villa | | | **$48,000-$60,000** |
| Total tax on 48 villas | | | **$2.3M - $2.9M** |

**Potential savings on villas alone: $9M - $14M over the build-out period.**

### 8.4 Legal Framework for Villa Tokens

**Mexico:**
- Mexico's Fintech Law (Ley para Regular las Instituciones de Tecnologia Financiera, 2018) regulates virtual assets and crypto exchanges
- Security tokens representing real estate ownership may require CNBV (National Banking and Securities Commission) registration
- Foreign buyers still need a fideicomiso for property in the restricted zone
- The token represents an interest in the SPV or trust, not direct ownership of the land

**UK:**
- UK FCA treats security tokens as specified investments under MiFID II
- Token issuance may require FCA approval or fall under an exemption
- Crypto assets are taxable in the UK but at the entity level (corporation tax / Patent Box if qualifying)

**Global (buyers):**
- US buyers: SEC registration or exemption (Reg D, Reg S for non-US)
- Canadian buyers: CSA securities regulation
- EU buyers: MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, fully effective 2025)

**Key risk:** Mexican authorities may argue that the sale of property located in Mexico is Mexican-source income regardless of the tokenization wrapper. This requires careful legal structuring — the token must represent an interest in a non-Mexican entity that has rights to the property through the fideicomiso, not a direct transfer of Mexican real property.

### 8.5 Blockchain Technology Stack

| Component | Purpose | Recommended Platform |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Token standard | Security token issuance | ERC-3643 (T-REX) on Ethereum / Polygon |
| Smart contracts | Automated compliance, dividends | Solidity with on-chain compliance |
| KYC/AML | Investor verification | Integrated with platform (Chainalysis, Onfido) |
| Custody | Token storage | Institutional custody (Fireblocks, Copper) |
| Marketplace | Primary and secondary trading | Built into TE Platform |
| Payment rails | Fiat on/off ramp | Circle (USDC), Stripe Crypto |
| Revenue distribution | Rental income to token holders | Smart contract automated distribution |

### 8.6 Crypto Payment Acceptance

For guests who want to pay in crypto:

- **Platform accepts:** BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT
- **Payment processed by:** UK platform entity (using crypto payment processor)
- **Converted to:** GBP or USD at point of sale
- **Tax treatment:** Normal business income for the UK entity
- **Mexican OpCo receives:** Fiat service delivery fee (no crypto exposure)
- **Advantage:** Payment is demonstrably to the UK entity, reinforcing the platform-as-principal model

---

## 9. Post-Care Digital Subscriptions: Pure Tech Revenue {#9-post-care-digital-subscriptions}

### 9.1 Why Post-Care Is the Cleanest Revenue Stream

Post-care subscriptions are the **easiest revenue to defend as pure platform income** because:

- The service is **100% digital** — telemedicine, app-delivered content, AI coaching
- There is **no Mexican component** — the guest has left Mexico
- The service is delivered from **cloud servers hosted outside Mexico**
- The customer relationship is with the **UK platform entity**
- Payment is to the **UK platform entity**

**Mexico has no claim to tax this income.**

### 9.2 Expanding the Post-Care Model

Current projection: 36% uptake at $1,000/year → $139K Y1, $461K Y5

**Expanded post-care platform:**

| Tier | Monthly Fee | Annual | Features | Target Uptake |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Essential** | $79/mo | $948 | AI check-ins, community, basic protocols | 40% of graduates |
| **Premium** | $199/mo | $2,388 | + Monthly telemedicine, advanced AI coaching | 20% of graduates |
| **Platinum** | $499/mo | $5,988 | + Weekly sessions, VIP community, bio-optimization | 10% of graduates |
| **Clinical** | $999/mo | $11,988 | Full continuing care, psychiatrist access, custom protocols | 5% of graduates |

**Revised post-care revenue (Y5, 1,280 guests, cumulative subscriber base of ~2,500+):**

| Tier | Subscribers (cumul.) | Annual Revenue |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| Essential | ~1,000 | $948,000 |
| Premium | ~500 | $1,194,000 |
| Platinum | ~250 | $1,497,000 |
| Clinical | ~125 | $1,498,500 |
| **Total** | **~1,875** | **$5,137,500** |

This is 10x the current projection and **100% UK platform revenue at 10% tax rate.**

### 9.3 Tax Treatment

- **Mexican tax:** 0% — no Mexican source, no Mexican PE, no physical delivery in Mexico
- **UK tax:** 10% under Patent Box (AI coaching algorithms, digital health protocols are qualifying IP)
- **WHT:** 0% — these are B2C payments from global customers to a UK company
- **Net after UK tax:** ~$4.6M (Y5 expanded model)

## 10. Bio-Optimization Premium: App-Delivered Protocols {#10-bio-optimization-premium}

### 10.1 Redesigning Bio-Optimization as a Digital Product

The current bio-optimization premium (~$2,600/guest add-on, 30% upsell rate) combines physical testing with digital analysis. In the platform model, we can restructure this:

**Physical component (Mexican OpCo delivers):**
- Blood draws, specimen collection
- Wearable device fitting
- Physical tests

**Digital component (UK Platform delivers):**
- Genomic analysis and interpretation (AI)
- Personalized supplement/nutrition protocol generation
- Wearable data analysis and recommendations
- Ongoing optimization reports
- Custom biohacking protocols

**Split:** 20% physical (OpCo), 80% digital (Platform)

### 10.2 Revenue Impact

At Y5: $1,000,000 in bio-optimization premium
- Platform captures 80%: **$800,000** (taxed at 10% UK)
- OpCo delivers physical: **$200,000** (cost-plus margin in Mexico)

## 12. Transfer Pricing Defense Strategy {#12-transfer-pricing-defense}

### 12.1 The Transfer Pricing Study Requirements

Mexico requires comprehensive transfer pricing documentation under Articles 76(IX), 76(XII), and 179-180 of the Income Tax Law (LISR):

| Document | Requirement | Deadline |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Local File** (Annex 9 / DIM) | Detailed TP analysis of all related-party transactions | Annual filing with tax return |
| **Master File** | Group overview, IP ownership, financial arrangements | Filed annually |
| **Country-by-Country Report** (CbCR) | If group revenue >MXN $13B (~$650M) | Not required initially |
| **ISSIF** (Informative Declaration) | If revenue >MXN $842M (~$42M) or related-party transactions >MXN $100M (~$5M) | Annual |

### 12.2 Benchmarking Each Charge

| Intercompany Charge | TP Method | Comparable Set | Defensible Range |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Platform commission (15%) | CUP / TNMM | Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb (15-25%) | 10-25% |
| Technology royalty (5%) | CUP / Profit Split | Pharma IP licenses, medtech royalties | 3-10% |
| Brand license (3%) | CUP | Hotel franchise fees (Marriott, Hilton: 3-6%) | 2-6% |
| SaaS platform fee ($30K/mo) | CUP | Enterprise health-tech SaaS pricing | $15K-$60K/mo |
| Data analytics ($10K/mo) | CUP / Cost Plus | Health data analytics SaaS | $5K-$25K/mo |
| Training ($15K/mo) | Cost Plus | Clinical training programs | $10K-$30K/mo |
| Management fee (2%) | TNMM | Hotel management companies (3-5%) | 2-5% |
| Intercompany loan interest | CUP | Mexican market rates for similar risk | 8-12% |

### 12.3 The "Stacking Problem"

The biggest risk is not any individual charge — it's the **aggregate**. SAT may argue:

> "Each charge in isolation appears arm's length, but the combined extraction of 30-40% of revenue leaves the Mexican entity with returns below what comparable Mexican healthcare facilities earn."

**Defense strategy:**
1. **Functional analysis showing limited risk:** The Mexican OpCo bears no IP risk, no market risk, no pricing risk, no development risk
2. **Comparable analysis showing similar structures:** Reference global hotel chains (Marriott franchisees earn 8-15% operating margins) and contract healthcare providers
3. **Economic substance test:** Document that the UK entity genuinely performs the functions that justify these payments
4. **Benchmark the OpCo return (not just each charge):** If the Mexican OpCo's return on costs (8-12%) falls within the range of comparable limited-risk service providers, the structure should hold

### 12.4 Critical: UK Economic Substance

The entire structure collapses if the UK entity is a shell. For the platform-as-principal model to work:

**UK entity must have:**
- CTO or VP Engineering based in the UK (or directing operations from the UK)
- Core engineering team (minimum 3-5 developers) employed by or contracted to the UK entity
- Strategic decisions about the platform made in the UK
- Board meetings held in the UK
- Bank accounts and treasury management in the UK
- Server infrastructure contracted from the UK (AWS London, Azure UK South)
- IP registered and protected from the UK

**Cost estimate for UK substance: $500K-$1.5M/year** in staff and infrastructure. This is the "price of admission" for the structure — without it, nothing works.

## 13. SAT Risk Assessment: Where Mexico Will Push Back {#13-sat-risk-assessment}

### 13.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| SAT argues platform creates a PE in Mexico | Medium (40%) | High | Ensure no UK entity employees in Mexico; no fixed place of business; all platform operations outside Mexico |
| SAT challenges aggregate extraction rate | High (60%) | Medium | Robust TP study with stacked-charge benchmarking; show OpCo return is arm's length |
| SAT reclassifies platform commission as Mexican-source income | Medium (35%) | High | Guest contracts with UK entity; payment to UK; booking occurs on UK platform |
| SAT applies BEPS Action 7 (artificial PE avoidance) | Medium (30%) | High | Mexican OpCo must not have authority to conclude contracts on behalf of UK entity |
| SAT challenges villa tokenization as Mexican real estate disposition | High (50%) | Very High | The token must represent interest in a non-Mexican entity; requires careful legal structuring |
| WHT dispute on characterization of SaaS payments | Medium (40%) | Medium | Treaty analysis; ruling request; structure as business profits (Art. 7) |
| REFIPRE challenge if UK effective rate falls below 22.5% | Low (15%) | Very High | UK headline rate is 25%; Patent Box is an incentive, not a rate reduction for REFIPRE purposes (needs confirmation from counsel) |

### 13.2 The PE Risk in Detail

The biggest single risk is that SAT argues the Mexican OpCo creates a **permanent establishment** for the UK platform in Mexico under:

- **Mexico-UK Tax Treaty, Article 5**: A PE exists if there is a "fixed place of business" or a dependent agent who habitually concludes contracts
- **Mexico LISR Article 2**: Broader PE definition including where services are performed

**How to mitigate:**
1. **Mexican OpCo acts in its own name** — it contracts with local vendors, employees, and authorities as TE Ops Mexico, not as an agent of the UK platform
2. **Mexican OpCo does not conclude contracts on behalf of the UK entity** — the guest contract is between the guest and TE Platform Ltd (UK) directly
3. **Mexican OpCo staff are employees of the Mexican entity** — not seconded from or directed by the UK entity
4. **Platform decisions are made in the UK** — pricing, program design, marketing strategy
5. **No UK entity employees permanently in Mexico** — occasional visits for quality assurance are fine

### 13.3 The Nuclear Risk: Beneficial Ownership Challenge

Mexico could argue that the UK entity is not the "beneficial owner" of the royalty/service income under the treaty — that the real beneficial owner is the Panama PIF (0% tax jurisdiction) and therefore deny treaty benefits.

**Mitigation:**
- UK entity must have genuine economic substance (staff, office, decision-making)
- UK entity must not be a mere conduit (it retains and reinvests profits)
- Principal Purpose Test (PPT) under MLI must be passed — the UK entity's existence must have business purposes beyond tax avoidance

## 14. Blockchain & Crypto Architecture {#14-blockchain-crypto-architecture}

### 14.1 Villa Token Issuance

**Token Standard: ERC-3643 (T-REX Protocol)**

ERC-3643 is the leading standard for compliant security tokens. It includes:
- On-chain identity verification (KYC/AML)
- Transfer restrictions (only verified investors)
- Country-level compliance rules
- Forced transfers (for legal compliance)
- Recovery mechanisms

```

**Tax advantage:** Payment in crypto to a UK entity reinforces that the transaction occurs with the UK entity, not the Mexican OpCo. The Mexican OpCo receives a service delivery fee in MXN — it never touches crypto.

### 14.3 TE Ecosystem Token (Future - Year 3+)

A more ambitious play: create a **TE utility token** that powers the entire ecosystem:

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|------------|
| Guest credits | Prepaid treatment credits (purchased at discount) |
| Loyalty rewards | Earned through program completion, referrals |
| Villa rental payment | Token holders get preferred rates |
| Post-care subscription | Pay with tokens for discount |
| Community governance | Token-weighted voting on community decisions |
| Marketplace | Trade wellness products, supplements |

**Regulatory note:** Utility tokens (if properly structured) may not be securities. However, if they have investment characteristics (expectation of profit from others' efforts), they will be treated as securities under the Howey test (US), similar frameworks in UK, Mexico, Canada.

This is a **Year 3+ play** and requires dedicated regulatory counsel in each jurisdiction.

| Y1 | $10,748,000 | $139,000 | $16,000,000 | $26,887,000 | $1,026,200 | ~$4,200,000 | ~$3,174,000 |
| Y2 | $20,440,000 | $1,200,000 | $26,000,000 | $47,640,000 | $1,852,600 | ~$7,900,000 | ~$6,047,000 |
| Y3 | $27,426,000 | $2,500,000 | $32,000,000 | $61,926,000 | $2,345,400 | ~$10,300,000 | ~$7,955,000 |
| Y4 | $31,805,000 | $3,800,000 | $22,000,000 | $57,605,000 | $2,247,700 | ~$8,500,000 | ~$6,252,000 |
| Y5 | $35,461,000 | $5,137,500 | $0 | $40,598,500 | $2,353,450 | ~$5,600,000 | ~$3,247,000 |
| **5-Year** | **$125,880,000** | **$12,776,500** | **$96,000,000** | **$234,656,500** | **~$9,825,000** | **~$36,500,000** | **~$26,675,000** |

**Estimated 5-year tax savings: ~$26.7 million**

*(This is an approximation. Actual savings depend on transfer pricing outcomes, SAT audits, and structure implementation. The "All-Mexico" scenario assumes 30% on all taxable income. Real savings will likely be 50-70% of this estimate after compliance costs and structural limitations.)*

## 16. Critical Red Lines: What NOT to Do {#16-critical-red-lines}

### 16.1 Lines That Must Not Be Crossed

These actions would make the structure illegal or indefensible:

| Red Line | Why It's Fatal | What to Do Instead |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Mexican OpCo at literal zero profit** | No arm's length comparable earns 0% on substantial operations | Target 8-12% return on costs |
| **UK entity with no real employees** | Shell company = structure collapse | Hire 5+ UK-based staff, CTO in UK |
| **Fake invoices or inflated charges** | Tax fraud (criminal) | Every charge must be for real services at market rates |
| **Platform "collects" but money goes straight to Mexico** | Flow-through = conduit = disregarded | Platform must genuinely retain and manage funds |
| **Mexican staff directed by UK entity** | Creates PE for UK entity in Mexico | OpCo must independently manage day-to-day operations |
| **Tokens that are really just property deeds** | Tokenization wrapper disregarded by SAT | Token must represent interest in SPV, not direct property |
| **Transfer pricing without documentation** | Automatic adjustment + penalties (50-100%) | Robust annual TP study by Big 4 firm |
| **Back-dating the IP to UK entity** | Artificial; no economic substance at creation | Start developing IP in UK from day one; contract R&D model |
| **Claiming Patent Box without qualifying patents** | HMRC disallows; regular 25% rate applies | File patents/register copyrighted software properly |

### 16.2 The "Smell Test"

Ask these questions of any structure:

1. **Would you be comfortable explaining this to a SAT auditor?** If not, don't do it.
2. **Is there genuine substance behind each entity?** Real people, real offices, real functions.
3. **Does each intercompany charge map to a real service?** Not a label, but a deliverable.
4. **Would an independent company agree to these terms?** That's the arm's length standard.
5. **Does the Mexican OpCo's return look reasonable for what it does?** 8-12% on a complex healthcare operation is defensible. 0-2% is not.

## 18. Open Questions for Counsel {#18-open-questions-for-counsel}

### For Mexican Tax Counsel

1. **Will SAT accept the platform-as-principal characterization** for a healthcare business where the physical service is delivered in Mexico? What precedents exist?
2. **What is the maximum aggregate extraction rate** (stacked intercompany charges) that is defensible before SAT challenges the overall return to the Mexican OpCo?
3. **Does the platform collecting guest payments create a PE** for the UK entity in Mexico, or does the UK-Mexico treaty Article 5 protect against this?
4. **Will tokenized villa sales be treated as Mexican real estate dispositions** regardless of the token wrapper? What is the ISR treatment?
5. **Can SaaS fees be characterized as business profits (Article 7, 0% WHT)** rather than royalties (Article 12, 10% WHT) or technical services (25% WHT) under the Mexico-UK treaty?
6. **What is the REFIPRE treatment of UK Patent Box income** — does the effective rate of 10% trigger REFIPRE (non-deductibility + 40% WHT), or is the headline rate of 25% used?

### For UK Tax Counsel

7. **Does the platform model qualify for Patent Box** given that the physical service delivery occurs in Mexico? HMRC requires that the patented invention contributes to the income.
8. **What constitutes sufficient UK substance** for a technology company that contracts with global developers? Minimum employee count? Office requirement?
9. **Will HMRC accept that platform commission income (not just royalties) qualifies for Patent Box?** Or only the royalty component?
10. **Transfer pricing implications of the UK entity retaining 30%+ of revenue** while the value delivery involves Mexican staff?

### For Blockchain / Securities Counsel

11. **Can villa tokens be structured as non-securities** (pure utility) or will they inevitably be classified as securities in the US, UK, Mexico, and Canada?
12. **What exemptions are available for the token offering** (Reg D/Reg S in US, prospectus exemptions in UK/Mexico/Canada)?
13. **Does the GENIUS Act (US stablecoin regulation)** or MiCA (EU crypto regulation) affect the token structure?
14. **What are the AML/KYC requirements** for a UK entity issuing tokens that represent interests in Mexican real property?

### Strategic

15. **Is there a Mexico-UK advance pricing agreement (APA) available** to pre-agree the transfer pricing methodology with SAT?
16. **Would a Mexican tax ruling (consulta vinculante)** be advisable before implementing the structure?
17. **What is the total compliance cost** (UK + Mexico + blockchain) for maintaining this structure annually?
18. **At what revenue level does the structure become cost-effective** relative to simply paying 30% Mexican tax?

## Appendix A: Comparison of All Four Strategy Documents

| Document | Structure | Effective Tax Rate | Risk Level | Best For |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| **1. Corporate Structure Optimization** | Traditional holding company | 25-32% | Low | Conservative investors; clean structure |
| **2. Global Tax Optimization** | Panama PIF + Treaty routing | 15-20% (corporate), 0% (personal) | Medium | Maximum personal tax elimination |
| **3. Technology IP Offshore** | UK Patent Box licensing | 10% on IP income | Medium | Tech licensing to multiple locations |
| **4. Platform-as-Principal** (this doc) | App-centric; Mexico as contractor | 13-18% blended | Medium-High | Maximum revenue extraction from Mexico |

**Recommended approach:** Combine elements of Documents 2, 3, and 4:
- Panama PIF for ultimate ownership (Doc 2)
- UK Patent Box for all technology IP (Doc 3)
- Platform-as-principal for guest revenue routing (Doc 4)
- Conservative transfer pricing within defensible ranges
- Robust documentation and genuine UK substance

**Estimated blended effective tax rate with combined approach: 12-18%**
**vs. all-in-Mexico: 30%**
**5-year estimated savings: $15-25 million** (on healing center + villas combined)
