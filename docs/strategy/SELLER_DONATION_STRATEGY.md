## 1. Executive Summary

### The Situation

The seller invested approximately **$28M** building Rancho Paraiso Oasis. He is selling under personal duress (divorce) at **$11.9M** -- a potential loss of **$16M+**. He is financially secure, emotionally restless, and has openly expressed he **needs more purpose**. He is enthusiastic about what we are building.

### URGENT: 2026 Legislative Changes (OBBBA)

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)**, signed into law, introduces changes effective **tax year 2026** that impact charitable deductions:

- **New 0.5% AGI floor:** Charitable contributions are only deductible to the extent they **exceed 0.5% of AGI**. At $10M AGI, the first $50,000 is non-deductible.
- **Deduction benefit capped at 35%** (reduced from 37% top marginal rate) for top bracket taxpayers.
- **Pre-2026 carryforwards are exempt from the 0.5% floor** -- contributions made in 2025 that carry forward to 2026+ are NOT subject to the floor.

**This creates urgency to execute the donation as soon as possible.** If the seller donates in 2025, his carryforward deductions into 2026-2030 are exempt from the floor. If he waits until 2026, the floor applies from day one.

### The Insight

A man who built something with $28M of his own money and is about to walk away with $11.9M -- taking a $16M loss -- does not want to feel like he lost. He wants to feel like what he built became something extraordinary. And he wants to be part of it.

**Selling gives him cash and a loss. Donating gives him a legacy, a tax shield, equity in a $147M enterprise, and a reason to wake up in the morning.**

### The One-Term Offer

We present **one deal** -- the donation deal:

```
SELLER DONATES the property to a qualifying 501(c)(3)
   |
   v
Gets a charitable tax deduction of $15-28M (appraised FMV)
   |
   v
Tax savings of $5.6M to $10.4M+ (depending on AGI and appraisal)
   |
   v
SEPARATELY receives 15% equity in the Mexico operation (TE Ops Mexico + TE RE Mexico)
   |
   v
Joins the team as Founding Steward with advisory role
   |
   v
15% TE Mexico equity at Year 5 = $22,050,000
   |
   v
We can buy him out at Fair Market Value at any time
   |
   v
TOTAL VALUE: $28M-31M+ vs. $11.9M from a sale
```

### Why This Works

| Dimension | Selling for $11.9M | Donating + Equity |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cash received | $11.9M | $0 direct (but $5.6-10.4M in tax savings) |
| Capital loss | ~$16M (limited annual use) | Not applicable |
| Tax savings from loss | ~$3.8M (over many years) | $5.6-10.4M (over 6 years) |
| Equity in project | $0 | 15% TE Mexico = $22.05M at Year 5 |
| Buyout option | N/A | We can buy him out at FMV anytime |
| Purpose & involvement | None | Founding Steward, advisory board |
| Total 5-year value | ~$15.7M | **$28-31M+** |
| Emotional outcome | "I sold at a loss" | "I'm part of something that changes lives" |

---

## 2. The Seller's Reality

### 2.1 Financial Position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total investment in property | ~$28,000,000 |
| Current asking price | $11,900,000 |
| Implied loss on sale | ~$16,100,000 |
| Loss as % of investment | ~57.5% |
| Reason for sale | Divorce -- forced disposition |

### 2.2 What Selling at $11.9M Actually Looks Like

If the seller sells the property for $11.9M on the open market:

```
Sale Price:                          $11,900,000
Less: Adjusted Basis (~$28M)*:     -$28,000,000
                                    ────────────
Capital Loss:                       -$16,100,000

Tax Treatment of the Loss:
- Can offset capital gains:          Dollar for dollar (if he has gains)
- Excess vs. ordinary income:        $3,000/year maximum (!!)
- Carryforward:                      Indefinitely, but only $3K/year

Realistic Tax Savings from Loss:
- If he has $16M in future capital gains:  ~$3.8M saved (20% LTCG + 3.8% NIIT)
- If he has no capital gains:              $3,000/year x many decades
- Timeline to fully use:                   Could take 5,000+ years at $3K/year
```

*Note: Adjusted basis depends on depreciation taken. If he has taken depreciation deductions, basis is lower and the loss is smaller.*

**The brutal truth:** Selling gives him $11.9M in cash and a capital loss that is nearly worthless unless he has massive future capital gains to offset. The $16M loss sounds big on paper but its tax value is severely limited by IRC Section 1211.

### 2.3 What He Actually Needs

Based on his expressed desires and psychological profile:

| Need | How We Address It |
|------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Founding Steward of a healing center that changes lives |
| **Legacy** | His property becomes a world-class transformation destination |
| **Financial upside** | 15% equity in the Mexico operation ($22M+ at Year 5) |
| **Tax efficiency** | Charitable deduction worth $5.6-10.4M+ |
| **Community** | Part of a team, advisory board, annual visits |
| **Identity** | "I didn't sell at a loss. I donated to a cause that's changing the world." |
| **Story** | From divorce loss to philanthropic leader -- powerful personal narrative shift |

---

## 3. The $28M Question

### Can He Write Off the Full $28M He Invested?

**Short answer:** It depends entirely on the **Fair Market Value (FMV)** at the time of donation -- NOT his cost basis.

### How Charitable Deductions Work for Real Property (IRC 170)

The charitable deduction for donated real property is based on the property's **Fair Market Value** at the time of donation, determined by a **qualified independent appraisal**. The seller's original cost ($28M) is irrelevant to the deduction calculation.

```
Charitable Deduction = Fair Market Value at Time of Donation
                       (NOT cost basis, NOT asking price)
```

### Three Scenarios

| Scenario | Appraised FMV | Deduction | Tax Savings (37% + state) |
|----------|---------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Conservative** | $15,000,000 | $15,000,000 | ~$5,600,000 |
| **Moderate** | $20,000,000 | $20,000,000 | ~$7,500,000 |
| **Aggressive** | $28,000,000 | $28,000,000 | ~$10,400,000 |

### Why the Appraisal Could Be Higher Than $11.9M

The $11.9M asking price reflects a **distressed sale** -- divorce-driven, time-pressured, and marketed to a limited buyer pool. An independent appraisal uses three methods that could yield a very different number:

**1. Cost Approach (Replacement Cost)**
- What would it cost to rebuild this property today?
- If $28M was invested (construction, design, infrastructure, landscaping, furnishing), replacement cost minus physical depreciation could be $18-25M+
- Construction costs have risen significantly since the original build

**2. Income Approach**
- What income can this property generate?
- As a luxury wellness retreat: $10-20M+ annual revenue potential
- Cap rate analysis at 8-12% could yield values of $15-25M+

**3. Market Comparison**
- Comparable luxury properties in Tulum/Riviera Maya
- Limited direct comparables for properties of this scale and quality
- Recent sales of comparable estates in the region

**Key factors that support a higher-than-asking appraisal:**
- Forced sale discount typically 15-40% below FMV
- Divorce-driven sales are textbook distressed situations
- Limited marketing to appropriate buyer pool
- Unique property characteristics (cenotes, jungle, scale) = limited comparables
- Rising replacement costs in the region

### The Critical Caveat: IRS Scrutiny

The IRS **heavily scrutinizes** property donations where the appraised value significantly exceeds recent sale offers or listing prices. If the property is listed at $11.9M and donated at $28M, this is a **major red flag** that invites audit.

**IRS penalties for valuation overstatement (IRC 6662):**

| Overstatement Level | Penalty |
|---------------------|---------|
| 150% or more of correct value | 20% penalty on underpayment of tax (substantial valuation misstatement) |
| 200% or more of correct value | 40% penalty on underpayment of tax (gross valuation misstatement) |
| Charitable contribution overstatement (IRC 6662(b)(9)) | **50% penalty** on underpayment (enhanced penalty for charitable donations) |
| Fraudulent intent (IRC 6663) | **75% penalty** + criminal liability + no statute of limitations |

**Appraiser penalties (IRC 6695A):** The appraiser faces the greater of 10% of the underpayment attributable to the misstatement OR $1,000 per appraisal.

### Realistic Appraisal Range

Given the listing at $11.9M and the $28M cost basis, a defensible appraisal likely falls in the **$15M-$22M range**:

```
$11.9M asking price
  + Forced sale discount reversal (20-30%):    +$3M to $5M
  + Cost approach premium:                      +$2M to $5M
  + Income approach consideration:              +$1M to $3M
  - Market reality / depreciation:              -$2M to $4M
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  Defensible FMV Range:                         $15M to $22M
```

**Our recommendation:** Target an appraisal in the **$18-22M range** -- supported by the cost approach and income potential, adjusted for market conditions. This is defensible, material, and avoids the "doubling the asking price" red flag.

**To maximize the appraisal:**
1. Take the property OFF the market before donation
2. Allow time to pass (removes the distressed-sale pricing signal)
3. Engage a qualified appraiser experienced in luxury/resort properties
4. Emphasize the cost approach and income approach over market comparison
5. Document the unique characteristics that limit market comparisons

## 4. Deep Dive: Tax Write-Off Analysis

### 4.1 The Rules (IRC 170)

**For donation of appreciated real property held > 1 year to a public charity:**

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Deduction basis** | Fair Market Value (FMV) |
| **AGI limitation** | 30% of AGI per year (IRC 170(b)(1)(C)) |
| **Carryforward** | Excess deduction carries forward 5 years (total: 6 years to use) |
| **Appraisal required** | Qualified independent appraisal required for donations > $5,000 |
| **Form required** | Form 8283 (Noncash Charitable Contributions) |
| **Election option** | Donor may elect to use basis instead of FMV, which allows 50% AGI limit instead of 30% |

### 4.2 The 30% AGI Limitation -- Timeline of the Write-Off

The deduction is limited to **30% of the seller's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** per year. Unused amounts carry forward for 5 additional years.

**Example: Seller AGI = $5M/year, Donation FMV = $20M**

| Year | AGI | 30% Limit | Deduction Used | Remaining | Tax Saved (~37%) |
|------|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | $5,000,000 | $1,500,000 | $1,500,000 | $18,500,000 | $555,000 |
| Year 2 | $5,000,000 | $1,500,000 | $1,500,000 | $17,000,000 | $555,000 |
| Year 3 | $5,000,000 | $1,500,000 | $1,500,000 | $15,500,000 | $555,000 |
| Year 4 | $5,000,000 | $1,500,000 | $1,500,000 | $14,000,000 | $555,000 |
| Year 5 | $5,000,000 | $1,500,000 | $1,500,000 | $12,500,000 | $555,000 |
| Year 6 | $5,000,000 | $1,500,000 | $1,500,000 | $11,000,000 | $555,000 |
| **EXPIRED** | | | | **$11,000,000 LOST** | |
| **Total Used** | | | **$9,000,000** | | **$3,330,000** |

At $5M AGI, the seller only uses **$9M of the $20M deduction** and loses $11M. This is a significant waste.

**Example: Seller AGI = $10M/year, Donation FMV = $20M**

| Year | AGI | 30% Limit | Deduction Used | Remaining | Tax Saved (~37%) |
|------|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | $10,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $17,000,000 | $1,110,000 |
| Year 2 | $10,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $14,000,000 | $1,110,000 |
| Year 3 | $10,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $11,000,000 | $1,110,000 |
| Year 4 | $10,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $8,000,000 | $1,110,000 |
| Year 5 | $10,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $5,000,000 | $1,110,000 |
| Year 6 | $10,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $2,000,000 | $1,110,000 |
| **EXPIRED** | | | | **$2,000,000 LOST** | |
| **Total Used** | | | **$18,000,000** | | **$6,660,000** |

At $10M AGI, the seller uses $18M of the $20M deduction. Much better.

**Example: Seller AGI = $15M/year, Donation FMV = $20M**

| Year | AGI | 30% Limit | Deduction Used | Remaining | Tax Saved |
|------|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Year 1 | $15,000,000 | $4,500,000 | $4,500,000 | $15,500,000 | $1,665,000 |
| Year 2 | $15,000,000 | $4,500,000 | $4,500,000 | $11,000,000 | $1,665,000 |
| Year 3 | $15,000,000 | $4,500,000 | $4,500,000 | $6,500,000 | $1,665,000 |
| Year 4 | $15,000,000 | $4,500,000 | $4,500,000 | $2,000,000 | $1,665,000 |
| Year 5 | $15,000,000 | $4,500,000 | $2,000,000 | $0 | $740,000 |
| **Total Used** | | | **$20,000,000** | | **$7,400,000** |

At $15M AGI, the seller uses the **entire $20M deduction** in 5 years.

### 4.3 The Breakeven AGI for Full Utilization

To fully utilize the deduction over 6 years:

```
Required Annual AGI = Donation FMV / (30% x 6 years)
                    = Donation FMV / 1.80
```

| Donation FMV | Required AGI for Full Use | Tax Savings (37%) |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| $15,000,000 | $8,333,000/year | $5,550,000 |
| $18,000,000 | $10,000,000/year | $6,660,000 |
| $20,000,000 | $11,111,000/year | $7,400,000 |
| $22,000,000 | $12,222,000/year | $8,140,000 |
| $25,000,000 | $13,889,000/year | $9,250,000 |
| $28,000,000 | $15,556,000/year | $10,360,000 |

### 4.4 CRITICAL: 2026 OBBBA Impact on Deduction Value

Starting in 2026, the OBBBA introduces two changes that reduce the value of charitable deductions:

**Change 1: 0.5% AGI Floor**
Charitable deductions are only available for contributions exceeding 0.5% of AGI.

| Seller AGI | 0.5% Floor | Lost Deduction |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| $5,000,000 | $25,000 | Minimal impact |
| $10,000,000 | $50,000 | Moderate |
| $20,000,000 | $100,000 | Moderate |

**Change 2: Top Bracket Benefit Capped at 35%**
The tax savings per dollar of deduction drops from 37% to 35% for top-bracket taxpayers.

| Deduction Amount | Pre-2026 Savings (37%) | Post-2026 Savings (35%) | Difference |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|
| $20,000,000 | $7,400,000 | $7,000,000 | -$400,000 |
| $15,000,000 | $5,550,000 | $5,250,000 | -$300,000 |

**THE KEY INSIGHT: Pre-2026 carryforwards are exempt from the floor.** If the donation is made in 2025, the carryforward amounts used in 2026-2030 are NOT subject to the 0.5% AGI floor. This creates a **significant timing incentive** to execute the donation before December 31, 2025.

**However, we are currently in February 2026.** If the donation occurs in 2026, the floor applies but the impact is relatively small (0.5% of AGI). The 35% cap reduces savings by ~$200-400K on a $20M donation. Not a dealbreaker, but worth noting.

### 4.5 The Basis Election -- Does It Help? (IRC 170(b)(1)(C)(iii))

IRC 170(b)(1)(C)(iii) allows donors of **appreciated** capital gain property to **elect** to use basis instead of FMV, which raises the AGI limitation from 30% to 50%. This is designed for cases where a donor wants to deduct more per year (higher AGI limit) even at a lower total deduction.

**Does this help our seller?**

No. This election only applies to **appreciated property** (where FMV > basis). In the seller's case, the property has **depreciated** (FMV of $15-22M < basis of $28M). When FMV < basis, the deduction is already limited to FMV under IRC 170(e). The election to use basis doesn't apply because basis is *higher* than FMV -- there's no "reduction" happening.

**Bottom line: The deduction is capped at FMV regardless. The $28M cost basis cannot be deducted through a charitable donation when the property is worth less than $28M.**

This is why the **appraisal is the single most important element** of this strategy. Every dollar of defensible FMV above the $11.9M asking price translates directly into additional tax savings for the seller.

### 4.5 What About the Capital Loss?

**Critical insight:** When property is donated instead of sold, the **capital loss is permanently forfeited.**

If the seller sells for $11.9M:
- Realizes a capital loss of ~$16.1M
- Can offset future capital gains
- $3,000/year against ordinary income

If the seller donates:
- Gets a charitable deduction (= FMV)
- **Loses the capital loss entirely**
- The difference between cost and FMV evaporates -- no deduction for the loss portion

This means the donation must create **more tax value** than the combination of sale proceeds + capital loss tax savings. This is why the equity component is essential -- the donation deal only wins when you include the TE Mexico equity.

---

## 5. Strategy A: Full Donation to 501(c)(3) + TE Mexico Equity

### The Structure

This is the cleanest and most powerful structure. The seller donates the property outright to a qualifying 501(c)(3). Separately, the seller receives equity in the for-profit operating company.

```
SELLER donates property to 501(c)(3)
   |
   v
501(c)(3) owns the real estate
   |
   v
501(c)(3) leases property to OpCo at arm's length rent
   |
   v
OpCo operates the Transformational Epicenter
   |
   v
Seller receives 15% equity in TE Ops Mexico + TE RE Mexico (SEPARATE from donation)
   |
   v
Seller joins advisory board as Founding Steward
```

### 5.1 Tax Treatment -- The Donation

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Deduction** | Fair Market Value of property at time of donation |
| **Appraised FMV (target)** | $18,000,000 - $22,000,000 |
| **AGI limit** | 30% of AGI per year |
| **Carryforward** | 5 additional years (6 years total) |
| **Form required** | Form 8283, Section B (property > $5,000) |
| **Appraisal** | Qualified appraisal by certified appraiser, completed no earlier than 60 days before donation |
| **Capital loss** | Forfeited -- no capital loss recognition on donated property |

### 5.2 Tax Savings Calculation (Moderate Scenario: FMV = $20M)

**Assumptions:** Seller is US taxpayer, AGI ~$10M/year, federal rate 37%, state ~5%

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Charitable deduction | $20,000,000 |
| Annual deduction utilized (30% x $10M AGI) | $3,000,000/year |
| Years to fully utilize | ~6.7 years (but only 6 allowed) |
| Total deduction utilized over 6 years | $18,000,000 |
| Unused/expired | $2,000,000 |
| Federal tax savings (37%) | $6,660,000 |
| State tax savings (~5%) | $900,000 |
| **Total tax savings** | **~$7,560,000** |

### 5.3 The Equity Component -- Why It's Separate

**THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL LEGAL POINT IN THE ENTIRE STRATEGY.**

The seller's equity in TE Mexico must be **legally, temporally, and economically separate** from the donation. If the IRS determines the equity was a condition of the donation, two catastrophic things happen:

1. **Quid pro quo:** The charitable deduction is reduced by the FMV of the equity received
2. **Step transaction doctrine:** The IRS treats the donation + equity grant as a single transaction, potentially eliminating the deduction entirely

**How to protect this separation:**

| Protection | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **No written linkage** | The donation agreement must not reference the equity grant; the equity agreement must not reference the donation |
| **Temporal separation** | The donation and equity grant should occur at different times (ideally 30-90 days apart) |
| **Independent consideration** | The equity must be granted for genuine, documented reasons independent of the donation (advisory services, industry expertise, network, sweat equity) |
| **Separate negotiations** | Each agreement should be negotiated independently with separate counsel |
| **No binding commitment** | At the time of donation, there must be no binding commitment to grant equity |
| **Economic independence** | Each transaction must stand on its own economic merit |

### 5.4 The Equity Terms -- 15% TE Mexico

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Stake** | 15% non-controlling interest in TE Ops Mexico + TE RE Mexico (Mexico operation only) |
| **Justification** | Advisory services, industry expertise, property knowledge, network access, ongoing mentorship |
| **Voting rights** | Non-voting preferred units |
| **Vesting** | 4-year vest with 1-year cliff (protects founders if relationship sours) |
| **Distribution rights** | 15% of TE Mexico distributions after preferred return to any investors |
| **Transfer** | Subject to ROFR by founders |
| **Buyout** | Founders may purchase at FMV at any time after Year 1 (founders' option only) |
| **Tag-along** | Yes |
| **Anti-dilution** | Weighted average anti-dilution on future equity issuances |

### 5.5 TE Mexico Equity Value Projection

*Enterprise values below reflect the Mexico operation (TE Ops Mexico + TE RE Mexico) only.*

| Year | Mexico Enterprise Value | Seller's 15% | Basis |
|------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
| Year 1 | ~$29,000,000 | $4,350,000 | Post-money valuation |
| Year 2 | ~$55,000,000 | $8,250,000 | Revenue multiple |
| Year 3 | ~$87,000,000 | $13,050,000 | Revenue multiple |
| Year 4 | ~$110,000,000 | $16,500,000 | Revenue multiple |
| Year 5 | ~$147,000,000 | $22,050,000 | Sum-of-parts valuation |

### 5.6 Total Value to Seller (Strategy A)

| Component | Value | Timing |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Cash received | $0 | -- |
| Tax savings from donation (FMV $20M) | ~$7,560,000 | Years 1-6 |
| 15% TE Mexico equity value (Year 5) | $22,050,000 | Ongoing |
| Advisory compensation ($50K/year) | $250,000 | Years 1-5 |
| **Total 5-year value** | **~$29,860,000** | |

**Compared to selling for $11.9M: The donation deal is worth ~2.5x more.**

### 5.7 What the 501(c)(3) Gets

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Property valued at $18-22M | Asset for mission advancement |
| Lease income from OpCo | Annual revenue stream |
| Mission alignment | Healing and transformation center on its property |
| No purchase cost | Property acquired via donation at zero cost |

### 5.8 What the Founders Get

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Property at zero acquisition cost | No $10-12M raise needed for RE |
| 85% of TE Mexico | After 15% to seller (this location only) |
| Full voting control | Seller holds non-voting units |
| **100% of TE Holdings (Cayman)** | Global parent entity — entirely ours |
| **100% of all IP** | All IP stays in Cayman entity — untouched |
| **100% of future locations** | Any future sites — entirely ours |
| Seller as advocate | 15% owner of this location becomes the biggest champion |
| Buyout optionality | Can consolidate Mexico to 100% whenever we want at FMV |
| Reduced capital raise | Only need $5M for operations (not $15-17M) |

---

## 6. Strategy B: Bargain Sale + Partial Donation

### The Structure

A "bargain sale" means the seller sells the property to the 501(c)(3) at below FMV. The difference between FMV and the sale price is treated as a charitable donation. The seller gets some cash AND a tax deduction.

```
Property FMV (appraised):      $20,000,000
Seller sells to 501(c)(3) for: $ 5,000,000
                                ───────────
Charitable donation portion:    $15,000,000
```

### 6.1 The Tax Treatment (IRC 1011(b))

In a bargain sale, the seller must **allocate basis** between the sale portion and the donation portion:

```
Basis allocation formula:
  Basis allocated to sale = Total basis x (Sale price / FMV)
  Basis allocated to donation = Total basis x (Donation portion / FMV)

Example (Basis = $28M, FMV = $20M, Sale Price = $5M):
  Basis to sale = $28M x ($5M / $20M) = $7,000,000
  Basis to donation = $28M x ($15M / $20M) = $21,000,000

Capital gain on sale portion = $5M - $7M = -$2,000,000 (LOSS)
Charitable deduction = $15,000,000 (FMV of donated portion)
```

**Wait -- when FMV < basis, the math changes.**

When FMV is less than basis, the property is **not appreciated** -- it has depreciated. In this case:

- The charitable deduction for the donated portion = FMV of donated portion (not basis)
- The loss on the sale portion may or may not be recognized depending on structure

This creates a complex tax situation that requires professional modeling. The bargain sale adds a cash component but complicates the tax treatment.

### 6.2 Bargain Sale Economics

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sale price to 501(c)(3) | $5,000,000 |
| Charitable deduction (donation portion) | $15,000,000 |
| Tax savings on deduction (37% + state) | ~$5,600,000 |
| Cash from sale | $5,000,000 |
| **Total immediate economic benefit** | **~$10,600,000** |

Plus the same equity structure as Strategy A.

### 6.3 When to Use Strategy B

- If the seller **needs cash** and cannot accept $0 at close
- If the seller's AGI is too low to fully utilize a larger deduction
- If we want to reduce the "aggressiveness" of the structure

### 6.4 The Catch

The 501(c)(3) now needs **$5M to pay the seller** -- which means raising capital to fund the purchase. This partially defeats the purpose of the donation structure (reducing capital requirements).

---

## 7. Strategy C: Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)

### The Structure

A Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) is an irrevocable trust that:
1. Receives the property
2. Sells the property (tax-deferred -- no immediate capital gains)
3. Pays the seller an income stream for life or a term of years
4. Remainder goes to a charity (the 501(c)(3)) at the end

```
SELLER contributes property to CRT
   |
   v
CRT sells property (NO capital gains tax to seller or CRT)
   |
   v
CRT invests proceeds (~$12-20M)
   |
   v
Pays seller 5-8% annual distribution for 20 years (or life)
   |
   v
Remainder goes to 501(c)(3)
```

### 7.1 CRT Tax Benefits

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Capital gains deferral** | No immediate capital gains tax when CRT sells the property |
| **Partial charitable deduction** | Deduction = present value of the charity's remainder interest |
| **Income stream** | Seller receives annual income from the trust for life or term |
| **Asset protection** | Irrevocable trust removes property from seller's estate |

### 7.2 CRT Deduction Calculation

The deduction equals the present value of the charity's remainder interest, calculated using IRS tables (IRC 7520 rate). Typically 10-50% of the contributed property's FMV.

**Example: Property FMV = $20M, 6% unitrust payout, 20-year term**

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Property contributed | $20,000,000 |
| Annual payout rate | 6% |
| Term | 20 years |
| IRC 7520 rate (assumed) | ~5.0% |
| Present value of remainder | ~$5,000,000 - $7,000,000 |
| **Charitable deduction** | **~$5,000,000 - $7,000,000** |
| Annual income to seller | ~$1,200,000/year (initially) |
| Total income over 20 years | ~$24,000,000+ |

### 7.3 CRT Advantages

- Seller gets **income** (unlike Strategy A where he gets $0 cash)
- Capital gains are **deferred** (spread over the income distributions)
- Gets a **partial** charitable deduction
- Remainder benefits the 501(c)(3)
- Property is sold at market (the CRT sells it -- potentially to our RE entity)

### 7.4 CRT Disadvantages

- The property must be **sold** by the CRT (we need a buyer -- possibly our own entity)
- Deduction is **smaller** than Strategy A
- **Complexity** is highest of all three strategies
- Must be **debt-free** -- CRT cannot accept property with existing debt
- The CRT is irrevocable
- Self-dealing rules apply if seller is also trustee

### 7.5 When to Use Strategy C

- If the seller wants **income** rather than just equity
- If the property has existing debt that can be retired
- If the seller is uncomfortable with "getting nothing" from Strategy A
- If the seller's tax advisor is conservative and wants the most established structure

### The Pitch

> "You invested $28 million of your life into this property. You built something extraordinary. Right now, the market is offering you $12 million -- less than half of what you put in.
>
> We're not here to negotiate you down. We're here to show you how your $12 million property becomes $22 million -- while getting a multi-million dollar tax write-off, joining a team that's going to change thousands of lives, and being remembered as the man who made it all possible.
>
> The market values your property at $12 million. We value it at $22 million -- because we know what it's going to become. Your $22 million comes as 15% of everything we build at this location.
>
> This is not a sale. This is an evolution. Your property doesn't get flipped or bulldozed. It becomes the birthplace of a global healing movement. And you're not a former owner watching from the sidelines -- you're a founding partner with equity in everything we build.
>
> You told us you're looking for more purpose. We're offering you the most purposeful thing you could possibly do with this property. And the economics are better than any deal you'll ever see on a sale."

## 9. Sell vs. Donate: Side-by-Side Comparison

### The Full Picture

| Dimension | SELL at $11.9M | DONATE + Equity |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Day 1 Cash** | $11,900,000 | $0 |
| **Tax savings (Year 1-6)** | ~$3,800,000 (capital loss, IF future gains exist) | $6,000,000 - $8,000,000+ (charitable deduction) |
| **Tax mechanism** | Capital loss (limited to $3K/yr vs ordinary income) | Charitable deduction (reduces ordinary income) |
| **Equity in project** | $0 | 15% TE Mexico = $22.05M at Year 5 |
| **Buyout option** | N/A | We can buy him out at FMV anytime after Year 1 |
| **Advisory income** | $0 | $50,000/year |
| **Purpose & involvement** | Zero -- he's gone | Founding Steward, advisory board |
| **Legacy** | Property likely gets flipped/demolished | Property becomes a healing destination |
| **Total 5-year economic value** | ~$15,700,000 | ~$28,000,000 - $31,000,000+ |
| **Story** | "I sold at a 57% loss in my divorce" | "I donated my life's work to launch a global healing movement and I'm a founding partner" |
| **Emotional outcome** | Loss, grief, closure | Purpose, growth, evolution |

### The Tax Comparison

| Tax Element | Sell | Donate |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Capital gains | Loss of ~$16M (limited use) | No capital event |
| Charitable deduction | None | $18-22M (at 30% AGI/year) |
| Deduction quality | Capital loss (limited to $3K/yr vs ordinary; gains-only offset) | Ordinary income deduction (reduces top bracket) |
| Annual tax benefit | Variable (depends on future gains) | Predictable ($3-4.5M/year in deduction) |
| Timeline | Indefinite carryforward but $3K/year cap | 6-year window, fully predictable |
| State tax benefit | Varies | Varies (but applies to state income too) |

### The Bottom Line

**Selling is the rational choice if the seller:**
- Needs immediate cash
- Has no interest in the project
- Has massive capital gains to offset
- Doesn't itemize deductions
- Is not a US taxpayer

**Donating is the superior choice if the seller:**
- Has sufficient AGI to absorb the deduction
- Wants purpose and involvement
- Believes in the vision (he does)
- Values long-term equity over short-term cash
- Wants a powerful personal narrative
- Is a US taxpayer who itemizes

## 10. Equity Structure & Financial Modeling

### 10.1 Why 15% TE Mexico -- The Math

The seller's property is worth ~$12M on the open market. We value it at $22M through equity -- because we know what it's going to become. 15% of the Mexico operation's Year 5 value ($147M) = $22,050,000. Clean. Fair. Generous. Defensible. And scoped to this location only.

**Why 15% -- not 25% or 10%:**

```
His property (market value):          ~$12,000,000
We value it at:                       $22,000,000 (through equity)
15% of Mexico Year 5 value ($147M):  $22,050,000 ✓

Not 25% — because $36.75M overvalues a $12M property by 3x.
Not 10% — because $14.7M doesn't clear the market price by enough.
15% = $22M. Clean. Fair. Generous. Defensible. Mexico only.
```

**From the seller's perspective:**

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Property FMV (market) | ~$12,000,000 |
| Tax savings received | ~$7,500,000 |
| 15% of Mexico Year 5 enterprise value ($147M) | $22,050,000 |
| Return on market value | **83% gain in 5 years** |

**From the founders' perspective:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TE Mexico equity retained | 85% (minimum) |
| Value of 85% at Year 5 | $124,950,000 |
| Cost of seller's 15% | $0 cash |
| What 15% replaced | $10-12M capital raise for RE acquisition |
| Effective cost of equity | $0 (the donation IS the consideration) |
| Buyout optionality | Can consolidate Mexico to 100% at FMV anytime after Year 1 |
| **TE Holdings (Cayman)** | **100% ours — seller has zero interest** |
| **All IP & future locations** | **100% ours — seller has zero interest** |

### 10.2 RE Ownership -- The 501(c)(3) Structure

Since the property is donated to the 501(c)(3), the **nonprofit owns the real estate**. The seller cannot own equity in the nonprofit (nonprofits don't have equity owners). The RE equity component from prior strategies transforms into:

| Old Structure | New Structure |
|---------------|---------------|
| Seller owns 25% of RE entity | 501(c)(3) owns 100% of RE |
| Seller's RE equity | No RE equity -- replaced by 15% TE Mexico equity |
| RE value to seller | Captured through OpCo lease payments |

The 501(c)(3) leases the property to the OpCo at arm's length rent. The OpCo's operating margins already account for rent. The lease structure means:

- Nonprofit earns rental income (supports its mission)
- OpCo has a lease expense (standard business expense)
- Founders control the OpCo (which is where all the value is)
- Seller's 15% TE Mexico equity captures value from operations on the property
- Seller has ZERO interest in TE Holdings (Cayman parent), global IP, or future locations

### 10.3 The $5M Operations Capital

| Phase | Amount | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Deposit upon agreement | $100,000 | Founders / initial capital |
| Initial operational investment | $2,000,000 - $3,000,000 | Investors / founders |
| Additional to reach $5M operations | $2,000,000 - $3,000,000 | Investors |
| **Total operations capital** | **$5,000,000** | |

This $5M covers:
- Renovation & medical conversion: $1,000,000
- Medical + biohacking equipment: $1,000,000
- Working capital: $1,126,000
- Technology: $750,000
- Contingency: $847,500
- Pre-opening: $200,000

**This is dramatically less than the $15-17M previously needed** because the donation eliminates the $10-12M real estate acquisition cost.

### 10.4 Impact on Founder Dilution

| Without Donation | With Donation |
|------------------|---------------|
| Need to raise $15-17M | Need to raise $5M |
| Investors get 25-30% TE Mexico | Investors get 10-15% TE Mexico |
| Seller gets 0-10% | Seller gets 15% |
| Founders retain ~65-75% | Founders retain ~71-76% |

**Net effect:** Founders retain MORE ownership than the non-donation scenario because the 15% equity stake (Mexico only) eliminates the entire RE capital raise and its associated complexity, debt service, and investor management overhead. Plus we can buy the seller out at FMV anytime. The global parent (TE Holdings), all IP, and future locations remain 100% founder-controlled.

## 11. The Initiation -- The Ibogaine Experience

### The Strategy

Before presenting any numbers, before any negotiation, before any term sheet -- we bring the experience to him. The ibogaine healing journey on his own property is the most powerful sales tool imaginable.

### 11.1 Why This Works

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Experiential proof** | He feels the medicine. He doesn't just hear about it -- he lives it. |
| **On his property** | He experiences the transformation in rooms he built. The property becomes a vessel for healing before his eyes. |
| **Emotional opening** | Ibogaine opens the heart and dissolves ego defenses. Post-journey, he'll be in a state of clarity and purpose. |
| **Vision alignment** | After the experience, the pitch isn't theoretical -- he has a direct reference for what we're building. |
| **Bonding** | Sharing a healing journey creates deep trust and connection. |

### 11.2 The Sequence

```
PHASE 1: RELATIONSHIP (Weeks 1-3)
  Initial visit to property
  Deep conversation about his vision, his story, his needs
  Share our vision for the property (no numbers)
  Invite him to experience the medicine

PHASE 2: THE EXPERIENCE (Week 4)
  Bring medical team, facilitators, and medicine to his property
  Full ibogaine healing journey with integration support
  He experiences the Transformational Epicenter concept firsthand
  Allow 2-3 days for integration

PHASE 3: THE VISION (Week 5)
  Post-integration conversation
  Share the full vision in deeper detail
  Introduce the concept of the donation
  "What if this property could become what you just experienced?"

PHASE 4: THE OFFER (Week 6-7)
  Present the one-term offer
  Walk through the tax benefits
  Show the equity projections
  "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of something extraordinary"

PHASE 5: THE $100K DEPOSIT (Week 8)
  Upon verbal agreement, send $100K deposit
  Shows commitment and seriousness
  Begins the formal process
```

### 11.3 Talking Points Post-Experience

> "You just experienced what we want to bring to thousands of people in rooms you built with your own hands. Your property was designed for this -- even if you didn't know it at the time.
>
> You can sell this place for $12 million to someone who'll turn it into condos. Or you can become the founding father of a healing movement that will touch thousands of lives -- with your name on the wall, equity in everything we build, and a multi-million dollar tax benefit that dwarfs what you'd get from a sale.
>
> This isn't a transaction. This is your purpose."

---

## 12. The Card in the Back Pocket

### The 50% Profit Share Above Threshold

If the seller hesitates on the one-term offer, we have a sweetener:

**We offer him a 50% share of profits above a defined threshold.**

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Trigger** | TE Mexico EBITDA exceeds $[threshold] in any given year |
| **Share** | 50% of EBITDA above the threshold |
| **Duration** | 5 years from first operational year |
| **Cap** | $10,000,000 lifetime maximum |
| **Payment** | Annual, 60 days after audited financials |

### 12.1 Why This Works as a Sweetener

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Alignment** | He only earns more if the project succeeds enormously |
| **Psychology** | "50%" sounds huge -- it triggers excitement |
| **Reality** | The threshold ensures it only triggers in success scenarios |
| **Cap** | $10M cap means founders know the maximum cost |
| **Timing** | This is the card we play ONLY if he's on the fence |

### 12.2 Example: Threshold at $15M EBITDA

| Year | EBITDA | Above $15M | Seller's 50% | Cumulative |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Year 1 | $4.3M | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Year 2 | $10.9M | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Year 3 | $15.4M | $440,000 | $220,000 | $220,000 |
| Year 4 | $18.1M | $3,105,000 | $1,552,500 | $1,772,500 |
| Year 5 | $20.3M | $5,299,000 | $2,649,500 | $4,422,000 |

At a $15M threshold, the seller earns an additional ~$4.4M over 5 years. Combined with everything else, total package approaches **$35M+**.

### 12.3 When to Play This Card

- The seller says "I need more"
- The seller's advisor pushes back on the equity only structure
- The seller wants "guaranteed" upside beyond equity
- The seller needs something to tell his divorce attorney about the deal

**DO NOT present this upfront.** Start with the one-term offer. This is the closer.

## 13. Clawback & Protection Contingencies

### 13.1 Founder Protections

| Protection | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Equity vesting** | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff. If seller disengages early, unvested equity is forfeited. |
| **Non-compete** | Seller cannot support competing wellness facilities for 5 years |
| **Non-disparagement** | Mutual non-disparagement clause |
| **ROFR on equity** | Founders have right of first refusal if seller wants to sell equity |
| **Drag-along** | If founders sell 100%, seller must sell on same terms |
| **Non-voting** | Seller has zero governance authority |
| **Advisory termination** | Either party can terminate advisory role with 90 days notice |

### 13.2 Seller Protections

| Protection | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Tag-along** | If founders sell, seller participates on same terms |
| **Anti-dilution** | Weighted average anti-dilution on future equity issuances |
| **Information rights** | Quarterly financial summaries |
| **Annual property visit** | Contractual right to annual complimentary stay |
| **FMV buyout** | If founders want to buy out the 15% of TE Mexico, must be at fair market value |

### 13.3 Donation Clawback Scenarios

| Scenario | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|------------|
| IRS challenges the appraisal | Deduction reduced | Get top-tier qualified appraiser; keep within defensible range |
| IRS connects donation to equity (quid pro quo) | Deduction reduced by equity value | Strict temporal and documentary separation |
| 501(c)(3) loses tax-exempt status | Potential deduction reversal | Use established, well-managed 501(c)(3); proper governance |
| Seller dies before carryforward used | Unused deduction lost | Life insurance or CRT alternative if health is a concern |
| Property has undisclosed liens | Donation may fail | Full title search and clearance before donation |

---

## 14. 501(c)(3) vs. 508(c)(1)(A) -- Which Vehicle?

### The Options

Travis has a 501(c)(3). The founders also have the Church of the Living Light (508(c)(1)(A)). Either could potentially receive the donation.

### 14.1 Comparison

| Factor | Travis's 501(c)(3) | Church of the Living Light 508(c)(1)(A) |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Tax-exempt status** | Recognized by IRS (or pending) | Automatic exemption (no application needed) |
| **Donor deductibility** | Fully deductible | Deductible, but donor bears burden of proof if audited |
| **AGI limits (appreciated property)** | 30% | 30% (same as public charity) |
| **Form 990 requirement** | Yes (unless church) | No (church exemption) |
| **IRS audit protection** | Standard | Church Audit Procedures Act (higher barrier for IRS to audit) |
| **Mission alignment** | TBD (depends on mission) | Healing, transformation, consciousness -- strong alignment |
| **Donor confidence** | Higher (IRS-recognized status) | Lower (donor bears proof burden) |
| **Private benefit scrutiny** | Standard | Standard (churches still subject to these rules) |

### 14.2 Recommendation

**Use Travis's 501(c)(3)** if:
- It has recognized 501(c)(3) status (determination letter)
- Its mission is aligned with receiving and operating a healing center
- It has proper governance and board structure
- The seller's tax advisors will be more comfortable

**Use the 508(c)(1)(A) Church** if:
- The healing mission fits more naturally as a religious activity
- We want the Church Audit Procedures Act protection
- Travis's 501(c)(3) has mission alignment issues
- The church can demonstrate genuine religious purpose for the property

### 14.3 Important: Mission Alignment

The 501(c)(3) that receives the property must have a **mission that genuinely supports** owning and operating (or leasing) a healing center. If Travis's 501(c)(3) is a food bank, donating a Tulum healing resort to it will raise immediate red flags.

**The receiving entity must either:**
1. Already have a mission aligned with healing, wellness, or transformation
2. Amend its mission/articles to include this purpose (before the donation)
3. Be a newly formed 501(c)(3) with the right mission (but this takes time -- IRS processing is 3-12 months)

---

## 14B. Mexico-Specific Considerations -- What Changes

### The Core Question: Does the Property Being in Mexico Change the Tax Strategy?

**No -- the US charitable deduction works for foreign property.** Under IRC 170, a US taxpayer who donates property (regardless of location) to a **US domestic 501(c)(3)** can claim the deduction, provided the US charity exercises control and discretion over the donated property. The property does not need to be in the US.

**What stays the same:**
- Charitable deduction = FMV (same rules)
- 30% AGI limitation (same)
- 5-year carryforward (same)
- Qualified appraisal required (same -- but appraiser needs Mexico expertise)
- Quid pro quo rules (same)
- Step transaction risk (same)
- OBBBA 2026 changes (same)

**What is different or added:**

### 14B.1 The Fideicomiso Problem

Under Mexican law, foreigners cannot directly own real property within the **restricted zone** (50km from coastline, 100km from international borders). Tulum is in the restricted zone. The seller almost certainly holds the property through a **fideicomiso** -- a 50-year renewable bank trust where a Mexican bank holds legal title and the seller holds beneficial interest.

**What is actually being "donated":**
- NOT the property itself (the bank holds legal title)
- The seller's **beneficial interest** in the fideicomiso
- This is the economic equivalent of owning the property

**Key implications:**

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **What transfers** | The seller assigns his beneficial rights in the fideicomiso to the 501(c)(3) |
| **Bank trustee approval** | The Mexican bank trustee (e.g., Scotiabank, BBVA, Banorte) must consent to the beneficiary change |
| **Can a US nonprofit be a fideicomiso beneficiary?** | Yes -- but the nonprofit needs a Mexican RFC (tax ID) and may need to register with the Mexican Foreign Investment Registry |
| **New fideicomiso or assignment?** | Typically an assignment of existing fideicomiso is simpler; alternatively, a new fideicomiso with the 501(c)(3) as beneficiary |
| **Bank fees** | Assignment/modification fees from the trustee bank (~$5,000-$15,000 USD) |
| **50-year term** | If the fideicomiso term is approaching expiration, it must be renewed (routine but required) |

### 14B.2 Mexican Transfer Taxes & Costs

Transferring property (or fideicomiso beneficial interest) in Mexico triggers several costs:

| Tax/Cost | Rate | Estimated Amount | Who Pays |
|----------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **ISR (Income Tax) on alienation** | Up to 35% of gain (or ~3-5% of gross transaction value as optional flat rate) | Could be significant if there's a gain; may be zero if it's a donation at zero sale price | Seller (transferor) |
| **Acquisition Tax (ISAI)** | 2-4.5% of assessed/cadastral value (varies by state -- Quintana Roo) | $200,000 - $500,000+ | Buyer (501(c)(3)) |
| **Notary fees** | ~0.5-1.5% of transaction value | $100,000 - $200,000 | Split or negotiable |
| **Appraisal (Mexican cadastral)** | Fixed fee | $5,000 - $15,000 | Either party |
| **Fideicomiso modification** | Bank fee | $5,000 - $15,000 | Either party |
| **Certificate of no liens** | Fixed fee | ~$500 - $2,000 | Seller |

**Critical question: Is the donation taxable in Mexico?**

Mexico does not have the same charitable donation incentives as the US. A transfer of property -- even as a "donation" -- may be treated as an **alienation** subject to Mexican ISR (income tax). The Mexican tax treatment depends on:

1. Whether the transfer is classified as a sale (venta) or donation (donacion) under Mexican tax law
2. The cadastral/assessed value of the property
3. Whether the 501(c)(3) qualifies as a "donataria autorizada" (authorized donee) in Mexico -- most US nonprofits do NOT have this status
4. Whether the US-Mexico tax treaty provides any relief

**If Mexico treats this as a taxable alienation:**
- ISR could apply on the difference between the cadastral value and the seller's cost basis in Mexico
- Since the seller paid $28M and the cadastral value is likely lower, there may be **no Mexican gain** (and thus minimal or no ISR)
- But the optional flat-rate ISR (3-5% of gross value) may still apply depending on how the transfer is structured

**This requires Mexican tax counsel review.** The Mexican tax cost could be $0 or could be $200K-$1M+ depending on structure.

### 14B.3 The 501(c)(3) as Mexican Property Owner

Once the 501(c)(3) receives the property, it becomes the fideicomiso beneficiary. This creates ongoing obligations:

| Obligation | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Predial (property tax)** | Annual property tax to Quintana Roo municipality |
| **Mexican RFC** | The 501(c)(3) needs a Mexican tax ID number |
| **Foreign Investment Registry** | Must register with the National Foreign Investment Registry (RNIE) |
| **Annual fideicomiso fees** | Bank trustee charges ~$1,000-$3,000/year |
| **Mexican accounting** | May need Mexican tax filings if receiving rental income from the OpCo lease |
| **Withholding on rent** | If OpCo pays rent to the 501(c)(3), Mexico may withhold tax on the rental payments |

### 14B.4 The Appraisal Challenge -- Mexican Property

The US qualified appraisal requirements (USPAP) still apply, but appraising Mexican property adds complexity:

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market data** | Mexican real estate transaction data is less transparent than US data; fewer reliable comps |
| **Dual valuation** | Mexico uses cadastral values (often far below market); the US appraisal must reflect true FMV |
| **Appraiser qualifications** | Must meet US USPAP standards AND have expertise in Mexican luxury real estate -- a rare combination |
| **Currency** | Property transactions in Mexico may be in pesos or USD; appraisal should be in USD for US tax purposes |
| **IRS scrutiny** | Foreign property appraisals face **heightened IRS scrutiny** because the IRS has less ability to verify values independently |

**Recommendation:** Engage a US-based qualified appraiser with specific experience in Mexican resort/luxury real estate. Firms with cross-border experience (e.g., CBRE, JLL, Cushman & Wakefield with Latin America desks) are ideal.

### 14B.5 Net Impact on the Deal Economics

| Cost/Adjustment | Estimated Amount | Who Bears It |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Mexican transfer taxes (ISAI + notary) | $300,000 - $700,000 | Negotiate (ideally from ops budget) |
| Mexican ISR on transfer | $0 - $500,000 (depends on structure) | Seller |
| Fideicomiso modification fees | $10,000 - $20,000 | Split |
| Cross-border qualified appraisal | $15,000 - $50,000 | Founders |
| 501(c)(3) Mexican registration | $5,000 - $15,000 | Founders |
| **Total Mexico-specific costs** | **$330,000 - $1,285,000** | |

These costs are meaningful but do not change the fundamental economics. On a deal where the seller's total value is $28-31M+, even $1.3M in Mexican transaction costs is ~4%.

### 14B.6 Alternative: Donate to a Mexican Donataria Autorizada

Instead of donating to a US 501(c)(3), the seller could donate to a **Mexican donataria autorizada** (authorized donee organization). This would:

- Potentially avoid some Mexican transfer taxes
- Generate a **Mexican** tax deduction (not a US one)
- Only be beneficial if the seller has **Mexican-source income** to offset

**This is NOT recommended** unless the seller is a Mexican tax resident. For a US taxpayer, the US charitable deduction through a US 501(c)(3) is far more valuable.

## 15. Legal & Structural Risks

### 15.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **IRS challenges appraisal value** | Medium-High | Medium | Conservative appraisal ($18-22M, not $28M); top-tier appraiser; remove listing before donation |
| **IRS applies step transaction doctrine** | Medium | Very High | Strict separation of donation and equity grant; different dates, documents, counsel |
| **Quid pro quo determination** | Medium | Very High | No linkage in any document between donation and equity; genuine separate consideration for equity |
| **501(c)(3) private benefit challenge** | Medium | High | Arm's length lease terms; independent board approval; proper governance |
| **Seller's tax advisor rejects structure** | Medium | Medium | Present CRT or bargain sale alternatives; engage our own tax counsel to brief seller's advisor |
| **Property has existing debt** | Unknown | High | Must be debt-free for clean donation; debt must be paid off first |
| **Fideicomiso beneficiary transfer blocked** | Low-Medium | High | Engage bank trustee early; confirm assignment is permitted; alternative: create new fideicomiso |
| **Mexican transfer taxes exceed estimates** | Medium | Medium | Get Mexican tax counsel opinion before execution; budget $500K-$1M for Mexican-side costs |
| **Mexican ISR on alienation** | Medium | Medium | Structure as donation (donacion) not sale; seller may have no Mexican gain if basis > cadastral value |
| **Qualified appraiser not available for Mexican luxury property** | Low-Medium | Medium | Engage CBRE/JLL/Cushman Latin America desk; cross-border appraisal expertise |
| **501(c)(3) cannot qualify as fideicomiso beneficiary** | Low | High | Mexican counsel to confirm; alternative: 501(c)(3) creates Mexican subsidiary to hold fideicomiso |
| **Divorce court blocks donation** | Medium | Very High | Must have divorce court approval or demonstrate property is seller's to dispose of |
| **IRS valuation penalties** | Low-Medium | Medium | Keep appraisal within defensible range; penalties are 20-40% of tax underpayment from overvaluation |

### 15.2 Intermediate Sanctions (IRC 4958) -- If Structure Fails

If the IRS determines the seller received an "excess benefit" from the 501(c)(3) (e.g., the equity grant is deemed part of the donation transaction), these penalties apply:

| Tax | Rate | Who Pays |
|-----|------|----------|
| **Initial excise tax** | **25%** of excess benefit | The seller (disqualified person) |
| **Second-tier tax** (if not corrected) | **200%** of excess benefit | The seller |
| **Manager tax** | **10%** of excess benefit (max $20,000/transaction) | Organization manager who approved |

**Example:** If the IRS determines the seller received $7M in equity as a quid pro quo:
- Initial tax: $7M x 25% = $1,750,000
- If not corrected: $7M x 200% = $14,000,000 additional
- This is in addition to losing the charitable deduction

These penalties underscore why the donation and equity grant must be **bulletproof separate transactions**.

### 15.3 The Biggest Risks

**Risk #1: Step Transaction / Quid Pro Quo**

If the IRS determines the donation and equity grant are one transaction:
- Charitable deduction = FMV of property MINUS FMV of equity received
- If equity is worth $7M+ at grant, deduction drops from $20M to $13M
- Could be worse: IRS could deny the entire charitable deduction

**Mitigation:** This is the #1 risk and requires the best tax counsel available. The separation must be bulletproof.

**Risk #2: Appraisal Challenge**

The property is listed at $11.9M. Any appraisal significantly above this is an audit target.

**Mitigation:** Take off market. Wait 60-90 days. Get a qualified appraiser who can defend the cost approach and income approach. Target $18-22M -- defensible but not egregious.

**Risk #3: Divorce Court**

If the property is marital property, the donation may require court approval. A divorce judge may not approve donating a $20M asset when the spouse wants cash.

**Mitigation:** Confirm the property is the seller's to dispose of. If joint, negotiate the divorce settlement first.

## 17. Critical Follow-Up Questions

Before finalizing this strategy, we MUST answer these questions:

### About the Seller

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Is the seller a US taxpayer?** | If not, US charitable deduction rules don't apply. Entire strategy changes. |
| 2 | **What is his approximate AGI (annual income)?** | Determines how much deduction he can use per year (30% limit). Below $8.3M/year AGI on a $15M donation means he'll waste part of it. |
| 3 | **Does he have significant capital gains in the near future?** | If he has large capital gains to offset, selling might compete with donating. |
| 4 | **Is the property solely his? Or marital property?** | If marital, the divorce court must approve the donation. His spouse may object. |
| 5 | **Is there any debt/mortgage on the property?** | Must be debt-free for donation. CRT also cannot accept encumbered property. |
| 6 | **How long has he owned it?** | Must be held >1 year for FMV deduction. If <1 year, deduction = basis only. |
| 7 | **Has he taken depreciation deductions?** | Reduces adjusted basis, which affects the capital loss calculation for the sell scenario. |
| 8 | **What is his current tax filing status?** | Affects AGI limits and marginal rates. |

### About Travis's 501(c)(3)

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 9 | **What is the 501(c)(3)'s mission?** | Must align with owning/operating a healing center |
| 10 | **Does it have a current IRS determination letter?** | Needed for donor confidence and deduction certainty |
| 11 | **Is it a public charity or private foundation?** | Private foundation = 20% AGI limit (worse for seller) |
| 12 | **Who is on the board?** | Independent board needed; founders can't control both the nonprofit and the OpCo without conflict issues |
| 13 | **Has it received and managed large donations before?** | A $20M donation to a tiny nonprofit raises red flags |

### About the Property (Mexico-Specific)

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 14 | **Is the property held through a fideicomiso?** | Almost certainly yes (Tulum is restricted zone). We need to know which bank is the trustee and the fideicomiso terms. |
| 15 | **Which bank is the fideicomiso trustee?** | We need their cooperation to transfer beneficial interest. Some banks are easier than others. |
| 16 | **Are there any liens, mortgages, or encumbrances?** | Must be debt-free for clean donation. Any Mexican bank debt must be retired first. |
| 17 | **What is the cadastral (assessed) value?** | Mexican transfer taxes are often based on cadastral value, which may be much lower than market value. |
| 18 | **Is there a Mexican corporate entity involved?** | Some properties are held through a Mexican S.A. de C.V. or S. de R.L. de C.V. that holds the fideicomiso. This changes what is actually donated. |
| 19 | **What is the property's current zoning?** | Affects appraisal methodology and future use potential. |
| 20 | **Is the property currently generating income (rentals, events, etc.)?** | Income approach to appraisal depends on this. Active income = higher defensible FMV. |
| 21 | **What is the ejido status of the land?** | Some Tulum-area properties have unresolved ejido (communal land) issues. Must have clean title. |

### About the Structure

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 22 | **Can the 501(c)(3) be named as fideicomiso beneficiary?** | Need Mexican counsel to confirm. Alternative: 501(c)(3) creates a Mexican subsidiary. |
| 23 | **What is the optimal timing for taking the property off market?** | Need to remove the $11.9M listing before appraisal to avoid IRS using it as FMV evidence. |
| 24 | **Who are the best US-qualified appraisers for Mexican luxury property?** | Need USPAP-compliant appraiser with Latin America experience. CBRE, JLL, Cushman are starting points. |
| 25 | **Has the seller filed Mexican tax returns on this property?** | Need to understand his Mexican tax position and basis in Mexico. |
| 26 | **What Mexican transfer costs should we budget?** | Need Mexican counsel to estimate ISAI, notary, ISR, and fideicomiso fees for this specific transaction. |

---

## Summary: The Three Strategies at a Glance

| | Strategy A: Full Donation | Strategy B: Bargain Sale | Strategy C: CRT |
|---|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Cash to seller** | $0 | $5,000,000 | $1.2M/year stream |
| **Charitable deduction** | $18-22M (full FMV) | $15M (partial) | $5-7M (remainder value) |
| **Tax savings** | $6-8M+ | $5.6M | $2-2.6M |
| **Equity** | 15% TE Mexico ($22.05M at Yr 5) | 15% TE Mexico ($22.05M at Yr 5) | 15% TE Mexico ($22.05M at Yr 5) |
| **Buyout** | FMV anytime after Year 1 | FMV anytime after Year 1 | FMV anytime after Year 1 |
| **Complexity** | Medium | High | Highest |
| **IRS risk** | Medium (appraisal + step transaction) | Medium | Low-Medium |
| **Total 5-year value** | $28-31M+ | $28-30M+ | $24-27M+ |
| **Best for seller who...** | Believes in the mission, has AGI to absorb deduction | Needs some cash now | Wants income stream + tax benefit |
| **Our recommendation** | **YES** | If seller needs cash | If seller/advisor is conservative |

---

## The Bottom Line

**This is the deal we want to present:**

1. He donates the property to a 501(c)(3)
2. He gets a $6-8M+ tax write-off (over 6 years)
3. He gets 15% of the Mexico operation -- worth $22M at Year 5
4. He gets a title, a role, and a reason to wake up
5. We can buy him out at Fair Market Value anytime after Year 1
6. His property becomes something that changes thousands of lives
7. His total economic value is **$28-31M+** vs. **$11.9M from a sale**

The donation deal isn't just better than selling. It's in a completely different universe. **He gets 2x+ the total value, a purpose, a legacy, and a front-row seat to watch his property change the world.** And the equity is the engine -- his $12M property becomes $22M, plus the tax savings on top.

## 18. Scenario Modeling: Best Case vs. Worst Case

### 18.1 All 26 Questions -- Answered for Both Scenarios

| # | Question | BEST CASE Answer | WORST CASE Answer |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | US taxpayer? | **Yes.** US citizen/resident, files US returns, itemizes deductions. | **Yes, but barely.** US citizen living abroad with complex multi-jurisdiction filing. Low US-source income. |
| 2 | Approximate AGI? | **$15M+/year.** High earner with investments, businesses, passive income. Can absorb full deduction in ~5 years. | **$3M/year.** Modest income post-divorce. Most wealth is in illiquid assets. Can only use $900K/year of deduction. |
| 3 | Future capital gains? | **No significant gains on the horizon.** No major asset sales planned. Donation clearly beats selling. | **$10M+ in capital gains** coming from other divorce-related asset sales in the next 2-3 years. Selling the property and using the capital loss to offset those gains becomes competitive. |
| 4 | Solely his property? | **100% his.** Property is his separate asset, not community property. Divorce court has no claim. He can donate freely. | **Marital property.** Divorce court considers it a marital asset. Spouse's attorney insists it be sold for cash to split proceeds. Donation requires court approval that may not come. |
| 5 | Debt on property? | **Zero.** Property is fully owned, no mortgage, no liens, no encumbrances. Clean for donation. | **$4M mortgage** with a Mexican bank secured by the fideicomiso. Must be paid off before donation. Who pays the $4M? |
| 6 | How long owned? | **8+ years.** Long-term capital gain property. Full FMV deduction available. | **8+ years.** Same -- this is not likely an issue either way. |
| 7 | Depreciation taken? | **No depreciation claimed.** Full $28M basis intact. (Property used personally, not as rental/business.) | **Depreciation taken.** If used as a rental or business, basis may be reduced to $20-22M. Reduces the capital loss value in a sell scenario. |
| 8 | Tax filing status? | **Single or Head of Household** post-divorce. Top marginal bracket (37%). | **Married filing separately** during divorce proceedings. Some deduction limitations apply. Lower effective benefit per dollar of deduction. |
| 9 | 501(c)(3) mission? | **Perfectly aligned.** Travis's 501(c)(3) is focused on healing, wellness, spiritual development, or community health. Receiving a healing center property is core to its mission. | **Misaligned.** Travis's 501(c)(3) is focused on education, youth sports, or food security -- not healing centers. Would need to amend articles or form a new entity (3-12 month IRS processing delay). |
| 10 | IRS determination letter? | **Yes.** Current, valid 501(c)(3) determination letter on file. Listed in IRS TEOS database. | **No determination letter.** Relies on 508(c)(1)(A) automatic exemption (if church) or application is pending. Donor bears burden of proof if audited. |
| 11 | Public charity or private foundation? | **Public charity.** 30% AGI limit for appreciated property. Best case for seller. | **Private foundation.** 20% AGI limit -- seller can only deduct 20% of AGI per year. At $3M AGI, that's only $600K/year. On a $15M donation, it would take 25 years to use -- but only 6 are allowed. He'd waste most of the deduction. |
| 12 | Board composition? | **Independent board.** 5+ members, majority unrelated to founders. Proper governance. No conflict issues. | **Founder-controlled board.** Travis and partners are the entire board. IRS sees this as a red flag for private benefit and self-dealing. |
| 13 | Experience with large donations? | **Yes.** Has received six-figure+ donations before. Has accounting systems, legal counsel, and proper procedures. | **Never received anything over $10K.** A $20M property donation to a tiny nonprofit with no track record is an IRS audit magnet. |
| 14 | Fideicomiso? | **Yes, clean fideicomiso** with a cooperative major bank. 40+ years remaining on the 50-year term. Clear beneficiary assignment provisions. | **Yes, but complicated.** The fideicomiso has 8 years remaining and needs renewal. The bank is bureaucratic. Assignment provisions are unclear. |
| 15 | Which bank? | **BBVA or Scotiabank** -- large, experienced with foreigner-held fideicomisos, cooperative on beneficiary changes. | **Small regional bank** that has never processed a beneficiary change to a foreign nonprofit. 6-12 month delay expected. |
| 16 | Liens/encumbrances? | **None.** Clean title, no liens, no judgments, no pending claims. | **Tax lien** from unpaid predial (property tax). Construction liens from contractors. Must be resolved before donation. |
| 17 | Cadastral value? | **Low cadastral value** ($3-5M range). Mexican transfer taxes based on this = lower costs. | **High cadastral value** ($8-10M). Higher Mexican transfer taxes. |
| 18 | Mexican corporate entity? | **No.** Direct fideicomiso held by the seller individually. Simple transfer. | **Yes.** Property is held by a Mexican S.A. de C.V. that the seller controls. Need to either donate the shares of the company or extract the property first. Adds complexity, potential Mexican tax events, and cost. |
| 19 | Zoning? | **Compatible with wellness/retreat use.** Turístico or mixto zoning. No change of use required. | **Residential only.** Requires zoning change application to Quintana Roo municipality. 6-12 months. Could be denied. |
| 20 | Generating income? | **Yes.** Property is actively rented for events, retreats, or vacation rental. $500K-$1M/year in documented income. Supports higher income-approach appraisal. | **No.** Property has been vacant/personal use only. No income history. Income approach to appraisal is weak. |
| 21 | Ejido status? | **Clean.** Land was properly detitularized from ejido decades ago. Full private title. | **Unresolved ejido claim.** A neighboring ejido disputes a portion of the boundary. Title insurance won't cover it. Donation cannot proceed until resolved. |
| 22 | 501(c)(3) as beneficiary? | **Yes, confirmed.** Mexican counsel has confirmed a US nonprofit can be named as fideicomiso beneficiary with proper RFC registration. | **Requires Mexican subsidiary.** Mexican law or the specific bank requires a Mexican entity as beneficiary. The 501(c)(3) must form a Mexican AC (asociación civil) to hold the fideicomiso. Adds 2-3 months and ~$15-25K in costs. |
| 23 | Property off market? | **Already taken off market** 90+ days before appraisal. The $11.9M listing is history. No active comps at that price. | **Still actively listed at $11.9M** with recent showings and offers. The IRS will point to this as FMV evidence. Appraisal above $14-15M becomes very hard to defend. |
| 24 | Qualified appraiser? | **CBRE Latin America desk** engaged. USPAP-compliant, experienced in Mexican luxury resort properties. Will use cost + income approach to support $20-25M FMV. | **Local Mexican appraiser** only. Does not meet US USPAP requirements. Must find and engage a US-qualified appraiser with Mexican experience -- limited options, 2-3 month lead time. |
| 25 | Mexican tax filings? | **Current.** Seller has filed all Mexican tax obligations. No outstanding liabilities. Mexican basis is established. | **Not filed or delinquent.** Seller has not been filing Mexican tax returns. Potential back-tax liability. Must be regularized before transfer or risk complications. |
| 26 | Mexican transfer costs? | **~$330K total.** Low cadastral value, no ISR gain, minimal notary/fideicomiso fees. | **~$1.2M total.** High cadastral value, potential ISR liability, complex notary proceedings, fideicomiso restructuring fees. |

#### The Financial Picture

**Charitable Deduction & Tax Savings**

| Year | AGI | 30% Limit | Deduction Used | Remaining | Federal Tax Saved (37%) | State Tax Saved (~5%) |
|------|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|

### 18.3 WORST CASE: The Challenging Scenario

#### Assumptions

```
Seller:          US taxpayer, $3M AGI, married filing separately during divorce
                 $10M in capital gains coming from other divorce asset sales
Property:        Marital property -- divorce court must approve
                 $4M mortgage (must be paid off before donation)
                 Owned 8+ years, some depreciation taken (basis ~$22M)
                 Vacant -- no income history
                 Zoning: residential only (needs change of use)
Fideicomiso:     Small regional bank, 8 years remaining, assignment unclear
                 High cadastral value ($8M)
501(c)(3):       Travis's entity is a small private foundation
                 No determination letter (relies on 508(c)(1)(A) if church)
                 Misaligned mission -- needs amendment or new entity
                 Board is founder-controlled
                 Has never received a large donation
Appraisal:       Hard to find USPAP-qualified appraiser with Mexican experience
                 Property still listed at $11.9M (not removed)
                 Cost approach: $20M
                 Income approach: $10M (no income history)
                 Market approach: $12M (close to listing price)
                 RECONCILED FMV: $14,000,000 (conservative, listing price weighs heavily)
Mexican costs:   ~$1,200,000
Debt payoff:     $4,000,000 (from who?)
```

#### The Financial Picture -- Worst Case

**Problem 1: The AGI Limit Crushes the Deduction**

At $3M AGI with a **private foundation** (20% AGI limit):

| Year | AGI | 20% Limit | Deduction Used | Remaining | Tax Saved (35%*) |
|------|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | $3,000,000 | $600,000 | $600,000 | $13,400,000 | $210,000 |
| Year 2 | $3,000,000 | $600,000 | $600,000 | $12,800,000 | $210,000 |
| Year 3 | $3,000,000 | $600,000 | $600,000 | $12,200,000 | $210,000 |
| Year 4 | $3,000,000 | $600,000 | $600,000 | $11,600,000 | $210,000 |
| Year 5 | $3,000,000 | $600,000 | $600,000 | $11,000,000 | $210,000 |
| Year 6 | $3,000,000 | $600,000 | $600,000 | $10,400,000 | $210,000 |
| **EXPIRED** | | | | **$10,400,000 LOST** | |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$3,600,000** | | **$1,260,000** |

*35% rate due to MFS limitations and 2026 OBBBA cap*

**He only uses $3.6M of a $14M deduction.** $10.4M (74%) is wasted. Tax savings: just $1.26M.

**Problem 2: Selling + Capital Loss Offset Might Be Better**

The seller has $10M in capital gains coming from other divorce sales:

```
SELL THE PROPERTY:
  Sale price:                    $11,900,000
  Adjusted basis (~$22M):       -$22,000,000
  Capital loss:                  -$10,100,000

  Apply loss against $10M capital gains:
    Tax saved: $10M x 23.8% (20% LTCG + 3.8% NIIT) = $2,380,000

  Remaining loss ($100K):
    $3,000/year against ordinary income = ~$33 years to use

  TOTAL FROM SELLING:
    Cash:                        $11,900,000
    Tax savings from loss:       $2,380,000
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    TOTAL:                       $14,280,000
```

**Problem 3: The $4M Mortgage**

The property has a $4M mortgage. This must be paid off before donation. Options:

| Option | Who Pays | Problem |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Seller pays it off from other assets | Seller | He needs $4M in cash he may not have (divorce) |
| We pay it off | Founders | Increases our capital requirements by $4M |
| 501(c)(3) assumes it | 501(c)(3) | Creates a bargain sale event; debt on donated property = deemed sale proceeds. Seller recognizes gain. |
| Refinance + pay off | Seller | Takes time; lender may not cooperate during divorce |

If the 501(c)(3) assumes the $4M mortgage, the IRS treats it as if the seller received $4M in proceeds. This triggers:
- Basis allocation (bargain sale rules)
- Potential capital gain recognition
- Reduced charitable deduction ($14M FMV - $4M deemed proceeds = $10M deduction)

**Problem 4: Divorce Court Approval**

If the property is marital, the divorce court must approve the donation. The opposing spouse's attorney will argue:
- "Why should our client lose $11.9M in sale proceeds so your client can get a tax deduction and some equity in a startup?"
- "The equity in this wellness company is speculative. Our client wants cash."
- Court may order the property sold for cash and proceeds split.

**Problem 5: The Entity Issues**

- Private foundation = 20% AGI limit (devastating at low AGI)
- No determination letter = donor bears proof burden if audited
- Misaligned mission = IRS could challenge the donation
- Founder-controlled board = private benefit/inurement risk
- No track record = audit risk

**Solution path:** Form a NEW 501(c)(3) public charity with aligned mission. But IRS processing takes **3-12 months**. Delays the entire deal.

#### Worst Case -- Adjusted Strategy

Given these problems, the best move in the worst case is a **hybrid approach**:

**Step 1: Address the blockers first**

| Blocker | Solution | Timeline | Cost |
|---------|----------|----------|------|
| $4M mortgage | Seller pays off from divorce assets (negotiate this into divorce settlement) | 1-3 months | $4M (seller) |
| Divorce court | Negotiate donation as part of divorce settlement; show the equity value to the court | 2-6 months | Legal fees |
| Entity issues | Form a NEW 501(c)(3) public charity with healing/wellness mission | 3-12 months | $5K-$15K |
| Listing price | Take off market immediately | 1 day | $0 |
| Appraiser | Engage CBRE/JLL LatAm now (lead time) | 2-3 months | $25K-$50K |

**Step 2: Use a Bargain Sale instead of full donation**

Since the seller needs some cash (divorce, $4M mortgage payoff), a bargain sale works better:

```
Property FMV (appraised):       $14,000,000
Seller sells to 501(c)(3) for:  $ 4,000,000  (covers mortgage payoff)
Charitable donation portion:     $10,000,000

Basis allocation:
  Basis to sale: $22M x ($4M/$14M) = $6,286,000
  Gain on sale: $4M - $6.286M = -$2,286,000 (LOSS -- no gain)

Charitable deduction: $10,000,000
```

BUT -- at $3M AGI and 20% private foundation limit, he can only use $600K/year (if private foundation).

**If we form a public charity instead: 30% AGI limit = $900K/year.**

| Year | Deduction Used | Tax Saved (35%) |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | $900,000 | $315,000 |
| Year 2 | $900,000 | $315,000 |
| Year 3 | $900,000 | $315,000 |
| Year 4 | $900,000 | $315,000 |
| Year 5 | $900,000 | $315,000 |
| Year 6 | $900,000 | $315,000 |
| **TOTAL USED** | **$5,400,000** | **$1,890,000** |
| **WASTED** | **$4,600,000** | |

**Plus** the $2.286M capital loss from the bargain sale portion can offset his $10M in other capital gains:

```
Capital loss from bargain sale:     $2,286,000
Tax savings (23.8% LTCG + NIIT):   $544,000
```

**Worst Case Total Package**

| Component | Value | When |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Cash from bargain sale | **$4,000,000** | Day 1 (covers mortgage) |
| Net cash after mortgage payoff | **$0** | -- |
| Tax savings from deduction | **$1,890,000** | Years 1-6 |
| Tax savings from capital loss | **$544,000** | Year 1-2 |
| 15% TE Mexico equity (Year 5 FMV) | **$22,050,000** | Ongoing |
| Advisory compensation | **$250,000** | Years 1-5 |
| Less: Mexican transfer costs | **-$1,200,000** | Day 1 |
| Less: Mortgage payoff (if we fund) | **$0** (seller covers from divorce) | |
| **TOTAL 5-YEAR VALUE** | **$23,534,000** | |

**vs. selling for $11.9M + capital loss savings of $2.38M = ~$14.28M**

### 18.4 DEAL-BREAKER Scenarios -- When to Walk Away from Donation

The donation strategy **does not work** if any of these are true:

| Deal-Breaker | Why | Pivot To |
|-------------|-----|----------|
| **Seller is NOT a US taxpayer** | No US charitable deduction available. Entire tax benefit disappears. | Original seller strategies (Options A/B/C from SIMPLE_SELLER_STRATEGIES). Focus on seller financing + equity. |
| **Seller does not itemize deductions** | Standard deduction ($14,600 single in 2026) means he gets zero benefit from the charitable contribution. | Same -- revert to original strategies. |
| **Divorce court blocks the donation** | If the court won't approve it, it can't happen. | Negotiate with both spouses; offer the spouse a separate economic interest. Or revert to purchase deal. |
| **Property has $8M+ in debt** | Debt payoff requirement makes the economics collapse. The 501(c)(3) assuming debt creates taxable events that undermine the deduction. | Pay down debt to manageable level first, then donate. Or revert to original strategies. |
| **Seller's AGI is under $1M/year** | Even at 30% limit, he can only use $300K/year x 6 years = $1.8M of deduction. On a $14-22M donation, he wastes 87-92%. Tax savings: ~$630K. Not worth the complexity. | Revert to original strategies. The donation tax benefit is too small to justify. |
| **No aligned 501(c)(3) and unwilling to wait** | If no entity exists and the seller won't wait 3-12 months for a new one, the donation can't happen now. | Start the entity formation NOW and do the donation later. In the meantime, use an option agreement or LOI. |

---

### 18.5 Side-by-Side: Best vs. Worst vs. Selling

| Metric | SELL ($11.9M) | DONATE (Worst Case) | DONATE (Best Case) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Cash received** | $11,900,000 | $0 (net after mortgage) | $0 |
| **Tax savings** | $2,380,000 | $2,434,000 | $9,240,000 |
| **15% TE Mexico equity (Yr 5)** | $0 | $22,050,000 | $22,050,000 |
| **Advisory comp** | $0 | $250,000 | $250,000 |
| **Mexican costs** | ~$300,000 | -$1,200,000 | -$330,000 |
| **Total 5-year value** | **$13,980,000** | **$23,534,000** | **$31,210,000** |
| **vs. selling** | baseline | **+$9.6M (+68%)** | **+$17.2M (+123%)** |
| **Deduction efficiency** | N/A | 54% (46% wasted) | 100% (zero waste) |
| **Buyout option** | N/A | FMV anytime after Year 1 | FMV anytime after Year 1 |
| **IRS audit risk** | None | Medium-High | Low-Medium |
| **Timeline** | 2-3 months | 8-14 months | 4-5 months |
| **Complexity** | Low | Very High | Medium |
| **Purpose/legacy** | None | Full | Full |
| **Story** | "Sold at a loss" | "Donated, but it was complicated" | "Donated. Changed the world." |

### 18.6 The Takeaway

**Even in the worst case, the donation deal is worth $9.5M+ more than selling.** The equity in TE Mexico is the engine. Whether the tax savings are $1.9M or $9.2M, the 15% TE Mexico equity at $22.05M is what makes this deal work -- his $12M property becomes $22M, an 83% gain on market value. And it's scoped to this location only -- the global parent, all IP, and future locations remain 100% ours.

The tax deduction is the cherry on top. The equity is the cake. And the buyout clause gives us the optionality to consolidate to 100% whenever we're ready.

**The key variables that actually matter (in order):**

1. **Is the seller a US taxpayer?** (If no = deal-breaker for donation strategy; pivot to property-for-equity deal)
2. **Is the property solely his?** (If marital = biggest practical obstacle)
3. **Is there debt on the property?** (If yes = must be resolved first)
4. **What is his AGI?** (Determines deduction efficiency: wasted vs. fully used)
5. **Can we get a good appraisal?** (Determines deduction size: $14M vs. $22M)

Everything else is solvable with money and time. And if the donation mechanics don't work at all, the property-for-equity deal (see SIMPLE_PROPERTY_FOR_EQUITY.md) gets the same $22M equity outcome with less complexity -- just without the tax savings on top.
