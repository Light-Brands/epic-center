## Overview

Comprehensive property research for establishing a luxury treatment/wellness facility in Costa Rica's Pacific Northwest. Targeting 10-20 room facilities across the Guanacaste province and Nicoya Peninsula, with particular focus on Santa Teresa/Mal Pais, Nosara, and the broader Blue Zone region.

**Approach:** All properties scored against a 100-point framework with compliance flags (no auto-disqualifications). Budget is flexible — evaluating on value across all modalities (ibogaine, ayahuasca, bio-optimization).

## Key Findings

- **22 candidate properties identified** across Guanacaste and Nicoya Peninsula ($495K-$5.75M)
- **5 properties fully evaluated** using 100-point framework
- **Top scores: 74/100** (Luxury Wellness Retreat and Finca Santa Elena tied)
- **Medical access is the universal challenge** — no JCI hospital within 30 minutes of any coastal property; mitigated through on-site medical investment + air evacuation
- **Best value:** Finca Santa Elena — $2.5M for 34 acres, 21 rooms, yoga studio, restaurant
- **Most turnkey:** Luxury Wellness Retreat — operating retreat with ceremony grounds, 15%+ cap rate

## Next Steps

1. Contact agents for top 3 properties (Wellness Retreat, Finca Santa Elena, ST Ocean View)
2. Engage Costa Rican real estate attorney
3. Plan 5-7 day site visit covering Santa Teresa, Nosara, Santa Cruz, and Samara
4. Research air evacuation service providers in Guanacaste
