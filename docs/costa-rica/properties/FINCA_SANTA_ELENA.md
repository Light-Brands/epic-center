| 1. Medical Infrastructure | 20 | 13 |
| 2. Location & Accessibility | 15 | 11 |
| 3. Property & Building | 15 | 11 |

| **TOTAL SCORE** | **100** | **74/100** |

**Classification:** ☐ Excellent (85+) | ☐ Very Good (75-84) | ✅ Good (65-74) | ☐ Marginal (55-64) | ☐ Poor (<55)

**Context:** Tied for highest score (74) with the Luxury Wellness Retreat. This property scores highest on the practical fundamentals — medical access (13/20 — best of all properties), privacy (12/12), accessibility (11/15), and titled land. Where it loses points is the "intangible" categories: natural beauty and strategic fit suffer from the inland, non-coastal location. This is the most practical choice; the question is whether "practical" or "inspirational" matters more.

## Financial Summary

| Line Item | Estimate |
|-----------|----------|
| Acquisition Price | $2,500,000 |
| Conversion/Renovation | $2,180,000 |
| Medical Equipment | $750,000 |
| Bio-optimization Equipment | $450,000 |
| FF&E (luxury upgrades across casitas) | $400,000 |
| Technology (Starlink, security, medical monitoring) | $250,000 |
| Pre-opening (staff, licensing, marketing) | $200,000 |
| Working Capital (6 months) | $400,000 |
| Contingency (15%) | $520,000 |
| **TOTAL PROJECT COST** | **$7,650,000** |
| **Cost per Guest Room (15 rooms operational)** | **$510,000** |

**Assessment:** $510K/room is the most efficient total investment of any property evaluated, despite the higher conversion costs. The $2.5M acquisition for 34 acres and 21 rooms is extraordinary value. The trade-off is higher renovation investment to bring casitas to luxury standard.

## Key Strengths

1. **Best medical access** — 30-45 min to Nicoya hospital, Cruz Roja coverage, 34 acres for helipad. Scores 13/20 on medical vs. 7-8/20 for coastal properties
2. **Extraordinary value** — $2.5M for 34 acres, 21 rooms, restaurant, pool, yoga studio at $119K/room acquisition cost. Room for unlimited expansion
3. **Individual casitas = ideal treatment model** — Stand-alone guest units provide maximum privacy between guests and natural separation between treatment phases/protocols

## Key Concerns

1. **Inland location — no ocean** — Lacks the coastal "destination" appeal of Santa Teresa or Nosara. May be harder to market as a premium retreat without beach/ocean narrative
2. **Building quality unknown** — 17 casitas across 34 acres may vary significantly in condition. Renovation costs could escalate if structures need major work
3. **Santa Cruz is not a tourist destination** — While safe and well-serviced, it lacks the spiritual/wellness culture that Santa Teresa and Nosara offer. Staff recruitment for specialized roles may be more challenging

## Questions to Resolve

1. What is the condition of each casita? Are they en-suite? What level of renovation is needed to reach luxury standard?
2. What is the current operation — how is it marketed, who are the guests, what are occupancy rates and revenue?
3. Is there ocean view potential from any elevated point on the 34 acres, or is it completely flat/inland?

## Recommendation

✅ **SHORTLIST** — Proceed to site visit and due diligence

**Rationale:** This is the most practical and financially efficient candidate in the search. The 34-acre land size, titled ownership, best-in-class medical access (for Costa Rica), and individual casita format check every operational box. The concern is marketing — can an inland, non-coastal property command premium treatment center rates ($15,000-25,000/week)? The answer may lie in positioning: "Blue Zone Wellness Sanctuary" emphasizing the Nicoya Peninsula longevity connection, with optional beach excursion days to nearby coast (30-45 min to Samara or Nosara beaches). The 34 acres also allows for creating an immersive world on-site — gardens, trails, water features, ceremony spaces — that reduces the need for external destination appeal.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Contact Coldwell Banker Tamarindo for site visit, financials, and detailed casita-by-casita condition report
2. Drive time verification to Hospital La Anexión (Nicoya) and Cruz Roja Santa Cruz
3. Assess ocean view potential and natural features on the 34-acre property
4. Get structural engineer assessment of casita conditions (sample 5-6 units)
5. Explore "Blue Zone Longevity Retreat" branding potential with Nicoya connection
