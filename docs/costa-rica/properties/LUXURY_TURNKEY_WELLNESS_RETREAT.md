| **TOTAL SCORE** | **100** | **74/100** |

**Classification:** ☐ Excellent (85+) | ☐ Very Good (75-84) | ✅ Good (65-74) | ☐ Marginal (55-64) | ☐ Poor (<55)

**Context:** Highest overall score of properties evaluated. The only significant gap is medical infrastructure (8/20), which is a regional challenge. This property achieves perfect scores in Privacy (12/12), Regulatory (10/10), and Strategic Fit (2/2) — the three hardest categories to fix post-acquisition. Medical infrastructure can be addressed through operational investment (on-site team, air evacuation), while regulatory and privacy fundamentals cannot be retrofitted.

## Conversion Assessment

| Element | Current State | Conversion Needs | Est. Cost |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| Medical Suite | ☐ Must create | Convert one building/room to medical-grade suite | $250,000 |
| Treatment/Ceremony Room | ✅ Exists | Ceremonial grounds operational; may need upgrades for ibogaine protocols | $50,000 |
| Commercial Kitchen | ✅ Exists | Serving 135+ meals/day; may need dietary-specific modifications | $50,000 |
| Guest Bathrooms | ☐ Assessment needed | 25 rooms / 10 baths — shared bath situation needs resolution | $300,000 |
| Staff Quarters | ☐ Likely exists | Operating retreat has staff facilities; verify adequacy | $50,000 |
| Group/Integration Space | ✅ Exists | 2 yoga studios, multiple gathering spaces | $0 |
| Bio-optimization Area | ☐ Must create | Convert space within spa area or build addition | $200,000 |
| Outdoor Treatment Spaces | ✅ Exists | Ceremonial grounds, sweat lodge, gardens | $25,000 |
| Generator/Backup Power | ☐ Assessment needed | May exist; medical-grade upgrade likely needed | $80,000 |
| Water System Upgrade | ☐ Assessment needed | 48-guest system exists; verify for medical standards | $50,000 |
| Septic/Waste Treatment | ☐ Assessment needed | Operating at scale; medical waste protocol addition | $25,000 |
| **TOTAL CONVERSION** | | | **$1,080,000** |

**Key Conversion Note:** The 25:10 bedroom-to-bathroom ratio needs investigation. If bathrooms are shared, significant bathroom addition investment is required for luxury treatment standard.

## Financial Summary

| Line Item | Estimate |
|-----------|----------|
| Acquisition Price | $3,987,000 |
| Conversion/Renovation | $1,080,000 |
| Medical Equipment | $750,000 |
| Bio-optimization Equipment | $450,000 |
| FF&E (luxury upgrades) | $250,000 |
| Technology (Starlink, security, medical monitoring) | $250,000 |
| Pre-opening (licensing, marketing — staff mostly in place) | $150,000 |
| Working Capital (6 months) | $400,000 |
| Contingency (15%) | $547,000 |
| **TOTAL PROJECT COST** | **$7,864,000** |
| **Cost per Guest Room (15 rooms operational)** | **$524,267** |

**Assessment:** Operating 15 of the 25 rooms at $524K/room is below the $750K benchmark. The existing operating business value (15%+ cap rate) means the acquisition includes a revenue-generating asset from day one, significantly de-risking the investment.

**Business Value Consideration:** At 15%+ cap rate on a $3.99M property, the existing business generates ~$600K+ annually. This means the property partially self-funds the conversion period — a major advantage over non-operating properties.

## Key Strengths

1. **Closest to target operation** — ceremonial grounds, sweat lodge, yoga studios, spa, and gourmet kitchen mean this property was built for exactly the type of facility envisioned
2. **Proven business model** — 15%+ cap rate with full bookings validates the market and provides revenue during conversion to treatment center
3. **Zero red compliance flags** — no disqualifying issues found; all flags are yellow (information gaps) resolvable through due diligence

## Key Concerns

1. **Bathroom ratio** — 25 bedrooms with only 10 bathrooms suggests shared facilities; luxury treatment center requires en-suite throughout, potentially adding $300K+ in conversion cost
2. **Location opacity** — exact location not publicly disclosed; hospital distance, road quality, and natural setting cannot be fully assessed until location is revealed
3. **Larger than target** — 25 rooms (48-guest capacity) exceeds the 10-20 room target; operating at partial capacity means maintaining infrastructure for unused spaces

## Questions to Resolve

1. What is the exact property location? (Critical for hospital distance, road access, natural setting assessment)
2. What is the bathroom situation — are rooms en-suite or shared? What is the room/building configuration?
3. What are the existing staff contracts, compensation structure, and transition expectations?

---

## Recommendation

✅ **SHORTLIST** — Proceed to site visit and due diligence

**Rationale:** This is the most operationally aligned property found in the entire Costa Rica search. The existing ceremonial grounds, sweat lodge, dual yoga studios, spa, and 135-meal-per-day kitchen infrastructure represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in avoided conversion cost and — more importantly — established operational systems and staff knowledge. The 15%+ cap rate proves the market and provides revenue during any transition period. The zero red flags and perfect regulatory/privacy scores mean the hardest-to-fix attributes are already in place. The main risk is information gaps (exact location, bathroom configuration) that can be resolved with a single phone call to the listing agent.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Contact Properties in Costa Rica (+1 888-607-6772) to request exact location, detailed floor plans, financial statements, and site visit
2. Upon learning location: map hospital distance, road quality, and natural setting
3. Request staff roster, contracts, and compensation details
4. Evaluate bathroom renovation scope and cost
5. Discuss ceremony/plant medicine licensing status and history
