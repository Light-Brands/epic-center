## Score Summary

| Category | Max | Score |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1. Medical Infrastructure | 20 | 7 |
| 2. Location & Accessibility | 15 | 9 |
| 3. Property & Building | 15 | 12 |
| 4. Privacy & Security | 12 | 10 |
| 5. Regulatory & Legal | 10 | 7 |
| 6. Infrastructure & Utilities | 8 | 5 |
| 7. Financial Considerations | 8 | 5 |
| 8. Natural Environment | 6 | 6 |
| 9. Risk Factors | 4 | 2 |
| 10. Strategic Fit | 2 | 2 |
| **TOTAL SCORE** | **100** | **65/100** |

**Classification:** ☐ Excellent (85+) | ☐ Very Good (75-84) | ✅ Good (65-74) | ☐ Marginal (55-64) | ☐ Poor (<55)

**Context:** Scores 65/100 — competitive but below the top three candidates. The property excels on natural environment (6/6), strategic fit (2/2), and privacy (10/12). The name "Blue Zone Resort" is already aligned with the longevity/wellness brand. The main weakness is medical infrastructure (7/20) without the mitigating advantages that other properties have (no nearby airstrip like Nosara, not near a hospital like Finca Santa Elena). Avellanas sits in a "middle ground" — not as remote as Santa Teresa but not as accessible as Tamarindo.

## Key Strengths

1. **Blue Zone branding built-in** — the property is literally named "Blue Zone Resort" in the Nicoya Peninsula longevity zone; marketing narrative writes itself
2. **16 en-suite rooms** — the highest room count of any Tier 1-2 candidate with full en-suite bathrooms; no bathroom renovation needed
3. **Avellanas positioning** — quieter and more authentic than Tamarindo, closer to infrastructure than Santa Teresa; good middle ground

## Key Concerns

1. **Medical access gap without airstrip** — unlike Nosara (NOB) or Santa Teresa (TMU accessible), Avellanas has no nearby domestic airstrip, making air evacuation more complex
2. **Limited listing details** — less information available than other candidates; need agent contact for full property details
3. **Avellanas road access** — last stretch to Avellanas is unpaved; rainy season access needs verification

## Questions to Resolve

1. Is the property on titled land or ZMT concession?
2. What is the full amenity list — pool, restaurant, wellness spaces?
3. What is the current operational status — occupancy, revenue, staff?

---

## Recommendation

☐ **SHORTLIST** — Proceed to site visit and due diligence
✅ **HOLD** — Monitor, needs more information
☐ **PASS** — Does not meet requirements

**Rationale:** The Blue Zone Resort is an intriguing candidate with the right name, location, and capacity, but too many information gaps remain for a full shortlist recommendation. The 16 en-suite rooms and Blue Zone positioning are attractive. However, without a nearby airstrip and with less detail available than other candidates, this property sits behind the top three in priority. Request full property information from Coldwell Banker and re-evaluate for potential upgrade to Shortlist.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Contact Coldwell Banker Tamarindo for full property details, photos, and financials
2. Verify titled vs. ZMT land status
3. Map exact hospital distance and air evacuation options
4. Assess Avellanas road conditions in rainy season
