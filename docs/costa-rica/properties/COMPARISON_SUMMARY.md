# Property Comparison Summary — Costa Rica

> *Side-by-Side Analysis of Top Candidates*
> *February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Five properties were fully evaluated using the adapted 100-point Costa Rica Property Evaluation Framework. Two properties tied for the top score (74/100), followed by a close cluster. No property scores above 75 primarily due to the regional medical infrastructure challenge — the highest-weighted category (20 points) is structurally limited across all Guanacaste/Nicoya Peninsula locations.

**Key Finding:** The optimal strategy is likely a **property-plus-medical-investment approach**: acquire the best-aligned facility and invest heavily in on-site medical capability and air evacuation partnerships rather than compromising on brand, privacy, or natural environment to gain marginal hospital proximity.

### Operating Cost Benchmarks (Costa Rica)

| Cost Category | Monthly Estimate (10-15 room facility) | Annual |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|--------|
| **Staff (20-25 people)** | $40,000-70,000 (incl. social charges) | $480K-840K |
| **Utilities (power, water, internet)** | $3,000-6,000 | $36K-72K |
| **Food & Beverage** | $8,000-15,000 (organic, dietary) | $96K-180K |
| **Maintenance & Supplies** | $3,000-5,000 | $36K-60K |
| **Insurance** | $2,000-4,000 | $24K-48K |
| **Marketing** | $5,000-10,000 | $60K-120K |
| **Administrative/Legal** | $3,000-5,000 | $36K-60K |
| **Medical Supplies** | $5,000-10,000 | $60K-120K |
| **TOTAL OPERATING** | **$69,000-125,000/mo** | **$828K-$1.5M/yr** |

### Revenue Benchmarks

| Metric | Conservative | Target | Aggressive |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Average Rate (per person/week)** | $8,000 | $15,000 | $22,000 |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 50% | 65% | 80% |
| **Rooms Operating** | 10 | 12 | 15 |
| **Weeks Operating** | 48 | 50 | 52 |
| **Annual Revenue** | $1.92M | $5.85M | $13.73M |
| **Annual Operating Cost** | $1.2M | $1.2M | $1.5M |
| **Net Operating Income** | $720K | $4.65M | $12.23M |

**Note:** Rythmia (comparable Guanacaste wellness retreat) charges $5,000-8,000/week for 7-day ayahuasca programs. A multi-modality treatment center (ibogaine, bio-optimization, luxury medical) would command premium pricing.

### Construction & Renovation Cost Context

| Type | Cost per m² (USD) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Basic renovation** | $800-1,200 | Cosmetic upgrades, painting, fixtures |
| **Standard construction** | $1,200-2,000 | New rooms, standard commercial |
| **Luxury construction** | $2,000-3,500 | High-end finishes, imported materials |
| **Medical-grade** | $2,500-4,000 | Clean rooms, medical systems, O2 lines |
| **Pool (new)** | $40,000-100,000 | Depending on size and type |
| **Helipad** | $50,000-100,000 | Concrete pad + lighting + FAA-equiv compliance |

## Strategic Analysis

### Head-to-Head: The Two 74-Scorers

| Factor | Luxury Wellness Retreat | Finca Santa Elena |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Best at** | Operational readiness, privacy, regulatory | Medical access, value, compliance |
| **Biggest risk** | Bathroom ratio (25:10), location opacity | Building condition unknown, inland location |
| **Conversion effort** | Minimal — already operating as retreat | Significant — luxury upgrades across 17 casitas |
| **Brand narrative** | "World-class retreat, now with medical" | "Blue Zone sanctuary, healing through longevity" |
| **Revenue risk** | Low — 15%+ cap rate, existing bookings | Medium — less proven guest demand |
| **Medical strategy** | On-site + helicopter + TBD airstrip access | On-site + helicopter + helipad + closer to hospitals |
| **Expansion potential** | Good (7.5 acres) | Exceptional (34 acres) |
| **Key question** | Where exactly is it? | Can inland command premium rates? |

### The Medical Access Dilemma

All five properties share the fundamental Costa Rica challenge: no JCI hospital within 30 minutes. The scoring reflects this reality, but it's important to note that this challenge is **shared by ALL competing facilities in the region**, including Rythmia (which has operated safely for 10+ years).

**Mitigation Strategy (applies to any chosen property):**
1. **On-site medical team:** Full-time physician + 2 nurses + cardiac monitoring equipment (~$300K/yr)
2. **On-site emergency bay:** Equipped stabilization room with O2, crash cart, cardiac monitoring (~$150K setup)
3. **Air evacuation contract:** Helicopter service to CIMA San Jose (~$8-15K/flight; annual retainer ~$50K)
4. **Ground ambulance protocol:** Cruz Roja pre-arranged rapid response
5. **Guest screening:** Enhanced pre-arrival medical screening to reduce emergency probability
6. **Medical director oversight:** Board-certified physician directing all treatment protocols

**Cost of medical mitigation package:** ~$500K setup + ~$400K/year operating

This investment is necessary regardless of which property is chosen and should be factored into all financial models.

## Dual-Property Strategy

As noted in the Mexico research, a hub-and-spoke model may optimize Costa Rica's geographic challenges:

### Option A: Santa Teresa Flagship + Liberia Medical Hub
- **Primary:** Santa Teresa Ocean View Boutique Hotel ($3M + $1M conversion)
- **Secondary:** Small medical liaison office near Liberia Hospital ($100-200K lease/purchase)
- **Benefit:** Premium brand location + medical safety net
- **Risk:** Distance between hub and spoke (3.5 hrs ground)

### Option B: Finca Santa Elena + Coastal Day Program
- **Primary:** Finca Santa Elena retreat ($2.5M + $2.2M conversion)
- **Secondary:** Beach/surf partnership in Samara or Nosara (day trip program)
- **Benefit:** Best medical access + Blue Zone story + ocean experience
- **Risk:** Inland location requires compelling on-site experience

### Option C: Wellness Retreat (as-is, enhanced)
- **Primary:** Luxury Turnkey Wellness Retreat ($4M + $1M conversion)
- **Standalone:** Enhanced on-site medical + helipad
- **Benefit:** Simplest execution, proven operations
- **Risk:** Unknown exact location; bathroom renovation scope

### Decision Framework

| If you prioritize... | Choose... | Because... |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Operational readiness** | Luxury Wellness Retreat | Already operating with ceremony grounds, staff, and revenue |
| **Medical safety** | Finca Santa Elena | Closest to hospitals, best compliance, helipad-ready |
| **Brand prestige** | ST Ocean View Boutique | Santa Teresa is the aspirational destination |
| **Value** | Green Sanctuary | Lowest total investment for a prime Nosara location |
| **Blue Zone narrative** | Finca Santa Elena or Blue Zone Resort | Both in the Nicoya Blue Zone; Santa Elena has the land for immersive longevity programming |
