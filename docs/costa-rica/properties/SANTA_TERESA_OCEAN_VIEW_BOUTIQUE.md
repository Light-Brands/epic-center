## Compliance Flag Assessment

| Gate | Requirement | Flag | Notes |
|------|-------------|------|-------|
| G1 | Hospital ≤45 min | 🔴 | Cobano EBAIS clinic ~25 min; Liberia hospital 3.5+ hrs; Nicoya hospital ~2 hrs |
| G2 | Cardiac capability nearby | 🔴 | No cardiac cath lab within 3 hours; nearest at CIMA San Jose (5 hrs) or Liberia (basic) |
| G3 | ≥5 bedrooms or expansion space | 🟢 | 13 rooms — exceeds minimum; ideal capacity |
| G4 | Zoning permits use | 🟡 | Hotel already operating; medical/wellness overlay requires municipal consultation |
| G5 | Safe area for international guests | 🟢 | Santa Teresa is safe for international visitors; active expat community |
| G6 | Clear title (titled land preferred) | 🟡 | **MUST VERIFY** — many Santa Teresa properties are ZMT concession; hillside properties more likely titled |
| G7 | Utilities available | 🟡 | ICE power grid (occasional outages); ASADA water (dry season stress); Starlink for internet |
| G8 | Road access (rainy season passable) | 🟡 | Main Santa Teresa road partly paved; access roads often unpaved; passable but challenging in heavy rains |
| G9 | Structurally sound / seismic code | 🟡 | Operating hotel suggests structural soundness; seismic assessment needed for medical conversion |

**FLAG SUMMARY:** 2 🟢 5 🟡 2 🔴

**Critical Note on Red Flags:** Both red flags relate to hospital/cardiac access — the fundamental challenge of ANY Santa Teresa property. Mitigation strategy: enhanced on-site medical team + helicopter evacuation agreement + Tambor airstrip (TMU) 30-40 min away for fixed-wing air ambulance.

**Classification:** ☐ Excellent (85+) | ☐ Very Good (75-84) | ✅ Good (65-74) | ☐ Marginal (55-64) | ☐ Poor (<55)

**Context:** The score is depressed primarily by medical infrastructure (7/20) — a challenge for ALL Santa Teresa properties. The property itself scores exceptionally (14/15 on Property & Building, 6/6 on Environment, 2/2 on Strategic Fit). With an enhanced on-site medical strategy, the effective operational capability would be higher than the score suggests.

## Financial Summary

| Line Item | Estimate |
|-----------|----------|
| Acquisition Price | $3,000,000 |
| Conversion/Renovation | $1,005,000 |
| Medical Equipment | $750,000 |
| Bio-optimization Equipment | $450,000 |
| FF&E (upgrade to luxury standard) | $300,000 |
| Technology (Starlink, security, medical monitoring) | $250,000 |
| Pre-opening (staff, licensing, marketing) | $200,000 |
| Working Capital (6 months) | $400,000 |
| Contingency (15%) | $540,000 |
| **TOTAL PROJECT COST** | **$6,895,000** |
| **Cost per Guest Room** | **$530,385** |

**Assessment:** At $530K per guest room, this is well under the $750K/room target benchmark. The existing infrastructure (3 pools, yoga shala, restaurant, 13 en-suite rooms) significantly reduces conversion costs.

---

## Key Strengths

1. **Exceptional existing wellness infrastructure** — yoga shala, 3 pools, restaurant, and 13 en-suite rooms provide a near-ready wellness facility platform
2. **Perfect brand alignment** — Santa Teresa's spiritual surf culture, Blue Zone proximity, and natural beauty create ideal positioning for luxury treatment center
3. **Strong per-room economics** — $530K/room total investment is well below benchmark, leveraging existing built infrastructure

## Key Concerns

1. **Medical infrastructure gap** — No quality hospital within 45 minutes; cardiac capability is 3+ hours away. Requires significant investment in on-site medical capability and air evacuation agreements
2. **Access challenges** — 3.5+ hours from LIR airport; unpaved roads challenging in rainy season; guest logistics complex
3. **Land type uncertainty** — Must verify titled vs. ZMT concession status. If ZMT concession, adds legal complexity and foreign ownership restrictions

## Questions to Resolve

1. Is the property on titled land or ZMT concession? (Critical for ownership structure)
2. What are the current financials — occupancy rate, average daily rate, annual revenue/profit?
3. What is the building condition and seismic compliance status? (Engineering assessment needed)

---

## Recommendation

✅ **SHORTLIST** — Proceed to site visit and due diligence

**Rationale:** This is the strongest candidate for the target treatment facility model. The existing yoga shala, three pools, restaurant, and 13 en-suite rooms provide a near-ready platform that minimizes conversion cost and timeline. The medical access challenge is shared by ALL Santa Teresa properties and can be mitigated through enhanced on-site medical capability + air evacuation. The brand alignment is exceptional — Santa Teresa's spiritual wellness culture, Blue Zone proximity, and stunning natural beauty create a compelling narrative for UHNW clients seeking transformational experiences.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Contact Malpais Properties for current asking price, financials, and land type verification
2. Commission title search at Registro Nacional
3. Arrange site visit with structural engineer
4. Research air evacuation service providers (helicopter + Tambor fixed-wing)
