| 10. Strategic Fit | 2 | 2 |
| **TOTAL SCORE** | **100** | **67/100** |

**Classification:** ☐ Excellent (85+) | ☐ Very Good (75-84) | ✅ Good (65-74) | ☐ Marginal (55-64) | ☐ Poor (<55)

**Context:** Scores 67/100 — competitive but below the Luxury Retreat and Finca Santa Elena (both 74). The Nosara airstrip (NOB) is a significant differentiator for both guest access and medical evacuation, earning the best Location score (12/15) of any property. The lower Property & Building score (9/15) reflects fewer existing amenities compared to the turnkey retreat or Santa Teresa hotel. The price point ($1.99M) is the most attractive of any Tier 1 candidate.

## Financial Summary

| Line Item | Estimate |
|-----------|----------|
| Acquisition Price | $1,995,000 |
| Conversion/Renovation | $1,375,000 |
| Medical Equipment | $750,000 |

## Key Strengths

1. **Nosara airstrip (NOB)** — 10-15 min to domestic airstrip with Sansa flights to SJO. Critical advantage for both guest access (35-min flight vs. 5-hr drive) and medical evacuation
2. **Best value Tier 1 candidate** — $1.99M acquisition for 12-room property in Nosara's premium K-Section; total project under $6M
3. **Established wellness community** — Nosara's 20+ year yoga/wellness culture provides instant community context, staff talent pool, and brand alignment

## Key Concerns

1. **Water scarcity** — Nosara's dry season water crisis is well-documented. A 24/7 medical facility with pools, kitchens, and laundry needs reliable water. Significant investment in rainwater harvesting and storage required
2. **Fewer existing amenities** — No pool, no yoga space, no ceremony grounds, no restaurant mentioned. More conversion investment needed compared to turnkey alternatives
3. **Container construction limitations** — While seismically resilient, container buildings may have acoustic/thermal challenges and may be difficult to modify for medical suite requirements

## Questions to Resolve

1. What is the land size and configuration? Is there expansion room for pool, bio-optimization center, ceremony space?
2. Is the property titled or ZMT concession? What K-Section community association rules apply?
3. What is the water supply situation — well, ASADA, or both? What is dry season capacity?

## Recommendation

☐ **SHORTLIST** — Proceed to site visit and due diligence
✅ **HOLD** — Monitor, needs more information
☐ **PASS** — Does not meet requirements

**Rationale:** The Green Sanctuary scores competitively and offers the best price point of any Tier 1 property, plus the critical Nosara airstrip advantage. However, the significant conversion needs (no pool, no yoga space, no ceremony area, limited amenities) increase the build-out risk and timeline compared to the more turnkey alternatives. The water scarcity concern is also more acute in Nosara than in other areas. Recommend requesting detailed property information (land size, water system, community rules) before committing to a site visit. If the land size accommodates the needed additions and water supply is addressable, this becomes a strong SHORTLIST candidate.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Request land size, plot plan, and K-Section community rules from Coldwell Banker
2. Investigate Nosara water situation — current ASADA capacity, well drilling feasibility
3. Assess container construction suitability for medical/treatment conversion
4. Compare total conversion cost and timeline against turnkey alternatives
