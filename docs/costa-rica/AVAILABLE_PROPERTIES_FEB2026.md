---

---

| **Asking Price** | $2,750,000 |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

**Description:** Architecturally unique hotel constructed from repurposed containers, blending sustainable design with contemporary elegance. Located in Nosara's prime K-Section near Playa Guiones. Includes a separate 2-bedroom house (perfect for medical director or on-site manager).

**Why it fits:**

---

## Tier 2: Worth Investigating

Strong properties that merit deeper research but have more significant trade-offs.

---

### 6. Eco Hotel & Chill House — Santa Teresa

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

Eight separate rental rooms around an infinity pool overlooking the beach. Eco-friendly design. At $1.75M, this is the most affordable Santa Teresa option but only 8 rooms — may need expansion.

---

### 7. Blue Zone Resort — Avellanas

| **Asking Price** | $2,900,000 |

Blue Zone location between Tamarindo and Nosara. 16 en-suite rooms on 2.42 acres. Avellanas is a quieter surf beach with good road access. The Blue Zone positioning is a natural brand fit.

---

### 8. Gecko Verde Jungle Hideaway — Samara

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Samara, Guanacaste |
| **Asking Price** | $1,795,000 |

Peaceful jungle setting near Samara beach. 12 rooms at under $1.8M is strong value. Samara has better road access than Santa Teresa and a more authentic feel than Tamarindo.

---

### 9. Tambor Tropical Hotel

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Playa Tambor, Nicoya Peninsula |
| **Asking Price** | $4,200,000 |

Beachfront boutique resort in Tambor. Key advantage: proximity to Tambor airstrip (TMU) for both guest access and air evacuation. Only 8 rooms is below target, but beachfront location is premium. Expensive per room.

---

### 10. Hotel Boruca — Tamarindo

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Tamarindo, Guanacaste |
| **Asking Price** | $3,000,000 |

| **Agent** | Carlo Beltramo, +506 8569-0191 |

Turnkey operation with restaurant, pool, walking distance to beach. $80/night average rate. Strong operational metrics but Tamarindo's party/tourist vibe is a brand concern.

---

| **Location** | Samara, Guanacaste |
| **Asking Price** | $1,950,000 |

### 12. Mother Earth Luxury Hotel — Tamarindo

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Tamarindo, Guanacaste |
| **Asking Price** | $5,750,000 |
| **Rooms** | 14 suites |
| **Listing** | [Blue Water Properties](https://bluewaterpropertiesofcostarica.com/costa-rica-real-estate/property/eco-luxury-hotel-investment-in-tamarindo-costa-rica/) |

The premium option. 14 exquisitely designed suites, rooftop yoga studio, award-winning organic restaurant, saltwater pool, natural spa. Already positioned as eco-luxury. High price point but closest to target brand out of the box.

---

## Tier 3: Consider If Right Opportunity

Properties with good attributes but more significant trade-offs on location, size, or brand fit.

---

### 13. Hotel Mangaby Beach — Playa Hermosa

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Playa Hermosa (Papagayo), Guanacaste |
| **Price** | $2,700,000 |
| **Rooms** | 17 |
| **Listing** | [RE/MAX](https://www.remax-centralamerica.com/costa-rica/playa-hermosa/hotel-mang-400171747015) |

**Best medical access** of any property found — 20 minutes from LIR airport, Liberia hospital within 35 min. 17 rooms, Blue Flag beach, bar/restaurant. But Playa Hermosa is a tourist area without wellness positioning.

---

### 14. Hotel Arco Iris — Tamarindo

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

| **Price** | $2,100,000 |
| **Rooms** | 13 |

Secluded property in gated estate. 2 acres with 9 individual casitas (good for privacy). $1.37M for 12 rooms is strong value ($114K/room). Casita format ideal for treatment center.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

| **Rooms** | 15 |

| **Price** | ~$1,500,000 (est.) |

| **Listing** | [Holprop.com](https://www.holprop.com/sale/hotel/costa_rica/montezuma/) |

Unique hilltop property 150m above sea level with saltwater pool, botanical gardens, and 1.5 hectares of private forest. Extremely private but Montezuma is very remote.

---

|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Playa Grande |
| **Price** | $1,200,000 |
| **Rooms** | 10 |
| **Land** | 0.52 acres |
| **Listing** | [Coldwell Banker #24360](https://www.coldwellbankertamarindo.com/hotel-leisure-for-sale) |

Currently themed as a Grateful Dead hotel (would need complete rebranding). Near world-class surf and Las Baulas National Park. 1 hour from LIR. Good value.

---

|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Playa Carrillo |
| **Price** | $1,200,000 |
| **Rooms** | 11 |

| **Listing** | [Coldwell Banker Samara #23786](https://www.coldwellbankersamara.com/property-for-sale/property-types/hotel-leisure) |

---

## Tier 4: Alternative / Long-Shot

Properties outside the primary search area or with significant conversion challenges but notable for specific reasons.

---

### 20. Amatierra Eco-Retreat — Turrubares

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Turrubares mountains (between San Jose and Pacific coast) |
| **Price** | $997,000 |
| **Rooms** | 10 + 3-bed owner's apartment |
| **Land** | 3 hectares (7.5 acres) |
| **Listing** | [Christie's Costa Rica](https://costaricachristiesrealestate.com/properties/eco-retreat-and-wellness-center-amatierra) |

Operating meditation/wellness/yoga retreat center. One of Costa Rica's best jungle yoga structures. Turnkey with trained staff. Under $1M is remarkable value. However, location is NOT in Guanacaste/Nicoya — it's in the central mountains between San Jose and Jaco.

---

### 21. Living Forest Retreat — Lake Arenal

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Near Lake Arenal, Guanacaste |
| **Price** | $495,000 |
| **Rooms** | 9 |
| **Land** | 1.5 acres old-growth forest |
| **Listing** | [LivingForestForSale.com](https://www.livingforestforsale.com/) |

Lowest price found for a retreat-suitable property. Old-growth forest, river setting, cedar sauna. 1.5 hours from LIR. Mountain/inland location, no ocean access. Would need significant investment to reach luxury standard.

---

### 22. Montezuma Hotel Complex

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | Montezuma |
| **Price** | $950,000 |
| **Rooms** | 10 (across 7 buildings) |
| **Land** | 1.42 acres |
| **Listing** | [Coldwell Banker](https://www.coldwellbankercostarica.com/real-estate/montezuma-costa-rica/hotel-leisure) |

7 separate buildings including cabins, houses, and a lodge sleeping 14. Most affordable 10-room option but scattered layout and Montezuma remoteness are challenges.

---

## Top Recommendations

### Best Overall: Santa Teresa Ocean View Boutique Hotel (#1)
13 rooms with yoga shala, 3 pools, restaurant, ocean views, turnkey. The existing wellness infrastructure and prime Santa Teresa location make this the strongest single candidate. Medical access requires enhanced on-site capability + air evacuation plan.

### Best Value: Finca Santa Elena (#3)
21 rooms on 34 acres for $2.5M. The sheer land size allows for helipad, gardens, full privacy, and future expansion. Individual casitas provide treatment privacy. Inland location trades ocean views for accessibility and value.

### Best Turnkey: Luxury Wellness Retreat (#2)
Already operating as a wellness retreat with ceremony grounds, proven 15%+ cap rate, experienced staff. Closest to target operation out of the box. Higher price point at $3.98M but includes operating business.

### Best Medical Access: Hotel Mangaby Beach (#13)
20 minutes from LIR, 35 min from Liberia hospital. If medical access is weighted highest, this is the strongest candidate. Needs brand repositioning from tourist hotel to wellness facility.

### Best Nosara Option: Green Sanctuary (#5)
10 en-suite rooms + manager's house for under $2M in Nosara's prime section. Near airstrip for both access and evacuation. Established wellness community context.

### Dual-Property Strategy
Consider pairing:
- **Primary facility** in Santa Teresa or Nosara (brand, healing environment, privacy)
- **Medical liaison hub** near Liberia (emergency support, supply logistics, staff medical)
- **Blue Zone excursion** program from either location to Nicoya inland
