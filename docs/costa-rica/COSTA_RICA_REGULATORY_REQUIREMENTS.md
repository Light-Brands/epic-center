## 1. Property Ownership for Foreigners {#1-property-ownership}

### 1.1 Direct Foreign Ownership

Costa Rica is one of the most foreign-ownership-friendly countries in Latin America.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Foreign Ownership Right** | Foreigners have the same property rights as citizens under the Costa Rica Constitution |
| **Fideicomiso Required?** | **NO** — unlike Mexico, no bank trust required for coastal property |
| **Title Registration** | Registered in the Registro Nacional (National Registry) |
| **Ownership Vehicle** | Direct personal name OR Costa Rican corporation (S.A./S.R.L.) |

### 1.2 Titled Land vs. Concession Land (ZMT)

This is the **single most important distinction** in Costa Rica real estate.

**Zona Marítima Terrestre (ZMT) — Maritime Terrestrial Zone:**

| Zone | Distance | Rules |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Public Zone** | 0-50 meters from high tide line | Cannot be owned or built on — public land |
| **Restricted Zone** | 50-200 meters from high tide line | Concession only — NOT ownership. Foreigners cannot hold concessions unless they've been legal residents for 5+ years or hold majority through a Costa Rican corporation with >50% Costa Rican ownership |
| **Beyond 200m** | 200+ meters from high tide | Normal titled land — full foreign ownership |

**Critical ZMT Considerations:**

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Concession ≠ Ownership** | ZMT concessions are granted by municipality, typically 5-20 year renewable terms |
| **Revocation Risk** | Government can revoke concessions (rare but possible) |
| **Transfer Complexity** | Concession transfer requires municipal approval, can take 6-18 months |
| **Foreign Restrictions** | Direct foreign concession ownership requires 5+ years residency |
| **Workaround** | Costa Rican S.A. with >50% Tico ownership can hold concessions |
| **Due Diligence** | ALWAYS verify if property is titled or concession via Registro Nacional |

**Recommendation:** Strongly prefer titled land (beyond 200m from high tide). Many hillside properties in Santa Teresa and Nosara are titled. If considering ZMT concession property, budget additional legal costs and time for transfer.

### 1.3 Corporation (S.A.) Ownership

Most foreign buyers use a Sociedad Anónima (S.A.) to hold property:

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Transfer Tax Savings** | Transfer corporate shares instead of property — avoids 1.5% transfer tax |
| **Liability Protection** | Corporate veil separates personal assets |
| **Operational Vehicle** | Same entity can operate the business |
| **Banking** | Easier to open commercial accounts |
| **Succession** | Simplified inheritance planning |

**S.A. Requirements:**
- Minimum 2 shareholders (can be same family/entity)
- Registered legal agent (lawyer) in Costa Rica
- Annual corporate tax filing ($0-$478 depending on income)
- Registered at Registro Nacional
- Annual beneficial ownership declaration (Registro de Transparencia y Beneficiarios Finales)

### 1.4 Property Transfer Process

| Step | Timeframe | Cost |
|------|-----------|------|
| Due diligence + title search | 2-4 weeks | $2,000-5,000 legal fees |
| Purchase agreement (opción de compra) | 1-2 weeks | Typically 10% deposit |
| Transfer at Registro Nacional | 2-4 weeks | 1.5% transfer tax + 0.5% stamps + legal fees |
| Total closing costs | | ~3.5-4.5% of property value |

**Transfer Tax Breakdown:**
- Transfer tax: 1.5% of declared/fiscal value (whichever is higher)
- Documentary stamps: 0.5%
- Notarial fees: 1-2%
- Legal fees: 1-1.5%
- Registry fees: Minimal

## 2. Medical & Wellness Facility Licensing {#2-medical-licensing}

### 2.1 Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud)

All health-related facilities require a **Permiso Sanitario de Funcionamiento** (Sanitary Operating Permit):

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Application** | Submitted to regional Ministry of Health office (Liberia for Guanacaste) |
| **Facility Requirements** | Must meet specific infrastructure standards per Decreto Ejecutivo 30571-S |
| **Medical Director** | Licensed physician (registered with Colegio de Médicos) must be designated |
| **Timeline** | 2-6 months for approval |
| **Cost** | ~$500-2,000 in fees + facility compliance costs |
| **Renewal** | Annual |

### 2.2 Healthcare Facility Classification

| Classification | Description | Requirements | Applicable? |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Hospital** | In-patient medical facility | Full hospital regulations | Likely overkill |
| **Clínica** | Outpatient medical facility | Medical director, equipment standards | Possible pathway |
| **Centro de Rehabilitación** | Rehabilitation center | IAFA + Ministry of Health dual licensing | If substance treatment |
| **Spa/Wellness Center** | Non-medical wellness | Lighter regulation, no medical claims | Bio-optimization only |
| **Hotel with Medical Services** | Hospitality + on-site medical | Hotel license + contracted medical | **Recommended hybrid** |

**Recommended Approach:** License as a hospitality/hotel facility with contracted on-site medical services, similar to Rythmia's model. This avoids full hospital/clinic regulation while maintaining medical capability.

### 2.3 IAFA Licensing (Substance Treatment)

If operating any substance treatment program (including ibogaine-assisted):

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **IAFA Registration** | Mandatory for any entity treating substance use disorders |
| **Standards** | Must meet IAFA's "Normas de Habilitación" for treatment centers |
| **Staffing** | Licensed medical director, psychologist, social worker, nursing |
| **Facility** | Specific room requirements, safety standards, patient rights protocols |
| **Timeline** | 6-12 months for full IAFA certification |
| **Oversight** | Regular inspections, reporting requirements |
| **Cost** | $5,000-15,000 in compliance costs + ongoing |

### 2.4 Medical Professional Licensing

| Professional | Licensing Body | Requirements |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Physician (MD)** | Colegio de Médicos y Cirujanos | Medical degree validation, board exam, registration |
| **Nurse** | Colegio de Enfermeras | Nursing degree validation, registration |
| **Psychologist** | Colegio de Psicólogos | Degree validation, registration |
| **Foreign Physicians** | Colegio de Médicos | Degree authentication (apostille), equivalency exam, Spanish proficiency |
| **Timeline for Foreign MD** | | 6-18 months for full credentialing |

**Strategy:** Hire Costa Rican-licensed physicians initially while credentialing foreign medical director.

### 2.5 Medical Equipment Import

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Registration** | Medical devices must be registered with Ministry of Health |
| **Import Duties** | 0-15% depending on classification |
| **Exemptions** | Some medical equipment qualifies for duty-free import |
| **Customs Agent** | Specialized customs broker recommended for medical imports |
| **Timeline** | 2-4 months for registration + import clearance |

---

## 3. Plant Medicine Legal Landscape {#3-plant-medicine}

### 3.1 Legal Status Overview

| Substance | Legal Status | Risk Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Ayahuasca** | **Grey area** — DMT is controlled under Law #8204, but plant preparations occupy legal grey zone | Medium | Rythmia model demonstrates licensed pathway |
| **Ibogaine** | **Not specifically scheduled** — but not clearly legal either | High | NOT RECOMMENDED for initial operations |
| **Psilocybin** | **Controlled** (listed since 2020), lax enforcement | High | Not viable for licensed facility |
| **Cannabis** | **Medical use decriminalized** (2022 law) | Low | Possible ancillary |
| **5-MeO-DMT** | **Not specifically addressed** | Medium-High | Legal ambiguity |
| **Ketamine** | **Controlled substance** — medical use possible with proper licensing | Medium | Requires physician administration |
| **Kambo** | **Legal** — not a controlled substance, traditional medicine | Low | Can be offered openly |

### 3.2 The Rythmia Model — Licensed Pathway

Rythmia Life Advancement Center (Guanacaste) demonstrates the viable licensed approach:

| Aspect | How Rythmia Does It |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Licensing** | Costa Rica Ministry of Health + IAFA + Municipal permits |
| **Legal Claim** | "Only medically licensed plant medicine center in the world" |
| **Plant Selection** | Banisteriopsis caapi, uña de gato, Mimosa tenuiflora, Nicotiana rustica |
| **Key Distinction** | Uses "plant medicine" not "ayahuasca" in official licensing |
| **Medical Structure** | Chief Medical Officer, licensed physicians and nurses on-site |
| **Business Model** | All-inclusive luxury medical facility, $5,000+/week |
| **Duration** | Operating since 2015, 10+ years track record |

**Critical Learnings from Rythmia:**
1. Licensing IS possible with proper legal navigation
2. Plant selection and terminology matters (avoid "DMT" in any official context)
3. Medical framework + traditional medicine integration is the accepted model
4. Long-term relationship with Ministry of Health is essential
5. Significant legal counsel investment required upfront

### 3.3 Legal Risks & Enforcement

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **DMT prosecution** | 8-15 years imprisonment possible under Law #8204 | Proper licensing, plant-based framing, legal counsel |
| **Unlicensed operation** | Facility closure, fines, criminal liability | Full licensing before any plant medicine offerings |
| **Patient death** | Criminal investigation, massive liability | Medical protocols, screening, emergency procedures |
| **Regulatory change** | Laws could tighten (as happened with psilocybin in 2020) | Diversified modality offering, not solely dependent on plant medicine |
| **Community opposition** | Political pressure on municipality | Community engagement, local hiring, low profile |

### 3.4 Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (Opening):** Launch as luxury bio-optimization / wellness retreat — NO plant medicine
**Phase 2 (6-12 months):** Pursue Ministry of Health + IAFA licensing for plant medicine
**Phase 3 (Licensed):** Introduce plant medicine program under full medical/legal framework
**Parallel:** Ibogaine offered ONLY if legal clarity achieved through dedicated legal counsel

### 3.5 Key Legal Contacts Needed

| Role | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Plant Medicine Regulatory Attorney** | Navigate Ministry of Health licensing pathway | Critical |
| **IAFA Liaison Counsel** | Treatment center accreditation | High |
| **Rythmia Legal Analysis** | Understand their licensing structure (public filings, corporate records) | High |
| **Criminal Defense Counsel** | Contingency preparedness | Medium |

## 6. Employment & Labor Law {#6-employment}

### 6.1 Social Charges (Cargas Sociales)

Costa Rica has mandatory social security contributions — this is one of the highest employer cost burdens in Latin America:

| Contribution | Employer % | Employee % | Total |
|-------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **CCSS Health Insurance** | 9.25% | 5.50% | 14.75% |
| **CCSS Pension (IVM)** | 5.08% | 4.00% | 9.08% |

## 8. Corporate Structure {#8-corporate-structure}

### 8.1 Recommended Structure

```
[Foreign Parent Entity / Individual]
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
[CR S.A. #1]  [CR S.A. #2]
Property      Operations
Holding       Company
    │              │
  Land +        Business
  Buildings     License,
               Staff,
               Revenue
```

**Rationale:**
- Separate property holding from operations for liability protection
- Property S.A. can be majority foreign-owned (for titled land)
- Operations S.A. holds all permits, contracts, employees
- If ZMT concession involved, property entity needs >50% Costa Rican ownership
