# Costa Rica Property Evaluation Framework

> *Systematic Criteria for Treatment Facility Location Selection — Guanacaste / Nicoya Peninsula*

---

## Purpose

This framework provides a structured methodology for evaluating specific properties in Costa Rica's Guanacaste and Nicoya Peninsula regions for the Transformational Epicenter facility. Each property is scored across 10 categories totaling 100 points, with compliance flags (traffic light system) replacing hard pass/fail gates. All properties are scored regardless of flag status — compliance gaps are highlighted for planning, not used as automatic disqualifiers.

---

## Part 1: Compliance Flags (9 Gates — Traffic Light System)

Instead of pass/fail disqualification, each gate receives a traffic light:
- 🟢 **GREEN** — Compliant, meets requirement
- 🟡 **YELLOW** — Partial compliance, achievable with investment/effort
- 🔴 **RED** — Non-compliant, significant challenge (NOT auto-DQ — score and note)

| Gate | Requirement | Verification Method | Flag | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------------|------|-------|
| **G1: Hospital Access** | Quality hospital reachable within 45 minutes | Google Maps + physical drive test | | |
| **G2: Cardiac Capability** | Hospital has cardiac catheterization or advanced cardiac care | Hospital verification call | | |
| **G3: Minimum Capacity** | ≥5 existing bedrooms OR space for 10+ guest rooms | Property inspection | | |
| **G4: Zoning** | Permits hospitality, wellness, or medical use | Municipal/cantonal zoning verification | | |
| **G5: Security Zone** | Not in elevated crime zone; safe for international guests | Local assessment + embassy guidance | | |
| **G6: Legal Title** | Clear titled land (not ZMT concession) OR viable concession path | Legal counsel review | | |
| **G7: Utilities** | Reliable power, water, internet available | ICE/CNFL verification + Starlink check | | |
| **G8: Access Road** | Ambulance-accessible road, passable in rainy season | Physical inspection (dry + wet season) | | |
| **G9: Structural Integrity** | Building structurally sound for conversion; seismic code compliant | Engineer assessment (Colegio de Ingenieros) | | |

**Flag Summary Guide:**
- All 🟢 = Proceed confidently
- Any 🟡 = Score fully, note remediation path and cost in evaluation
- Any 🔴 = Score fully, flag as major consideration in recommendation

**Key Differences from Mexico Framework:**
- G1 expanded to 45 min (Costa Rica's dispersed medical infrastructure)
- G6 addresses titled land vs. ZMT concession (replaces fideicomiso)
- G8 emphasizes rainy season passability (critical in Nicoya Peninsula)
- G9 includes seismic compliance (Costa Rica is seismically active)

## Part 2: Scoring Categories (100 Points Total)

### Category 1: Medical Infrastructure Access (20 Points)

*Critical for ibogaine safety and emergency response. Costa Rica's medical infrastructure is concentrated in San Jose (2+ hours from Guanacaste coast), with Liberia providing intermediate care.*

| Criterion | Points | Scoring Guide |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **1.1 Primary Hospital Distance** | 0-8 | |
| - Quality hospital ≤20 min | 8 | Liberia Hospital, CIMA Guanacaste |
| - Quality hospital 20-30 min | 6 | |
| - Quality hospital 30-45 min | 4 | |
| - Quality hospital 45-60 min | 2 | Common for Santa Teresa/Nosara |
| - Quality hospital >60 min | 0 | Flag but still score |
| **1.2 Secondary Hospital/Clinic** | 0-4 | |
| - Quality clinic ≤15 min | 4 | Cobano clinic, Santa Teresa clinics |
| - Quality clinic 15-25 min | 3 | |
| - Quality clinic 25-35 min | 2 | |
| - Quality clinic >35 min | 1 | |
| - None accessible | 0 | |
| **1.3 Ambulance Response** | 0-4 | |
| - Red Cross/EMS ≤10 min | 4 | Cruz Roja station nearby |
| - Red Cross/EMS 10-15 min | 3 | |
| - Red Cross/EMS 15-25 min | 2 | |
| - Red Cross/EMS >25 min | 1 | |
| **1.4 Air Evacuation Access** | 0-4 | |
| - Helipad on-site or ≤5 min | 4 | |
| - Landing zone ≤15 min or airstrip ≤20 min | 3 | Tambor (TMU), Nosara (NOB) |
| - Landing zone ≤25 min | 2 | |
| - Difficult air evacuation | 0 | |

**Category 1 Total: ___/20**

**Costa Rica Medical Context:**
- **JCI-accredited hospitals** are in San Jose only (CIMA, Clinica Biblica)
- **Liberia Hospital (Hospital Enrique Baltodano Briceño)** is the main Guanacaste facility — basic cardiac care, not JCI
- **On-site medical capability** becomes more important than in Mexico due to distance from advanced hospitals
- **Air evacuation** to San Jose is a viable backup (helicopter ~45 min from Nicoya Peninsula to CIMA)
- **Strategy:** Enhanced on-site medical team + air evacuation agreement can compensate for hospital distance

---

**Category 2 Total: ___/15**

**Costa Rica Access Context:**
- **LIR (Liberia)** — Main international airport for Guanacaste, direct flights from US/Canada
- **SJO (San Jose)** — Largest airport, more flight options but 4-5 hours to Santa Teresa
- **Tambor (TMU)** — Small domestic strip on Nicoya Peninsula, Sansa Airlines
- **Nosara (NOB)** — Small domestic strip, Sansa Airlines
- **Ferry:** Puntarenas-Paquera ferry is key route for Santa Teresa access from SJO (~1 hour crossing)

### Tier 1 — Priority Areas

| Area | Pros | Cons | Hospital Access | Property Availability |
|------|------|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Santa Teresa / Mal Pais** | World-class surf, growing luxury market, spiritual vibe, privacy possible on hillsides | Remote access (3-5 hrs from SJO), unpaved roads, dry season water stress | Cobano clinic 20-30 min; Liberia 3+ hrs; Tambor airstrip for air evac | Moderate — several boutique hotels for sale |
| **Nosara** | Established yoga/wellness hub, strong expat community, domestic airstrip | Expensive, some overdevelopment, 2.5+ hrs from LIR | NOB airstrip for air evac; local clinics; Liberia 2.5 hrs | Good — active hotel market |

### Tier 2 — Strong Contenders

| Area | Pros | Cons | Hospital Access | Property Availability |
|------|------|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Samara / Carrillo** | Authentic, safer roads, good value, friendly community | Less luxury market, less "wow factor" | Nicoya hospital 45 min; Liberia 2 hrs | Limited |
| **Playa Grande / Las Catalinas** | Premium planned community, walkable, excellent infrastructure | Very small market, high prices, less spiritual feel | Liberia 1 hr | Very limited |
| **Tamarindo** | Best infrastructure in Guanacaste coast, most flights, services | Too touristy, party reputation, less aligned with brand | Liberia 1 hr; local clinics | Good — many hotels for sale |

### Tier 3 — Worth Investigating

| Area | Pros | Cons | Hospital Access | Property Availability |
|------|------|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Montezuma / Cabuya** | Bohemian, very cheap, beautiful waterfalls, extreme privacy | Very remote, minimal infrastructure, tiny market | Cobano clinic 15-30 min; very limited | Very limited |
| **Nicoya Inland** | Blue Zone, authentic, incredibly affordable, longevity positioning | Zero tourism infrastructure, very basic, no ocean | Nicoya hospital on-site; Liberia 1.5 hrs | Must build — no hotel inventory |
| **Papagayo Peninsula** | Ultra-luxury corridor (Four Seasons, Andaz), best infrastructure | Extremely expensive, corporate feel, less authentic | Liberia 30 min; best medical access | Rare — high price point |

### Avoid for This Project

| Area | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Central Pacific (Jaco/Manuel Antonio)** | Wrong coast for Blue Zone narrative, party town (Jaco), over-touristed |
| **Caribbean Coast** | Isolated from Guanacaste medical/airport infrastructure, different culture |
