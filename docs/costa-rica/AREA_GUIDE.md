## Medical Access Overview

Understanding hospital access is critical. Unlike Quintana Roo (where JCI hospitals are within 30 minutes), Costa Rica's best hospitals are in San Jose, 3-5 hours from the coast.

### Hospital Network

| Hospital | Location | Level | Drive from Santa Teresa | Drive from Nosara | Drive from Tamarindo |
|----------|----------|-------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Hospital CIMA** | San Jose | JCI-accredited, full cardiac | 5 hrs | 4.5 hrs | 4 hrs |
| **Clinica Biblica** | San Jose | Full-service private | 5 hrs | 4.5 hrs | 4 hrs |
| **Hospital Metropolitano** | San Jose | Full-service private | 5 hrs | 4.5 hrs | 4 hrs |
| **Hospital Liberia** | Liberia | CCSS public, emergency + basic cardiac | 3.5 hrs | 2.5 hrs | 1 hr |
| **Clinica CIMA Guanacaste** | Liberia | Private clinic, expanding | 3.5 hrs | 2.5 hrs | 1 hr |
| **Hospital La Anexión** | Nicoya | CCSS public, general emergency | 2 hrs | 1 hr | 1.5 hrs |
| **Cobano Health Clinic** | Cobano | EBAIS basic clinic | 25 min | 2 hrs | 3 hrs |
| **Santa Teresa Clinic** | Santa Teresa | Basic private clinic | 5 min | 2.5 hrs | 3.5 hrs |

### Air Evacuation Strategy

Given the distance from advanced hospitals, air evacuation is the critical backup:

| Route | Method | Time | Cost (est.) |
|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| Santa Teresa → CIMA San Jose | Helicopter | ~50 min | $8,000-15,000/flight |
| Nosara → CIMA San Jose | Helicopter | ~45 min | $8,000-15,000/flight |
| Tambor (TMU) → SJO | Fixed-wing air ambulance | ~30 min | $5,000-10,000 |
| Nosara (NOB) → SJO | Fixed-wing air ambulance | ~35 min | $5,000-10,000 |
| Any → Liberia Hospital | Ground ambulance | Variable | Cruz Roja service |

**Key Insight:** The medical strategy for any Costa Rica location must include:
1. Enhanced on-site medical team (physician, nurse, emergency equipment)
2. On-site cardiac monitoring capability (at minimum portable ECG, defibrillator, crash cart)
3. Air evacuation contract with helicopter/air ambulance service
4. Transfer agreement with CIMA San Jose and/or Clinica Biblica
5. Cruz Roja (Red Cross) notification protocol

## 4. Samara / Carrillo

**Municipality:** Nicoya Canton
**GPS Center:** 9.8816° N, 85.5281° W

### Overview

Samara is a charming, mid-market beach town that maintains authentic Costa Rican character. Playa Carrillo, just south, is consistently rated one of Costa Rica's most beautiful beaches. The area is quieter and more family-oriented than Tamarindo or Nosara.

### Pros

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Authentic feel** | Real Costa Rican town, not overrun by tourism |
| **Good value** | Significantly cheaper than Nosara or Santa Teresa |
| **Beautiful beaches** | Playa Carrillo is a postcard-perfect crescent bay |
| **Safer roads** | Better road access than Santa Teresa (Route 150 paved to Nicoya) |
| **Domestic airstrip** | Carrillo has a small airstrip (limited service) |
| **Community** | Friendly local community, some expats |

### Cons

| Challenge | Detail | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|

| **Limited property inventory** | Fewer hotels for sale than Santa Teresa or Tamarindo | Medium |
| **Medical access** | Nicoya hospital 45 min; Liberia 2 hrs | Medium |

## 5. Playa Grande / Las Catalinas

**Municipality:** Santa Cruz Canton
**GPS Center:** 10.3431° N, 85.8574° W

### Overview

Playa Grande is a laid-back surf beach adjacent to Las Baulas National Park (leatherback turtle nesting). Las Catalinas is a unique planned, car-free community modeled on European walking villages, developed by a US investor.

### Pros

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Las Catalinas quality** | World-class planned community with premium infrastructure |
| **Nature preserve** | Adjacent to national park; sea turtles, wildlife |
| **LIR proximity** | ~1 hour from Liberia airport |
| **Premium positioning** | Attracts sophisticated, wellness-oriented visitors |
| **Infrastructure** | Las Catalinas has excellent infrastructure (water, power, fiber) |

### Cons

| Challenge | Detail | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Very limited inventory** | Few properties for sale; Las Catalinas tightly controlled | High |
| **Expensive** | Premium pricing in Las Catalinas ($500K+ for small units) | High |
| **Restrictive covenants** | Las Catalinas has strict design/use guidelines | High |
| **Small scale** | Limited expansion potential | Medium |
| **National Park restrictions** | Building restrictions near Las Baulas | Medium |

### Real Estate Market

| Metric | Range |
|--------|-------|
| **Las Catalinas properties** | $1M-$8M (mostly residential) |
| **Playa Grande boutique hotel** | $800K-$3M (very rare) |
| **Land** | $100-300/m² (limited) |

**Assessment:** Premium location and infrastructure, but Las Catalinas' controlled environment may not accommodate a treatment facility. Playa Grande itself has limited inventory. Worth monitoring but unlikely to yield suitable candidates.

## 6. Montezuma / Cabuya

**Municipality:** Cóbano District, Puntarenas Canton
**GPS Center:** 9.6565° N, 85.0690° W

### Overview

Montezuma is a bohemian beach village known for its waterfalls, artsy community, and extreme remoteness. Cabuya is even more remote, near the tip of the Nicoya Peninsula and the Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve.

### Pros

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Extremely affordable** | Lowest prices on the peninsula |
| **Maximum privacy** | Very remote, low density, jungle-covered |
| **Waterfalls** | Montezuma Waterfalls are iconic, healing environment |
| **Cabo Blanco proximity** | Adjacent to Costa Rica's first nature reserve |
| **Bohemian character** | Artistic, alternative community |

### Cons

| Challenge | Detail | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Extremely remote** | 4+ hours from LIR; worst access on peninsula | Very High |
| **Minimal infrastructure** | Very basic services, limited power reliability | High |
| **Medical desert** | Cobano clinic 15-30 min but extremely basic; Nicoya 2+ hrs | Very High |
| **Tiny market** | Very few visitors compared to Santa Teresa | High |
| **Road access** | Some of the worst roads in the region | High |
| **Property inventory** | Almost nothing suitable on the market | High |

**Assessment:** Too remote for a medical treatment facility. The medical access challenge alone would require extraordinary on-site capability. Not recommended unless a transformational property appears.

---

## 7. Papagayo Peninsula

**Municipality:** Liberia Canton / Carrillo Canton
**GPS Center:** 10.6500° N, 85.7000° W

### Overview

The Papagayo Peninsula is home to Costa Rica's ultra-luxury corridor: Four Seasons, Andaz, Rosewood (under development), and the exclusive Prieta community. This is the most developed and infrastructure-rich area on the Guanacaste coast.

### Pros

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Ultra-luxury positioning** | Four Seasons, Andaz, world-class golf |
| **Best infrastructure** | Private roads, reliable utilities, fiber internet, water treatment |
| **Best medical access** | Liberia hospital 25-35 min; private clinics nearby |

| **Less authentic** | Resort corridor, not "pura vida" | Medium |

### Real Estate Market

| **Existing hotel/resort** | $10M-$50M+ |
| **Luxury home** | $3M-$15M |
| **Land (within developments)** | $300-1,000/m² |

**Assessment:** Best infrastructure and medical access, but price point and corporate development restrictions make this challenging. Could serve as aspirational benchmark or future expansion target. Not practical for initial facility.

## 8. Nicoya Inland (Blue Zone)

**Municipality:** Nicoya Canton
**GPS Center:** 10.1451° N, 85.4520° W (Nicoya town)

### Overview

The town of Nicoya and surrounding rural communities represent the heart of the Nicoya Peninsula Blue Zone — one of only five certified Blue Zones worldwide where people routinely live past 100. The area is authentically Costa Rican, inland, agricultural, and completely untouched by tourism.

### Pros

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Blue Zone** | One of 5 worldwide; unmatched longevity positioning |
| **Hospital in Nicoya** | Hospital La Anexión provides basic to moderate emergency care |
| **Incredibly affordable** | Property at 20-30% of coastal prices |
| **Authentic culture** | True pura vida; traditional diet, community, lifestyle |
| **Research potential** | Blue Zone research partnerships possible (National Geographic, etc.) |
| **Road access** | Route 21 paved to Nicoya; better access than coastal areas |

### Cons

| Challenge | Detail | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **No tourism infrastructure** | Zero hotels for international wellness market | Very High |
| **No ocean** | Inland location; no beach, no surf, no ocean views | High |
| **Must build** | No existing hotel inventory to purchase | High |
| **Limited appeal** | Harder to market inland location to luxury clientele | High |
| **Basic services** | Small-town amenities only | Medium |
| **LIR distance** | 1.5 hrs from Liberia airport | Medium |

### Real Estate Market

| Metric | Range |
|--------|-------|
| **Agricultural land** | $5-20/m² |
| **Residential** | $300-800/m² built |
| **Hotel inventory** | None suitable |

**Assessment:** The Blue Zone positioning is uniquely powerful for brand narrative, but the practical challenges are significant. Best used as a **day-trip/excursion component** from a coastal facility rather than primary location. A "Blue Zone Immersion" day program from a Santa Teresa or Nosara base would capture the narrative without the infrastructure challenges.

## Strategic Recommendation

### Primary Target: Santa Teresa / Mal Pais

**Why:** Best combination of brand alignment, property availability, natural beauty, privacy potential, and value. The wellness/spiritual positioning is already established. The remoteness — while an infrastructure challenge — is a feature for UHNW clients seeking privacy and disconnection.

**Medical Strategy:** Enhanced on-site medical team + air evacuation agreement + Tambor (TMU) airstrip for fixed-wing evacuation. Consider investing in on-site helipad.

### Secondary Target: Nosara

**Why:** Established wellness reputation, domestic airstrip (critical for both guest access and medical evacuation), strong community, slightly better infrastructure than Santa Teresa.

**Medical Strategy:** NOB airstrip is a significant advantage for air evacuation. Combined with on-site medical team, this partially compensates for hospital distance.

### Hub-and-Spoke Consideration

A dual-strategy could maximize strengths:
- **Primary facility:** Santa Teresa or Nosara (luxury treatment center, 10-15 rooms)
- **Liberia medical hub:** Small medical liaison office near Liberia Hospital for emergency support, staff medical checks, supply logistics
- **Blue Zone excursions:** Day programs to Nicoya inland for longevity immersion component
- **Airport logistics:** Dedicated ground transport from LIR to facility (professional driver, luxury vehicle)

### Areas to Deprioritize

- **Tamarindo** — Strong infrastructure but wrong brand positioning. Best as logistics/support hub
- **Papagayo** — Price point and restrictions make it impractical
- **Montezuma** — Too remote even by Costa Rica standards
- **Nicoya Inland** — Excursion component only, not primary facility

---

## Seasonal Considerations

| Season | Months | Impact on Operations |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Dry Season (High)** | Dec-Apr | Peak tourism, best weather, water scarcity, dusty unpaved roads |
| **Green Season (Low)** | May-Nov | Lower prices, lush vegetation, rain (afternoons usually), some road issues, water abundant |
| **Shoulder** | May, Nov-Dec | Transition periods, good value |

**Operational Strategy:**
- Market dry season as premium (higher rates, outdoor-focused programming)
- Green season as intimate/introspective (lower rates, indoor-focused, plant medicine ceremonies)
- Year-round operations are viable — rain is typically afternoon thunderstorms, not all-day
