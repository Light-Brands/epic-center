## Who We're Talking To

**Primary buyer:** The CEO or founder of a business doing $10M-$50M in revenue who needs to raise institutional capital ($5M-$100M+) and has never done it at this level before -- or has done it badly and knows there's a better way.

**Secondary influencers:** CFO (cares about the model and valuation), COO (cares about operational documentation and not getting buried in vendor coordination), and any advisors or board members pushing the founder toward "getting serious" about the raise.

**The profile that converts:**
- Revenue between $10M-$50M, real business, real traction
- Raising $5M-$100M+ for growth, expansion, or acquisition
- Has tried assembling fundraising materials themselves or with fragmented vendors
- Feels the gap between "good business" and "investable business"
- Time-pressured -- needs capital soon, can't afford a 12-month process
- Willing to invest in doing it right rather than patching it together

## The Core Message (Say This)

**One sentence:**
We deliver a complete fundraising operating system -- strategy, financials, legal architecture, market research, investor platform, and data room -- in 14-30 days, replacing the 8+ vendors and 6-12 months it normally takes.

**The sharper version for conversation:**
"You're running a $30M business and you need to raise capital. Right now you're looking at hiring a strategy firm, a law firm, tax advisors, financial modelers, market researchers, a web agency, and probably an investment bank. That's $1.5M-$3M and 6-12 months before you sit down with a single investor. We do the entire thing -- 150+ documents, a live investor platform, institutional-grade financial models, a full data room -- in 30 days or less. One team, one engagement, one invoice."

## The Three Pain Points That Open Every Conversation

Use these as openers. Each one is a door into the sale.

### 1. "It costs millions to raise millions"

The brutal paradox of institutional fundraising. To raise $10M-$50M, a founder typically needs to spend $1.5M-$3M+ across 8+ separate firms -- before a single dollar comes in. Most founders don't know this until they're deep in the process and bleeding cash. We compress that entire spend into a fixed-price engagement at a fraction of the cost.

**Say:** "What have you budgeted for your fundraise infrastructure? Most founders we talk to haven't -- because nobody told them the real number."

### 2. "It takes 6-12 months before you're even ready"

Strategy firm delivers in month 3. Law firm in month 5. Financial model in month 7. Web platform in month 9. Nothing is cross-referenced. The CEO becomes the project manager of their own raise, reconciling contradictory documents from vendors who never spoke to each other. Meanwhile, the market window is closing and cash is burning.

**Say:** "How long have you been working on getting raise-ready? And how much longer can you afford to wait?"

### 3. "One inconsistency kills the deal"

Investor trust is binary. You either look institutional-grade or you don't. One number in the pitch that doesn't match the financial model, one claim in the strategy doc that contradicts the market research, one missing document in the data room -- and the investor passes. They won't tell you why. They'll just go quiet. Our materials are cross-referenced end-to-end because they're built by one team, in one engagement, from one source of truth.

**Say:** "When an investor asks to see your data room tomorrow, what do you send them?"

## What We're Really Selling (The Emotional Layer)

The rational argument (faster, cheaper, better) gets the meeting. The emotional argument closes the deal. Know which one you're making at each stage.

| What They Say They Want | What They Actually Want |
|---|---|
| A pitch deck and financial model | To feel confident walking into any investor meeting |
| A faster process | To stop the anxiety of a raise that drags on with no end in sight |
| Better materials | To never again feel outclassed by companies with Goldman-level presentations |
| Lower cost | To stop bleeding cash on vendors before the raise even starts |
| A data room | To never scramble when an investor says "send us your diligence package" |
| Help with structure | To stop lying awake wondering if they set up the entity wrong |
| Market research | To have the proof that their gut instinct about the market is right |

**The single deepest driver:** These are people who built a real business from nothing. They know their product, their market, their customers. But the fundraising world makes them feel like outsiders -- like they don't speak the language. We give them fluency overnight.

## How to Position by Role

### To a CEO/Founder
Lead with **time and narrative**. They don't have 12 months. They need a compelling story that makes investors lean in -- not a stack of disconnected documents. Emphasize that we build the strategic narrative that ties everything together, and we do it in 30 days.

**Key phrase:** "You get back to running your business. We build your raise."

### To a CFO
Lead with **model credibility and valuation**. Their internal financials are operational tools, not investor instruments. Our 12-tab model with scenario analysis, sensitivity matrices, and IPEV-compliant valuation is what institutions expect. They can stress-test it live.

**Key phrase:** "Your numbers are solid. We make them investor-grade."

### To a COO
Lead with **coordination relief and operational documentation**. Every vendor the CEO hires for the raise creates work for the COO. We eliminate that entirely. One team, one point of contact, one deliverable. Plus, we document their operations in a way that proves to investors the business scales beyond the founders.

**Key phrase:** "You won't manage a single vendor. And your operational story will be on paper for the first time."

### To Board Members/Advisors
Lead with **risk reduction and institutional credibility**. They're the ones pushing the founder to "get serious." They want to see materials that would hold up in any boardroom. They've seen raises fail because of amateur materials and they don't want to watch it happen again.

**Key phrase:** "This is the infrastructure a $500M company would have. Your portfolio company gets it in 30 days."

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We already have a pitch deck" | "A pitch deck is 1% of what institutional investors evaluate. We build the other 99% -- the financial model, the data room, the legal structure, the market research, and the live investor platform that makes the pitch deck irrelevant." |
| "That's expensive" | "Compared to what? Assembling this piecemeal costs $1.5M-$3M and takes 6-12 months. We deliver the same scope in 30 days at a fraction of the cost. And if upfront cash is the concern, we have structures where you pay as little as 15% now and the rest from your raise proceeds." |
| "We can build this ourselves" | "You could. It'll take your team 6-12 months, pull your CEO and CFO away from running the business, and you'll still need to hire lawyers, tax advisors, and financial modelers. The question is whether your time is better spent raising capital or building the infrastructure to raise capital." |
| "How do we know it'll work?" | "We built this entire platform for a real venture raising real capital. Every deliverable is battle-tested. We'll show you a live platform and actual deliverables from a completed engagement before you commit." |
| "We're not ready to raise yet" | "That's exactly when to start. The companies that raise fastest are the ones that had their infrastructure ready before they needed it. Building raise-ready materials while you still have runway is a strategic advantage -- not a premature move." |
| "We already have lawyers and accountants" | "Good -- keep them. We don't replace your legal counsel or your CPA. We build the fundraising-specific layer they don't: the strategic narrative, the investor-grade financial model, the market intelligence, the interactive platform, and the organized data room. Your lawyers review our structure docs. Your accountants validate our model inputs. We make their jobs easier, not redundant." |

## Pricing at a Glance (For Conversations)

Don't lead with price. Lead with scope and pain. When pricing comes up, frame it against the alternative.

| Raise Target | Our Price | What It Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| $5M | $75K | $500K-$1M+ in assembled vendor costs |
| $10M | $200K | $1M-$2M+ in assembled vendor costs |
| $25M | $450K | $2M-$3M+ in assembled vendor costs |
| $50M | $600K | $3M+ in assembled vendor costs |

**If upfront cash is a concern**, introduce the Confidence Model (30% upfront, 70% after raise) or the Founder's Bet (15% upfront, deferred fee after raise -- by invitation only). These exist specifically to eliminate the "spend money to raise money" barrier.

---

## The Line That Closes

Every conversation should build toward one realization:

> "The distance between 'good business' and 'investable business' is enormous -- and it doesn't have to take a year and cost millions to close that gap."

That's the sale. Everything else is supporting evidence.
