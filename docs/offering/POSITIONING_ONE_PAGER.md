## Who We Are (The Positioning)

Light Brands is a full-spectrum strategic consulting firm for growth-stage businesses doing $10M-$50M+ in revenue. We deliver the same caliber of strategic advisory, financial architecture, market intelligence, operational design, and technology infrastructure that McKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, and PwC deliver to Fortune 500 companies -- but built for the speed, stakes, and constraints of businesses scaling through Series A and beyond.

**The difference:** The Big 4 charge $2M-$5M, take 6-12 months, and hand you a PowerPoint. We deliver working systems -- live platforms, functional financial models, documented operations, investor-ready infrastructure -- in 14-30 days. We don't advise. We build.

**Why this positioning is credible:** We built a complete fundraising operating system for a real venture raising institutional capital -- 150+ documents, a 30-page interactive investor platform, a 12-tab institutional-grade financial model, a 20+ document data room, multi-jurisdiction tax and legal architecture, competitive intelligence across 50+ companies, global expansion research across 30+ markets -- all cross-referenced end-to-end and delivered in weeks. That's not a claim. That's a live, walkable proof of concept any prospect can see before they sign.

## What We Do (The Eight Practice Areas)

We operate across eight integrated practice areas. Most engagements touch three to five. The fundraising platform showcases all eight working together.

| Practice Area | What We Deliver | Big 4 Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| **Strategic Advisory** | Master strategic plans, go-to-market strategy, competitive positioning, executive narratives, vision architecture | McKinsey/BCG strategy engagement |
| **Capital Strategy** | Raise infrastructure, investor platforms, data rooms, pitch architecture, capital structure design | Goldman/Morgan Stanley capital markets advisory |
| **Financial Architecture** | Variable-driven financial models, IPEV-compliant valuations, scenario analysis, cap table modeling, unit economics | PwC/Deloitte financial advisory |
| **Market Intelligence** | 50+ competitor profiles, TAM/SAM/SOM, geographic scoring, pricing benchmarks, trend analysis, regulatory mapping | Bain/BCG market research practice |
| **Operational Design** | SOPs, staffing models, service delivery protocols, scaling blueprints, program architecture | McKinsey operations practice |
| **Technology & Digital** | AI systems, white-label platforms, interactive web applications, digital ecosystems, HIPAA-compliant infrastructure | Accenture/Deloitte Digital |
| **Tax & Legal Architecture** | Multi-entity structuring, jurisdiction optimization, governance frameworks, board documentation, founder guides | PwC/EY tax and legal advisory |
| **Expansion & Growth Strategy** | Global market scoring, site evaluation, infrastructure assessment, risk analysis, implementation roadmaps | BCG/McKinsey expansion practice |

**The key insight for the team:** We don't sell practice areas individually in conversation. We sell outcomes. The practice areas are the proof that we can deliver the outcome.

## Who We Serve

**The client:** CEOs, founders, and leadership teams of businesses doing $10M-$50M+ in revenue who are at inflection points -- raising capital, scaling operations, entering new markets, professionalizing for institutional scrutiny, or preparing for a liquidity event.

**The stage:** Post-product-market-fit, pre-institutional maturity. They've built something real. Revenue is growing. But the infrastructure around the business -- the strategy documentation, the financial models, the operational systems, the market intelligence, the digital presence, the legal architecture -- hasn't kept pace with the revenue.

**The profile that converts:**
- Revenue $10M-$50M+, real business, real customers, real growth
- At an inflection point: raising capital, expanding, hiring a leadership team, preparing for a board
- Running on founder intuition and tribal knowledge -- it works, but it doesn't scale and it doesn't impress institutional stakeholders
- Has been quoted $2M+ and 6-12 months by traditional consulting firms, or has been burned by piecemeal vendor engagements that didn't connect
- Moves fast and expects their partners to move faster

**Common inflection points where they find us:**
- Series A or growth round preparation
- Board or investor pressure to "professionalize"
- New market entry or geographic expansion
- Post-acquisition integration
- Operational scaling beyond founder-led execution
- First institutional hire (CFO, COO, VP)

## The Core Message

**One sentence:**
Light Brands delivers Big 4-caliber strategic consulting -- strategy, finance, operations, market intelligence, technology, and legal architecture -- to growth-stage businesses in weeks, not quarters, at a fraction of traditional cost.

**The sharper version for conversation:**
"You're at $30M in revenue and you need to level up -- raise capital, scale operations, professionalize for institutional partners. The Big 4 will charge you $2M-$5M and take 6-12 months to hand you a strategy deck. We'll build you a complete operating system -- strategy, financials, market intelligence, operations blueprint, live digital platforms, investor-ready data room -- in 30 days. And we don't hand you recommendations. We hand you working infrastructure."

**When they ask "how is that possible":**
"We've built an AI-augmented delivery model that lets a small, senior team produce the same depth and breadth of output that a Big 4 firm needs 30 consultants and 9 months to deliver. Not faster because it's shallow. Faster because the methodology is better."

## The Proof Point: The Fundraising Platform

This is the showcase. When a prospect asks "show me what you've done," this is what we walk them through.

**What we built for a single engagement:**

| Deliverable | Scale |
|---|---|
| Strategic documents | 150+ files, 550,000+ words, 1,100+ pages |
| Interactive investor platform | 30+ pages, 25,000+ lines of production code (Next.js) |
| Financial model | 12-tab variable-driven Google Sheets model with linked projections, scenario toggles, and assumption-driven cascading |
| Data room | 20+ documents, organized, gated, investor-ready |
| Market research | 50+ competitor profiles across 4 industries, TAM/SAM/SOM, geographic intelligence across 30+ locations |
| Tax & legal architecture | Multi-entity, multi-jurisdiction structuring with governance docs |
| Expansion research | Global market scoring, site evaluation frameworks, regulatory analysis |
| Operational blueprint | SOPs, staffing models, program architecture, service delivery protocols |
| Design system | Brand guidelines, color tokens, typography, component library |

**Delivered in weeks. Not months. Not quarters.**

**How to use this in conversation:** Don't lead with the fundraising platform. Lead with whatever the prospect's actual pain is -- scaling, capital, operations, market entry. Then, when they push back on whether you can actually deliver, bring up the platform as proof. "Let me show you what we built for a single engagement. You can click through a live platform, open the financial model, browse the data room. Every document cross-references every other document. This is what 30 days looks like."

## The Five Pain Points That Open Every Conversation

### 1. "We've outgrown our infrastructure"

The business is at $20M, $30M, $40M -- but the strategy is in the founder's head, the financials are in QuickBooks, the operations run on tribal knowledge, and the "data room" is a messy Google Drive. Every institutional stakeholder -- investors, board members, potential acquirers, strategic partners -- sees this gap immediately.

**Say:** "Your revenue says $30M. What does your infrastructure say?"

### 2. "The Big 4 quoted us $2M and 9 months"

They've talked to McKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, or PwC. The proposal came back at $2M-$5M, a 6-12 month timeline, and a team of 15-30 junior consultants who will need to "learn the business" for the first 8 weeks. For a $30M company, that math doesn't work. The engagement costs more than the problem it solves.

**Say:** "What did they quote you? And how long before they said you'd see the first deliverable?"

### 3. "We need to raise capital but we're not raise-ready"

Series A and growth rounds require institutional-grade materials -- strategy narratives, financial models investors can stress-test, organized data rooms, defensible market sizing, legal structure that holds up to diligence. Most $10M-$50M companies have none of this. The gap between "good business" and "investable business" is enormous, and nobody tells founders that until they're already in front of investors.

**Say:** "If a top-tier investor said 'send me everything' tomorrow, what would you send?"

### 4. "We hired five vendors and nothing connects"

They've got a strategy firm, a law firm, a financial modeler, a market researcher, and a web agency. Each one delivered their piece in isolation over different timelines. Nothing cross-references. The numbers in the pitch don't match the financial model. The market sizing doesn't match the strategy doc. The CEO is spending 20 hours a week reconciling contradictory materials from vendors who never spoke to each other.

**Say:** "How many firms are you currently managing for this? And who's making sure it all tells the same story?"

### 5. "We're moving too fast for traditional consulting"

Growth-stage businesses operate on weeks, not quarters. By the time a Big 4 engagement delivers its first working session, the market has moved. These founders need partners who match their speed -- who can go from kickoff to deliverable in the same timeframe it takes a traditional firm to schedule the discovery phase.

**Say:** "What's your timeline? Because ours is 30 days from kickoff to complete deliverable."

## How to Position by Role

### To a CEO/Founder
Lead with **speed, credibility, and strategic narrative**. They need a partner who understands the whole picture -- not just one slice. They're tired of managing vendors who don't talk to each other. They want to walk into any room -- investor meeting, board meeting, partner negotiation -- and feel like the most prepared person at the table.

**Key phrase:** "We give you the same infrastructure a $500M company has. In 30 days. So you can get back to building."

### To a CFO
Lead with **financial architecture and institutional credibility**. Their internal financials run the business but don't impress institutions. They need investor-grade models, defensible valuations, scenario analysis, and cap table clarity. They also need tax and entity structure that doesn't unravel under diligence.

**Key phrase:** "We build the financial infrastructure your investors expect -- not the one your accounting firm can produce."

### To a COO
Lead with **operational documentation and scaling systems**. They know the operation works. But it lives in people's heads, not in documented systems. We put it on paper in a way that proves to investors, board members, and new hires that this business scales beyond the founding team. And we do it without creating 6 months of work for the ops team.

**Key phrase:** "We document what you've built so it scales without you holding everything together."

### To Board Members / Advisors / Investors
Lead with **risk reduction and portfolio acceleration**. They've seen companies stall because the infrastructure didn't match the revenue. They've seen raises fail because the materials were amateur. They want their portfolio companies to look institutional-grade, and they want it done fast.

**Key phrase:** "Your portfolio company is a $30M business operating on $3M infrastructure. We close that gap in 30 days."

## What We're Really Selling (The Emotional Layer)

| What They Say | What They Mean |
|---|---|
| "We need to professionalize" | "I'm terrified that a serious investor or acquirer will look under the hood and realize we're held together with duct tape" |
| "We need a strategy document" | "I need someone to articulate what I know intuitively but can't put on paper in a way that makes institutions take us seriously" |
| "We need a better financial model" | "I can't answer the questions a sophisticated investor asks, and it makes me feel like a fraud" |
| "We need help with our raise" | "I've been trying to do this for 8 months and I'm exhausted, behind schedule, and running out of runway" |
| "We need to scale operations" | "I'm the bottleneck. Everything runs through me. And I can't hire fast enough because I can't document what we do" |
| "We should talk to McKinsey" | "I want the credibility and comfort of a name-brand firm, but I'm not sure we can afford it or wait that long" |

**The single deepest driver:** These founders built a real business. They're proud of it. But every time they step outside their domain -- into investor meetings, board presentations, legal structuring, institutional conversations -- they feel outmatched. Not because they're not smart enough. Because they haven't had the infrastructure that makes their intelligence legible to the institutional world. We build that infrastructure.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We're already talking to McKinsey/Bain/Deloitte" | "Great -- ask them for a timeline and a deliverable list. Then ask us. We'll match their scope, beat their timeline by 6 months, and come in at a fraction of the cost. And we'll show you a live example of what we deliver before you sign anything." |
| "How can a small firm deliver Big 4-level work?" | "The Big 4 put 30 junior consultants on your project and charge you for the learning curve. We put senior people on your project and augment them with AI-powered delivery infrastructure that produces at a depth and speed no traditional team can match. The output speaks for itself -- we'll show you." |
| "That's still a significant investment" | "It is. But you're comparing it to zero, not to the alternative. The alternative is $2M-$5M at a Big 4, or $1.5M-$3M assembled piecemeal across 8 vendors over 12 months. Or you do nothing, and you walk into your next investor meeting with the same materials that haven't closed a round yet." |
| "We just need a financial model / pitch deck / data room" | "We can absolutely scope a single deliverable. But in our experience, the financial model that isn't connected to a strategy narrative, market research, and legal structure doesn't survive first contact with a sophisticated investor. The power is in the integration. That's what we do differently." |
| "Can you really do this in 30 days?" | "We've done it. We'll show you the platform, the documents, the model, the data room -- all built in a single engagement. The question isn't whether we can deliver. The question is whether you can afford to wait 9 more months for someone else to." |
| "We've been burned by consultants before" | "So has every founder at your stage. The difference is we don't hand you a strategy deck and disappear. We hand you working infrastructure -- live platforms, functional models, documented operations, organized data rooms. You can click through it, stress-test it, and hand it directly to investors. This isn't advice. It's a system." |
| "Why haven't I heard of you?" | "Because we've been building, not marketing. The firms you've heard of built their reputations over 50 years serving Fortune 500 companies. We built ours by delivering $3M+ worth of institutional infrastructure in 30 days for growth-stage businesses that the Big 4 are too slow and too expensive to serve. We'd rather show you the work than show you the brand." |

## Pricing Philosophy (For Conversations)

Never lead with price. Lead with scope, pain, and proof. When pricing comes up, always frame against the alternative -- never in isolation.

**The framing:**
"A comparable scope of work from the Big 4 runs $2M-$5M and takes 6-12 months. Assembling it piecemeal across specialized firms costs $1.5M-$3M+ and takes just as long. We deliver the same institutional-grade output in 14-30 days, starting at a fraction of those numbers."

**When they press for a number:**
"Our engagements range from $75K to $750K depending on scope and raise size. We'll scope it precisely after a discovery conversation -- but even at the top end, you're looking at 15-25% of what the traditional path costs, delivered in 5% of the time."

**If cash is a constraint**, introduce the flexible payment structures -- Confidence Model or Founder's Bet -- which allow the majority of the fee to be paid from raise proceeds. This eliminates the "spend money to raise money" paradox entirely.

---

## The Line That Closes

Every conversation should build toward one realization:

> "You built a $30M business without institutional infrastructure. Imagine what happens when you have it."

That's the sale. The fundraising platform is the proof. Everything else is context.
