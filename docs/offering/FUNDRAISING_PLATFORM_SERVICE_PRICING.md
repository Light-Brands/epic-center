## The Problem & The Offer

Founders raising institutional capital face a brutal paradox: you need to spend money to raise money and the infrastructure required to do it right is fragmented across an entire ecosystem of vendors.

A typical $3M-$10M raise requires engaging **8+ separate firms**: a strategy consultancy for positioning, a law firm for entity structuring, tax advisors for multi-jurisdiction optimization, financial modelers for projections, market researchers for competitive intelligence, a web agency for investor-facing digital assets, a design firm for brand identity, and an investment bank for deal packaging. Assembled piecemeal, this costs **$1.5M-$3M+** and takes **6-12 months** before a single dollar is raised.

We built the entire stack, 150+ documents, a live investor web platform, institutional-grade financial models, a 20+ document data room, and a complete design system, for a real venture raising real capital. Every deliverable is battle-tested, internally cross-referenced, and investor-ready.

**The offer:** We deliver a unified fundraising operating system, customized to your business, in **14 to 30 days, not 6-12 months**, at a fraction of the assembled cost.

---

### A. Strategic Foundation

**What it is:** The master strategic narrative that ties your entire raise together -- vision, go-to-market strategy, executive summary, and the master plan that connects every other deliverable.

**What's included:**
- Master strategic plan with phased execution roadmap
- Vision document articulating market positioning and long-term thesis
- Go-to-market strategy with channel analysis and customer acquisition
- Executive summary calibrated for institutional investors
- Market strategy plan with competitive positioning

**Market comparable:** McKinsey/Bain/BCG strategy engagements run **$500K-$2M** per project. Boutique strategy firms charge **$200K-$400K**. This covers the same deliverables: positioning, GTM, and investor narrative.

**Our price: $50K - $100K**

---

### B. Market Research & Intelligence

**What it is:** Multi-industry competitive intelligence covering your competitive landscape, pricing benchmarks, market sizing, geographic intelligence, and trend analysis.

**What's included:**

- Multi-industry market research (your sector and adjacent markets)
- Pricing analysis with tiered benchmarking
- Geographic intelligence and market accessibility scoring
- Cross-border demand and international market analysis

> Sources: MainBrain (research pricing), Drive Research (study costs), IBISWorld benchmarks

**Our price: $20K - $40K**

---

### C. Financial Models

**What it is:** A **12-tab variable-driven Google Sheets financial model** where every tab is linked, all projections are driven by adjustable assumption variables, and changing a single input cascades through revenue, P&L, cash flow, unit economics, sensitivity analysis, and investment returns in real time.

**What's included:**
- 12-tab integrated Google Sheets model (revenue, expenses, P&L, cash flow, unit economics, sensitivity analysis, cap table, investment returns, scenario comparisons, assumptions dashboard, and more)
- DCF analysis with multiple discount rate scenarios
- Sensitivity matrices across key variables
- Cap table modeling with dilution scenarios
- Break-even analysis and unit economics

> **This is not a collection of static CSV exports.** The deliverable is a living, institutional-grade model -- the kind a CFO or investment banker would build. Changing one assumption (occupancy rate, pricing, headcount, growth rate) cascades through every linked tab automatically. This is what separates a $10K "financial projection" from a **$75K-$150K institutional-grade model**.

**Market comparable:** Boutique investment banks and financial advisory firms charge **$50K-$150K+** for a fully linked, variable-driven multi-tab model. Big 4 transaction advisory services charge **$150K-$500K** when modeling is part of a broader engagement.

**Our price: $25K - $50K**

---

### D. 9-Point Enterprise Valuation Report

**What it is:** A standalone, institutional-grade enterprise valuation report that triangulates your company's worth through **9 independent IPEV-compliant valuation methods** -- weighted, cross-validated, and delivered as a single cohesive document that answers the question every investor asks first: *"What is this worth, and how did you get there?"*

This is not a back-of-napkin valuation or a single-method estimate. It is a comprehensive, multi-method analysis that would typically require a dedicated valuation team at a Big 4 firm working for 6-8 weeks. The report covers qualitative scoring methods, venture capital methods, and discounted cash flow methods -- each independently derived, then combined using a weighted framework that follows International Private Equity Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines.

**What's included:**

*9 Independent Valuation Methods:*
1. **Scorecard Method** -- Qualitative assessment against regional industry benchmarks with weighted scoring across team, market, product, and traction
2. **Checklist (Berkus) Method** -- Intangible asset valuation across 5 critical building blocks: sound idea, prototype, quality team, strategic relationships, and product rollout
3. **Cost Approach** -- Replacement cost analysis of all tangible and intangible assets, including IP premiums and organizational capital
4. **Tiered Revenue VC Method** -- Revenue-quality-adjusted multiples applied across different revenue streams at different growth stages
5. **Simple VC Method (Revenue Multiple)** -- Terminal value estimation using revenue multiples discounted by required investor ROI
6. **Simple VC Method (EBITDA Multiple)** -- EBITDA-based terminal value with industry-appropriate multiples
7. **Simple VC Method (Net Income)** -- P/E multiple approach with earnings-based terminal value
8. **DCF Growth-Adjusted** -- Discounted cash flow analysis with terminal growth rate modeling and multi-scenario discount rates
9. **DCF with EBITDA Multiples** -- Hybrid DCF using EBITDA multiples for terminal value calculation

*Supporting Analysis:*
- Weighted average post-money valuation with method-by-method confidence weighting
- Valuation range (low-mid-high) with statistical basis
- 5-year consolidated financial projections (P&L, cash flow, unit economics) across all business units
- Sum-of-parts enterprise value analysis by business unit
- Capital budget breakdown with detailed allocation
- TAM/SAM/SOM market sizing with CAGR projections
- Scenario analysis (conservative, base, aggressive) with probability-weighted outcomes
- Sensitivity matrices across pricing, occupancy, growth rate, and discount rate
- Break-even analysis and downside protection calculations
- Property/asset scoring methodology with weighted criteria
- 11 detailed appendices covering D&A schedules, expansion economics, pricing sensitivity, and more
- Project IRR, MOIC, and investor return calculations

> **This report is the single most important document in your data room.** When institutional investors conduct due diligence, the valuation report is what they scrutinize first, challenge hardest, and use to anchor every negotiation. A rigorous 9-method analysis doesn't just justify your number -- it demonstrates the kind of financial sophistication that separates fundable companies from aspirational ones. Having 9 independent methods converge on a valuation range is exponentially more defensible than a single-method estimate.

**Market comparable:** Big 4 valuation services (KPMG, EY, Deloitte, PwC) charge **$75K-$200K** for a formal multi-method valuation opinion. Boutique valuation firms and ASA-certified appraisers charge **$40K-$100K** for a standard report. A 9-method IPEV-compliant report with this level of depth -- including full financial projections, scenario analysis, sensitivity matrices, and 11 appendices -- typically runs **$100K-$250K** through a combination of valuation specialists, financial modelers, and industry analysts working 6-8 weeks.

### E. Tax & Legal Architecture

- Jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis with tax optimization
- Board governance documents, committee charters, and bylaws
- Founder guides explaining personal tax implications
- Church/nonprofit structuring (where applicable)

## Competitive Analysis: Why We Win

### Pay for Value and Speed, Not Months and Invoices

The traditional fundraising advisory model is fundamentally broken. Founders don't need a team of consultants billing hours for six months -- they need a finished, investor-ready operating system that works the day it's delivered. The entire industry is built around selling time: monthly retainers, hourly billing, phased engagements that stretch across quarters. Founders pay for process, not product. They pay for meetings about deliverables, not deliverables themselves.

We flipped the model. You pay for a finished, battle-tested fundraising operating system -- 150+ cross-referenced documents, a live interactive investor platform, institutional-grade financial models, and a complete data room -- delivered in 14 to 30 days. Not a team of billable-hour consultants who take 6-12 months to produce a fraction of what we deliver. Not 8 vendors sending 8 invoices on 8 different timelines. One team, one engagement, one invoice, and a complete product that's ready to raise capital the day we hand it over.

The comparison isn't close. Here's the data.

### Head-to-Head Comparison

| Dimension | Big 4 Firms | Boutique IB / Advisory | Startup Consultancies | **Us** |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Total cost for $15-17M raise** | $750K - $2M+ | $596K - $1.15M | $113K - $361K | **$75K - $750K** |
| **Timeline to investor-ready** | 6-12 months | 6-12 months | 4-9 months | **14-30 days** |
| **Deliverables included** | Strategy + tax only | Pitch deck + introductions | Varies by vendor | **150+ documents, all 10 categories** |
| **Financial model quality** | Institutional (part of larger engagement) | Basic to moderate | Moderate (outsourced) | **12-tab linked, variable-driven, institutional-grade** |
| **Enterprise valuation** | Single-method opinion ($75K-$200K extra) | Back-of-napkin or outsourced | Not offered | **9-method IPEV-compliant report with sensitivity analysis** |
| **Interactive investor platform** | Not offered | Not offered | Not offered | **30-page custom Next.js platform** |
| **Data room** | Not included (separate vendor) | Basic folder structure | Third-party VDR subscription | **20+ document organized, gated data room** |
| **Market research depth** | Included if scoped (adds $200K+) | Surface-level competitive scan | Template-based | **Multi-industry, 50+ competitor profiles, TAM/SAM/SOM** |
| **Strategic narrative** | High quality but siloed | Deal-focused, not operational | Generic templates | **Unified across all 150+ documents** |
| **Number of vendors to manage** | 3-5 practice groups | 2-4 external vendors | 4-6 freelancers/firms | **1** |
| **Success fee / hidden costs** | None (but scope creep is standard) | 3-6% success fee ($450K-$1.02M) | None (but change orders add up) | **None. Fixed price, all-inclusive** |
| **Internal consistency** | Low (multiple practice groups) | Low (multiple vendors) | Very low (fragmented) | **Total -- every document cross-references every other** |

### Cost Breakdown: What $750K Actually Buys You Elsewhere

When you look at what comparable infrastructure costs through traditional channels, the math is brutal.

#### The Big 4 Path: $750K - $2M+ | 6-12 Months

| Line Item | Cost Range | What You Get |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Strategy engagement (positioning, GTM, investor narrative) | $500K - $2M | Strategic plan and market positioning |
| Tax structuring (multi-entity, multi-jurisdiction) | $200K - $750K | Entity architecture and tax optimization |
| Financial modeling (part of TAS engagement) | $150K - $500K | Financial model as a component of broader advisory |
| Pitch deck | Not offered | *You'll need a separate agency* |
| Data room platform | Not offered | *You'll need a separate VDR subscription* |
| Interactive investor portal | Not offered | *This doesn't exist in their service catalog* |
| **Total** | **$750K - $2M+** | **Strategy + tax + model only. No pitch materials, no platform, no data room.** |

You're paying top dollar for 3 deliverable categories out of 10. Each practice group runs its own timeline, bills independently, and operates in its own silo. There is no unified narrative. There is no cross-referencing. And you still need to hire 3-4 additional vendors to fill the gaps.

#### The Boutique IB Path: $596K - $1.15M | 6-12 Months

| Line Item | Cost Range | What You Get |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Monthly retainer | $15K - $30K/mo x 6-9 months = $90K - $270K | Access to deal team and investor introductions |
| Success fee on $15-17M raise | 3-6% = $450K - $1.02M | Payable at close (on top of retainer) |
| Pitch deck (usually outsourced) | $10K - $30K | Basic slide deck, not interactive |
| Legal counsel (separate engagement) | $30K - $100K | Securities attorney for PPM/subscription docs |
| Virtual data room | $6K - $24K/yr | Third-party VDR subscription |
| Financial model (if not in-house) | $10K - $50K | Outsourced to modeling specialist |
| **Total** | **$596K - $1.15M** | **Introductions + basic materials. They raise your capital but don't build your infrastructure.** |

The boutique IB model is designed to make introductions and manage a deal process -- not to build the operational and strategic infrastructure that makes investors say yes. You're paying over half a million dollars and still assembling the actual deliverables from multiple vendors.

#### The Startup DIY Path: $113K - $361K | 4-9 Months

| Line Item | Cost Range | What You Get |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Fractional CFO | $5K - $15K/mo x 6-9 months = $30K - $135K | Financial oversight and model management |
| Pitch deck designer/agency | $10K - $30K | Static slide deck |
| Financial modeler (freelance) | $10K - $50K | Standalone spreadsheet model |
| Market research (off-the-shelf + custom) | $15K - $65K | Basic market data |
| Virtual data room | $6K - $24K/yr | Third-party VDR platform |
| Legal (PPM + subscription docs) | $30K - $75K | Securities documentation |
| Brand/design (logo, guidelines) | $12K - $32K | Basic brand assets |
| **Total** | **$113K - $361K** | **Cheapest option, but you're the project manager of your own fundraise.** |

The DIY path looks affordable on paper -- until you factor in the 4-6 vendors you're now managing, the inconsistencies between deliverables from different authors, and the 200+ hours of founder time spent coordinating instead of building the business. Nothing is integrated. Nothing cross-references. And when an investor asks a question that spans two deliverables, the numbers don't match because two different people wrote them.

### The Time Is Money Calculation

Speed isn't a nice-to-have -- it's the single biggest driver of fundraising outcomes. Here's what those extra months actually cost:

**Runway burned while preparing.** If your monthly burn rate is $150K-$300K (typical for a growth-stage company raising $15-17M), every month of fundraising preparation costs $150K-$300K in cash that could be deployed toward growth. The difference between 30 days and 9 months of preparation is **$1.2M - $2.4M in burned runway** -- money spent waiting for consultants instead of building the business.

**Founder time as opportunity cost.** Managing 4-6 vendors across a traditional fundraise consumes 15-25 hours per week of founder time for 6-9 months. That's 360-900 hours of the most valuable person in the company acting as a project manager instead of a CEO. At any reasonable valuation of founder time, that's a six-figure opportunity cost that never shows up on an invoice.

**Market timing risk.** Capital markets shift. Interest rates move. Competitive landscapes change. A fundraising window that's open in Q1 may be closed by Q3. Every month of delay is a month where conditions can move against you -- and a month where a faster competitor can close their round first and change the market narrative.

**Dilution leverage erodes with time.** The longer a fundraise drags on, the more leverage shifts from founder to investor. A company that's investor-ready in 30 days negotiates from strength. A company that's been "preparing to raise" for 9 months signals desperation. Time kills valuation.

### What You Get That Nobody Else Delivers

No competitor in any category -- Big 4, boutique IB, startup consultancy, or DIY assembly -- provides what this platform delivers:

- **150+ cross-referenced documents** -- not siloed deliverables from 8 vendors that don't reference each other
- **Live interactive investor platform** -- a 30-page custom Next.js application, not a PDF pitch deck emailed as an attachment
- **12-tab linked financial model** -- variable-driven with cascading assumptions, not a static spreadsheet with hardcoded numbers
- **9-Point Enterprise Valuation Report** -- IPEV-compliant, 9 independent methods weighted and cross-validated, not a single-method guess on a slide
- **30 days or less from kickoff to investor-ready** -- not 6-12 months of phased engagements and sequential vendor handoffs
- **One team, one narrative, one invoice** -- not 8 vendors, 8 timelines, 8 invoices, and a founder playing project manager
- **Complete fundraising operating system** -- strategy, tax, legal, financial models, market research, operations, investor platform, data room, and design system, all integrated and internally consistent
- **Zero success fees, zero hidden costs** -- fixed-price engagement with everything included, not a retainer plus 3-6% of your raise

## The AI Advantage: Why Our Pricing Works

Our pricing isn't a discount -- it's a structural cost advantage.

### The Data Behind It

We've documented the economics of our own production process:

| Metric | Traditional | Our Model |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Cost reduction** | -- | **96-98%** lower production costs |
| **Delivery timeline** | 6-12 months | **14-30 days** |
| **Team required** | 6-8 specialists across firms | Integrated AI + senior review team |
| **Quality** | High | **High** (validated by institutional-grade output) |
| **Consistency** | Medium (multiple authors, firms) | **High** (unified system, cross-referenced) |

> Our internal cost analysis shows that AI-assisted production of institutional-grade documents achieves **96-98% cost reduction** versus traditional human-only production, while maintaining quality parity when paired with professional review. A single valuation report that costs $37K-$71K through traditional channels costs under $1,500 with our model -- and delivers in hours, not weeks.

### Why This Isn't a Compromise

- **AI handles volume and consistency**: 150+ documents that cross-reference each other perfectly
- **Senior professionals handle judgment**: Strategy, legal review, financial validation
- **The savings are structural**: We don't cut corners -- we eliminated the inefficiency of 8 separate vendor workflows, sequential handoffs, and coordination overhead
- **Speed is a feature**: Raising capital is time-sensitive. Six months of document preparation is six months of runway burned before you even start

## What Makes This Different

This is not a template library. This is not a pitch deck generator. This is not a form-fill service.

### An Integrated System, Not a Collection of Files

Every number in the financial model traces back to the market research. Every claim in the executive summary is supported by the operational blueprint. Every projection in the data room matches the investor platform dashboards. Change one assumption and it cascades through 150+ documents and a live web platform.

### Battle-Tested on a Real Raise

This framework was built for a real company raising real capital -- not in a classroom, not as a theoretical exercise. Every deliverable has been reviewed through the lens of "would an institutional investor write a check based on this?"

### An Interactive Platform, Not Just PDFs

Most fundraising advisory ends with a stack of documents. We deliver a **live, interactive web platform** that investors can explore -- with dashboards, gated access, analytics, and a design system that signals technical competence before you say a word.

### Living Financial Models, Not Static Spreadsheets

The 12-tab Google Sheets model isn't a snapshot -- it's an instrument. Adjust assumptions and watch projections cascade in real time. Investors can stress-test your model themselves, which builds the confidence that closes rounds.

### One Coherent Narrative Across 150+ Documents

From the 30,000-foot vision to the granular SOP, every document tells the same story in the same voice with the same numbers. This level of internal consistency is nearly impossible when 8 different vendors each write their own piece.

## Engagement Model & Timeline

Every engagement follows the same four phases -- compressed to match the tier you select.
